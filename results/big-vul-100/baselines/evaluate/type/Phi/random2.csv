177740,DoS Exec Code Overflow Mem. Corr.," YES

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to a DoS (Denial of Service) due to a potential buffer overflow. The vulnerability arises from the way the code processes the input string `timestr->data` without proper bounds checking.

In the original code, the function `estrdup` is used to duplicate the string pointed to by `timestr->data`. However, the `estrdup` function itself is not shown in the provided code snippet. If `estrdup` does not perform proper bounds checking, it could lead to a buffer overflow when duplicating the string.

Additionally, the code assumes that the input string `timestr->data` is at least 13 characters long. If the input string is shorter than 13 characters, the code returns an error. However, if the input string is exactly 13 characters long, the code will attempt to access `timestr->data[13]`, which is out of bounds for the string. This could lead to a buffer overflow and potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `estrdup` function performs proper bounds checking and that the code checks the length of the input string before accessing its elements.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow_Mem._Corr. vulnerability.

177743,DoS," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `dir` parameter in the `phar_make_dirstream` function. Specifically, the issue is related to the off-by-one error when copying the `dir` string into the `entry` buffer.

In the code, the `dir` string is copied into the `entry` buffer using `memcpy` or `safe_emalloc`. However, the length of the `dir` string is not checked against the size of the `entry` buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the `dir` string is longer than the allocated `entry` buffer.

For example, if the `dir` string is longer than the allocated `entry` buffer, the `memcpy` or `safe_emalloc` function will write past the end of the `entry` buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory. This can lead to a denial of service (uninitialized pointer dereference and application crash) when the `entry` buffer is accessed later in the code.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the length of the `dir` string does not exceed the size of the `entry` buffer before copying it. This can be done by adding a check for the length of the `dir` string and adjusting the size of the `entry` buffer accordingly.","The code contains a DoS vulnerability.

The vulnerability in the code is due to the use of the `fz_try` function without proper error handling. The `fz_try` function is used to execute a block of code that may throw an exception. In the provided code, the `fz_try` block contains a call to `fz_begin_right_mask`, which could potentially throw an exception if an error occurs.

However, the error handling in the `fz_catch` block is not sufficient to prevent a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The `fz_catch` block only checks for the `FZ_ERROR_TRYLATER` error, which is related to a retry attempt after an error has occurred. It does not handle other potential errors that could be thrown by the `fz_begin_right_mask` function.

As a result, an attacker could craft a malicious PDF file that causes the `fz_begin_right_mask` function to throw an exception, leading to a DoS attack by consuming system resources and potentially crashing the application.

The vulnerability in the code is due to the lack of proper error handling and memory management when dealing with ASN.1 data structures. The code does not check the return values of memory allocation functions like `talloc` and `talloc_zero`, which can lead to memory leaks or corruption if the allocation fails. This can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending crafted packets that cause the server to allocate memory without properly freeing it.

Additionally, the code does not check the return values of `asn1_load`, `asn1_start_tag`, `asn1_read_OctetString_talloc`, and `ldap_decode_attribs_bare`. If any of these functions fail, the code should handle the error appropriately instead of blindly continuing execution. This can lead to undefined behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

177789,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gmalloc` function to allocate memory for `cairo_data`. The `gmalloc` function is not a standard C++ function and is specific to the GLib library. It is possible that `gmalloc` could be vulnerable to integer overflow issues, which could lead to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

In the code, the size of the allocated memory is calculated as `cairo_height * cairo_rowstride`. If either `cairo_height` or `cairo_rowstride` is too large, it could cause an integer overflow, leading to a smaller-than-expected memory allocation. This could result in a buffer overflow when the code tries to write to the allocated memory, potentially causing a denial of service or even arbitrary code execution.

To fix this vulnerability, you should replace the use of `gmalloc` with a standard C++ memory allocation function like `new` or `malloc`, and ensure that the size of the allocated memory is within safe bounds. Additionally, you should validate the input values for `scale`, `rotation`, and `transparent` to ensure they are within expected ranges and do not cause any overflows or other issues.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177792,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the code is vulnerable to an integer overflow in the calculation of `rowSize`.


The vulnerability arises from the line `rowSize = (width + 7) >> 3;` in the case `splashModeMono1`. If `width` is large enough, adding 7 to it could cause an integer overflow before the right shift operation is applied. This could result in an incorrect `rowSize` that is too small, leading to a buffer underflow when memory is allocated with `gmalloc(rowSize * height)`.


Additionally, the line `rowSize += rowPad - 1;` could also lead to an integer overflow if `rowSize` is already large. This would again result in an incorrect `rowSize` and potentially cause a buffer underflow during memory allocation.


Both of these issues could lead to a denial of service (application crash) or, in the worst case, arbitrary code execution if the memory allocation functions are not properly handling such cases.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177796,Overflow," YES, the provided code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the way the length of the data buffer is calculated and used. In the original code, the length is calculated as follows:

```cpp
len = p - &(data[0]);
```

This line calculates the length of the buffer by subtracting the address of the first element of the buffer from the current position pointer `p`. However, this length is then used to allocate memory for the `target` variable:

```cpp
*target = xzalloc(len + 1);
```

The problem is that the length `len` is not guaranteed to be the actual size of the data buffer. It is possible that the buffer has been extended by the `rpc_add_credentials` and `nfs_add_fh3` functions, which are not shown in the code snippet. If the actual size of the data buffer is larger than the calculated length `len`, then the `xzalloc` function will allocate a smaller buffer than needed, leading to a buffer overflow when copying the data into the `target` buffer.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer way to determine the actual size of the data buffer, such as using a function that returns the size of the buffer or by passing the size as a parameter to the `nfs_readlink_req","The code contains a Overflow vulnerability.

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to an integer overflow. The vulnerability arises from the calculation of the number of pixels to read from the file, which is determined by multiplying the width and height of the image. If either the width or height is very large, the product could exceed the maximum value that an `int` can hold, leading to an overflow. This overflow could result in a negative value for `n`, which would cause the while loop to execute a negative number of times, potentially leading to out-of-bounds memory access when incrementing the `p` pointer.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-ID CVE-201EE-16612, where integer overflows in the processing of cursors could lead to heap buffer overflows. In this case, the overflow could lead to heap corruption or a crash, which is a security concern.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the code does not properly check the available stack space when the device remains the same. This can lead to a stack overflow, which can be exploited by an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions.

In the code, the check for available stack space is only performed when the LockSafetyParams flag is true and the pagedevice dictionaries of the old and new devices are not the same. However, this check is not performed when the pagedevice dictionaries are the same, which is the case when the device remains the same.

This means that if an attacker can manipulate the pagedevice dictionaries to be the same, they can bypass the stack space check and potentially cause a stack overflow, leading to a vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, the stack space check should be performed regardless of whether the pagedevice dictionaries are the same or not. This can be done by moving the stack space check code outside of the conditional block that checks for the same pagedevice dictionaries.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

The provided code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to the handling of the `code` variable when it is outside the range of the decompression table. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the line:

```cpp
if (code >= file->free_ent) {

```

When `code` is greater than or equal to `file->free_ent`, the code assumes that the `code` is a valid index in the decompression table and writes the `finchar` to the `stackp` buffer. However, if `code` is not a valid index, this can lead to a buffer overflow because the code does not check if `stackp` is still within the bounds of the allocated buffer.

This vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-ID CVE-2011-2895, where the decompressor does not properly handle code words that are absent from the decompression table, potentially leading to an infinite loop or a heap-based buffer overflow.

The provided C++ code is vulnerable to a DoS Overflow attack due to the way it handles JSON parsing and the potential for unbounded recursion or excessive memory allocation when processing certain JSON values. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the handling of JSON arrays and composite types, which can be exploited to cause a denial of service by creating deeply nested or very large JSON structures that the server cannot process efficiently.

In the code, the `array_to_json_internal` function is called when a JSON array is encountered. This function is not shown in the provided code snippet, but if it is not implemented with proper bounds checking and memory management, it could lead to a stack overflow or excessive memory allocation when processing deeply nested arrays or very large arrays.

Additionally, the `composite_to_json` function is called when a JSON composite type is encountered. Again, without proper bounds checking and memory management, this function could also lead to a stack overflow or excessive memory allocation when processing deeply nested composite types or very large composite structures.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the implementation of `array_to_json_internal` and `composite_to_json` should include proper bounds checking and memory management to prevent excessive recursion or memory allocation. Additionally, the server should have mechanisms in place to detect and handle excessively large or deeply nested JSON structures to prevent denial of service attacks.","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

The provided code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles the '*' and '?' characters in the pattern matching function. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the incorrect handling of '\0' characters when '?' is encountered in the pattern.

In the original code, when a '?' character is encountered, the function decrements the `stringdashes` counter if the current character in the string is `XK_minus`. However, the code does not handle the case where the current character is a '\0' character, which could lead to a buffer over-read.

In the modified code, the handling of '?' is the same, but the handling of '\0' has been changed. The code now decrements both `patdashes` and `stringdashes` counters when a '\0' character is encountered. This change does not address the original vulnerability and could potentially introduce a new one.

The vulnerability in the original code is due to the fact that when a '?' character is encountered, the function does not check if the current character in the string is '\0'. This could lead to a situation where the function continues to read beyond the end of the string, causing a buffer over-read and potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly check the bounds of the `fdctrl->fifo` array when accessing its elements. Specifically, the line `retval = fdctrl->fifo[pos];` can lead to an out-of-bounds write if `pos` is greater than or equal to `FD_SECTOR_LEN`, which is the size of the `fifo` array.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) or potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly sanitize or restrict the use of wildcard characters (`*` and `?`) and parent directory references (`..`) in the `permitlist`. This can allow an attacker to bypass file permission checks by crafting a `permitlist` entry that matches any file or directory on the system, potentially leading to unautpta

The `getPrefix` function is intended to preprocess the `permitlist` entries to optimize the string matching process. However, the vulnerability is not in the `getPrefix` function itself but in how the `permitlist` entries are used in the `check_file_permissions_reduced` function.

The `check_file_permissions_reduced` function iterates over the `permitlist` and uses the `string_match` function to compare the `fname` with the `permstr` (the permission string). If the `permstr` contains wildcard characters or parent directory references, it can match any file or directory on the system, effectively bypassing the permission check.

The provided code is vulnerable to a DoS (Denial of Service) overflow. The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper bounds checking when allocating memory. Specifically, the code does not check if the `size` parameter exceeds the available memory (`mmem->limit - sizeof(gs_malloc_block_t)`) before attempting to allocate memory. This can lead to an integer overflow when calculating the `added` variable, which is then used to allocate memory. If `size` is large enough, this could result in a negative value for `added`, leading to an out-of-bounds write or read when allocating memory.

Additionally, the code does not check if the allocation was successful before proceeding to use the allocated memory. If the allocation fails (e.g., due to insufficient memory), the code will still attempt to use the `ptr` variable, which could lead to undefined behavior.

177901,Overflow," YES, the provided code is vulnerable to an overflow.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `temp` array is used to store the string representation of the number `v`. If `v` is a large number, the loop that converts `v` to a string may write past the end of the `temp` array, leading to a buffer overflow. This can result in undefined behavior, including the potential for arbitrary code execution or crashing the program.

In the given code, the `temp` array has a fixed size `LTOSTR_MAX_SIZE`, but there is no check to ensure that the number being converted does not exceed this size. If `v` is larger than what can be represented in `LTOSTR_MAX_SIZE` characters, the code will write past the end of the `temp` array, causing a buffer overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add a check to ensure that the number being converted does not exceed the size of the `temp` array. For example, you could add a condition to the loop that converts `v` to a string, like this:

```cpp
do
{
    d = v / 10;
    r = v - d * 10;
    if (count >= LTOSTR_MAX_SIZE - 1)

177905,DoS," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in the code is due to the potential for a NULL pointer dereference. The issue arises when the `det` variable, which is the determinant of the transformation matrix, is close to zero. If `det` is less than `1e-6`, the function returns early, which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference if `scaledMask` is not properly initialized or if the `scaleMask` function does not handle the case when `det` is zero.

In the provided code snippet, the `scaledMask` variable is assigned the result of the `scaleMask` function, which is not shown in the snippet. If `scaleMask` does not handle the case when `det` is zero, it could return a NULL pointer. Since `scaledMask` is not checked for NULL before being used, this could lead to a NULL pointer dereference.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that `scaledMask` is properly initialized and that the `scaleMask` function handles the case when `det` is zero, returning a valid pointer or indicating an error condition. Additionally, the code should check for NULL before using `scaledMask`.","The code contains a DoS vulnerability.

177911,Exec Code Overflow," YES, the code is vulnerable to Exec_Code_Overflow.

The vulnerability arises from the way the code calculates the length and count variables without proper bounds checking. In the given code snippet, the length and count are determined by reading values from the table pointer. However, there is no check to ensure that the values read are within the bounds of the table. This can lead to an integer overflow, where the calculated length or count exceeds the size of the table, causing the program to read or write outside the bounds of the table.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code by crafting a table input that causes the program to read or write outside the bounds of the table, potentially overwriting important data or code.

The vulnerability lies in the following lines:

```cpp
length = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
```

and

```cpp
num_groups = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );

The function `TT_NEXT_ULONG(p)` is used to read an unsigned long integer from the memory location pointed by `p`. If the value of `length` or `num_groups` exceeds the maximum value that an unsigned long integer can hold (which is 4,294,967,295), an integer overflow will occur. This can lead to incorrect values being used in subsequent calculations, potentially causing the program to behave unexpectedly or even crash.

In the context of the provided code, an integer overflow in `length` or `num_groups` could result in the function `tt_cmap12_validate` processing incorrect data, which may lead to a vulnerability being exploited by an attacker.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to an integer overflow in the `tt_cmap8_validate` function. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the following line:

```cpp
if (start_id + end - start >= TT_VALID_GLYPH_COUNT(valid))
```

In this line, the variables `start_id`, `end`, and `start` are all of type `FT_UInt32`, which is an unsigned 32-bit integer. The `TT_VALID_GLYPH_COUNT(valid)` function call also returns an unsigned 32-bit integer.

The vulnerability occurs when the sum of `start_id`, `end`, and `-start` exceeds the maximum value of an unsigned 32-bit integer (2^32 - 1). In this case, the result of the addition will wrap around to a small value, causing the condition to be false and allowing the function to proceed without detecting an invalid glyph ID.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious input that causes the integer overflow, leading to an incorrect validation result and potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a larger integer type (e.s., `FT_SInt32` or `FT_SInt64`)","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

and

```cpp

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it handles the `rlen` variable. The vulnerability is similar to the one described in CVE-2010-0737, where the `rlen` variable is calculated using a right shift operation on `rep.length`. If `rep.length` is larger than `INT_MAX / 2`, this will result in undefined behavior due to integer overflow.

In the original vulnerable code, the issue was with the line:

```c
rlen = rep.length << 2;
```

If `rep.length` is greater than `INT_MAX / 4`, the result of `rep.length << 2` will overflow the `int` type, leading to an incorrect value for `rlen`. This can cause an out-of-bounds write when allocating memory for `ch` and reading data into it.

In the provided code, the vulnerability still exists because the calculation of `rlen` is not changed:

```c
rlen = rep.length << 2;

This line is still susceptible to integer overflow if `rep.length` is too large. To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that `rlen` is calculated in a way that prevents integer overflow, such as by using a larger integer type or by adding a check to ensure","The code contains a Exec_Code vulnerability.

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it handles the `ch` pointer and the `rlen` variable. The vulnerability arises from the assumption that the server's response will always conform to the expected format, which is not guaranteed. If the server sends a response that does not match the expected length or format, the code may read beyond the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

In the code, `rlen` is calculated as `rep.length << 2`, which assumes that the length is in bytes and converts it to words (2 bytes each) for the Xlib protocol. However, if the server sends a response with a length that is not a multiple of 2, this conversion could lead to an incorrect `rlen` value.

Additionally, the code assumes that the server will send a null-terminated string for each font name. If the server does not adhere to this format, the code may read past the end of the buffer when it tries to find the length of the next font name.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-ID CVE-2018-14599, where an off-by-one error in the `XListExtensions` function in `ListExt.c` of the libX11 library could lead to a DoS or other unspecified impacts.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

177920,," YES, the provided code is vulnerable due to a potential buffer overflow issue.

The vulnerability arises from the way the code reads the data from the display into the buffer `ch`. The code assumes that the length of the data read is less than `INT_MAX >> 2`, which is a reasonable check. However, the vulnerability comes from the fact that the code does not check if the actual length of the data read is less than or equal to `nbytes`.

In the loop where the code unpacks the null-terminated strings, it reads the length of the next string from the buffer `ch` and then increments `ch` by `length + 1` to skip over the length of the current string. This assumes that the length read is accurate and that there is enough space in the buffer to store the length of the next string.

If the server sends a response with a length that is greater than `nbytes`, the code will still attempt to read the length of the next string from the buffer `ch`. This can lead to a buffer overflow, as the code will read beyond the allocated memory for `ch`. This can cause a crash or potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the length of the data read is always less than or equal to `nbytes`. This can be done by adding a check before reading the length of","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

The provided code snippet is vulnerable due to the same off-by-one error that was present in the original vulnerable code. The error occurs in the loop where the code attempts to read the lengths of the extensions and then skips over them to read the next length. The loop condition `if (ch + length < chend)` may allow an attacker to manipulate the server response to cause an off-by-one error, leading to a buffer overflow or other unspecified impacts.

In the loop, the code reads the length of the next extension and then skips over it by adding `length + 1` to the pointer `ch`. However, if the server response is manipulated in such a way that the length is not followed by a null-terminator, the code will read past the end of the buffer, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the server response is properly formatted and that the lengths of the extensions are followed by a null-terminator.

The vulnerability lies in the `add_param_to_argv` function, specifically in the loop that copies characters into `param_buffer`. The loop does not properly handle the case when the buffer is full, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability occurs in the following part of the code:

```cpp

The `param_buffer` is a fixed-size array of 1024 characters. The code checks if `param_len` (the current length of the buffer) is greater than or equal to the size of `param_buffer` before copying a new character. However, this check is not performed before incrementing `param_len` with `param_len++`. This means that if `param_len` is already equal to the size of `param_buffer`, the next character will be written outside the bounds of the array, causing a buffer overflow.

The provided C++ code for the `move_uploaded_file` function is vulnerable to the same Bypass vulnerability as described in the original PHP code. The vulnerability arises from the handling of file paths that contain null bytes (`\x00`). The code uses the `VCWD_RENAME` function to rename the file, which may truncate the path at the first occurrence of a null byte. This truncation can allow an attacker to bypass file extension restrictions and potentially place files in unintended locations.

The vulnerability is due to the incomplete fix for CVE-2006-72EE, which was supposed to address the issue of null byte handling in file paths. The incomplete fix in the provided code still allows for the possibility of bypassing intended file restrictions by crafting a file path with a null byte.

The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to a potential buffer overflow. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `EVP_SealInit` function without proper bounds checking on the size of the `buf` buffer allocated for the encrypted data.

In the `EVP_SealInit` call, the buffer `buf` is allocated with a size of `data_len + EVP_CIPHER_CTX_block_size(ctx)`. However, the `EVP_SealUpdate` and `EVP_SealFinal` functions are called without checking if the size of the encrypted data (`len1 + len2`) exceeds the allocated buffer size.
