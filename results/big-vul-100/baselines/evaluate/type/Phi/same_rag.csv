The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `dir` parameter when it is a subdirectory. The code does not properly check the length of `dir` before using it in string operations. This can lead to an off-by-one error when the length of `dir` is not correctly accounted for, potentially causing a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the handling of file shrinkage during read access. When a file is being archived using the `--sparse` option, the code does not properly handle the case where the file size has been reduced (shrunk) by another process. This can lead to an infinite read loop in the `sparse_dump_region` function, causing a denial of service.

In the code, the `bytes_left` variable is decremented by the number of bytes read in each iteration of the while loop. However, if the file size has been reduced by another process during the read operation, the `bytes_left` variable will not be updated to reflect the new file size. This can cause the loop to continue indefinitely, as the `bytes_left` variable will never reach zero.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the file size before each read operation and update the `bytes_left` variable accordingly. This can be done by using the `fstat` system call to obtain the current file size and comparing it to the `bytes_left` variable. If the file size has been reduced, the `bytes_left` variable should be updated to reflect the new file size. This will ensure that the loop terminates when the entire file has been read, even if the file size has been reduced during the read operation.","The code contains a DoS vulnerability.

177786,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the way the `imgData.lookup` memory is allocated and used. The code allocates memory for `imgData.lookup` based on the number of pixel components (`colorMap->getNumPixelComps()`) and the number of bits per component (`colorMap->getBits()`). This allocation is done using `gmalloc`, which is a custom memory allocation function.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not check if the allocated memory size is within a safe range. If the number of bits per component is too large, the allocated memory size could be too large, leading to a potential integer overflow when calculating the size of the `imgData.lookup` array. This could result in a buffer overflow when the code tries to access the allocated memory.

Additionally, the code does not check if the allocated memory size is a multiple of the size of a `Guchar` (which is likely a pointer type). If the allocated memory size is not a multiple of the size of a `Guchar`, this could lead to a misaligned memory access, which can cause a crash or other undefined behavior.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should add checks to ensure that the allocated memory size is within a safe range and that it is a multiple of the size of a `Guchar`. This can be done by adding checks before the memory","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it handles memory allocation and deallocation for the `imgData.lookup` array. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `imgData.lookup` array is allocated with `gmalloc` and then freed with `gfree`, but there is no check to ensure that the allocated memory is properly deallocated if an error occurs or if the allocation fails. This can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability if the `imgData.lookup` pointer is accessed after it has been freed.

Additionally, the code does not check the return value of `gmalloc` to ensure that the memory allocation was successful. If `gmalloc` fails to allocate memory and returns a null pointer, the subsequent code that uses `imgData.lookup` may cause a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should include proper error checking for memory allocation and ensure that allocated memory is only accessed while it is valid.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177788,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the integer overflow that can occur when allocating memory for the lookup arrays. In the code, the size of the lookup array is determined by the number of pixel components in the color map (colorMap->getNumPixelComps()) and the number of bits per pixel component (colorMap->getBits()). The size of the lookup array is calculated as 1 << colorMap->getBits().

If the number of bits per pixel component is too large, the size of the lookup array can exceed the maximum value that can be represented by an integer, leading to an integer overflow. This can result in a smaller-than-expected size for the lookup array, which can cause a buffer overflow when the array is filled with pixel values.

A buffer overflow can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) crash or a potential arbitrary code execution vulnerability if an attacker can control the input data. In this case, an attacker could craft a color map with a large number of bits per pixel component, causing an integer overflow and a buffer overflow when the lookup array is filled with pixel values.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should check for integer overflow when calculating the size of the lookup array and handle the case where the size exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by an integer.

177789,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the calculation of `cairo_width` and `cairo_height` using the `ceil` function on the product of `width` and `scale`. If `scale` is a very large number, this could lead to an integer overflow, which in turn could cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. This is because the `ceil` function returns a `double`, and when this value is cast to an `int`, it could overflow if the resulting `double` value is too large to be represented by an `int`.

Additionally, the memory allocation for `cairo_data` is done using `gmalloc`, which is not a standard C++ memory allocation function and could potentially be unsafe or not properly checked for overflows.

The vulnerability in the code is due to the potential for integer overflow when calculating the `rowSize` and during the `memcpy` operation. The `rowSize` is calculated as `(bitmap->w + 7) >> 3`, which could lead to an integer overflow if `bitmap->w` is large enough. This overflow could result in an incorrect `rowSize` value, which in turn could cause the `memcpy` operation to write beyond the allocated memory for `bitmap->data`, leading to a buffer overflow.

Additionally, the code does not check if the `memcpy` operation is copying more data than the allocated size for `bitmap->data`. If `slot->bitmap.rows` is larger than the allocated size for `bitmap->data`, this would also result in a buffer overflow.

Both of these issues can lead to a denial of service (application crash) or potentially allow arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the input values that lead to these overflows.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability lies in the way the code handles the AS_PATH length calculation for long paths. The code counts certain bytes twice when constructing the AS_PATH, which can lead to an invalid message being sent. This can cause a denial of service (session drop) via BGP UPDATE messages.

In the code, the while loop that processes the segments checks if the length of the current segment is less than or equal to STREAM_WRITEABLE(s). If it is, the code proceeds to write the segment data to the stream. However, if the length of the segment is greater than STREAM_WRITEABLE(s), the code splits the segment into smaller parts and writes them to the stream.

The problem arises when the code encounsutters a segment that is longer than STREAM_WRITEABLE(s) and splits it into smaller parts. The code does not properly update the length of the segment header when writing the smaller parts to the stream. This can result in an invalid AS_PATH message being sent, which can cause a denial of service.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly update the length of the segment header when writing the smaller parts to the stream. This can be done by keeping track of the total length of the smaller parts and updating the segment header accordingly.","The code contains a DoS vulnerability.

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it handles the conversion of UTF16 characters to codepoints. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly validate the length of the output buffer (`outbuf`) before performing the `smb_iconv` conversion. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the output buffer is not large enough to hold the converted data.

In the code, `outbuf` is initially set to point to `buf`, which is a local array of size 4. The `smb_iconv` function is then called twice, first with `olen` set to 2 and then with `olen` set to 4. If the conversion results in more than 4 bytes being written to `outbuf`, it will overflow the bounds of `buf`, leading to a potential buffer overflow vulnerability.

This vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious input that causes the `smb_iconv` function to write more than 4 bytes to `outbuf`, potentially allowing an attacker to read sensitive information from the daemon's heap memory.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the output buffer is large enough to hold the converted data before calling `smb_iconv`. Additionally, the code should validate the length of the output buffer and handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during the conversion process.","The code contains a +Info vulnerability.

177840,+Info," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the handling of the string length and the escape character logic. The function `ldb_dn_escape_internal` is designed to escape certain characters in a string, but it does not properly handle the case where the input string `src` is longer than the specified length `len`. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is not properly null-terminated or if it contains more characters than expected.

Additionally, the escape character logic is flawed. The function attempts to escape certain characters, but the logic for escaping characters at the beginning or end of the string is duplicated and incorrect. The code snippet provided has a `break` statement after the `if` block that should only be executed if the character is not a space. However, the `break` statement is outside of the `if` block, which means it will always be executed, causing the loop to exit prematurely.

Moreover, the function does not check for the null-terminator of the input string, which can lead to reading beyond the end of the string if `len` is not accurate. This can result in undefined behavior and potential information disclosure if the function is used in a context where it is expected to handle strings of a certain length.

The vulnerability lies in the handling of string lengths and the potential for buffer overflows. The function `strlen_m_ext_handle` is designed to calculate the length of a string in a specific character set. However, the code does not perform bounds checking on the input string `s` before it is processed. This can lead to a situation where the function reads beyond the end of the allocated memory for the string, which is a classic buffer overflow vulnerability.

In the context of the vulnerability summary provided (CVE-2015-5330), the issue is that the function mishandles string lengths, which can allow an attacker to read sensitive information from the daemon's heap memory. While the provided code snippet does not directly show the interaction with the AD LDAP server or the crafting of packets, the underlying problem of mishandling string lengths and potential buffer overflows is present.

The function assumes that the input string `s` is well-formed and does not contain any null bytes (`'\0'`) before the actual end of the string. If an attacker can control the input and provide a string that is shorter than expected or contains null bytes at unexpected positions, the function may read beyond the intended memory area, leading to a buffer overflow.

The provided C++ code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to a potential buffer overflow in the `json_to_json` function. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the handling of the `JSONTYPE_NUMERIC` case, where the `outputstr` buffer is allocated without a fixed size and then filled with data from `OidOutputFunctionCall(outfuncoid, val)`. If the output from this function call exceeds the size of the `outputstr` buffer, it could lead to a buffer overflow.

In the case of a buffer overflow, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a JSON numeric value that is larger than the allocated buffer size. This could potentially overwrite adjacent memory, leading to a crash or allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the `outputstr` buffer is allocated with a sufficient size to hold the maximum possible output from `OidOutputFunctionCall(outfuncoid, val)`. Additionally, the code should check the length of the output before copying it into the `outputstr` buffer to prevent buffer overflows.","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

The code is vulnerable because it uses a shell command to execute the editor program, which can be manipulated to execute arbitrary commands. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `execl` function with a string that is constructed from user-controlled input (the `buf` variable). If an attacker can control the contents of `buf`, they can inject additional shell commands to be executed.

In the code, the `buf` variable is constructed with the editor program name and the output file name. If an attacker can control the output file name, they can inject shell metacharacters or additional commands into `buf`. For example, an attacker could provide an output file name like `; rm -rf /`, which would result in the command being executed as `/bin/sh -c ""/bin/sh; rm -rf /""`. This would cause the shell to execute the `rm -rf /` command, potentially leading to a complete system wipe.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer method to execute the editor program, such as using the `execvp` function with a fixed command and arguments, or using a library that provides a safe way to execute external commands with user-controlled input.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

177857,," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the way the code handles the allocation of memory for the buffer. The code uses the `malloc` function to allocate memory based on the file size (`instat.st_size`). However, the code does not check if the file size is a valid size that can be represented by a `size_t` type. This can lead to a situation where the file size is larger than the maximum value that can be represented by a `size_t`, causing an integer overflow.

When an integer overflow occurs, the resulting buffer size may be smaller than the actual file size, leading to a buffer overflow when the file is read into the buffer. This can result in the overwriting of adjacent memory, potentially leading to a crash or allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

Additionally, the code does not check if the `malloc` call was successful. If `malloc` fails to allocate the requested memory, it will return a null pointer. In this case, the code will proceed to use the null pointer as a buffer, which can also lead to a crash or other undefined behavior.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the file size is within the valid range of a `size_t` before allocating memory. It should also check if `malloc` returns a non-null pointer before using the allocated memory.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

This negative value is then compared with `size`, which is a positive value, and the condition will always be true, leading to an incorrect allocation.

This vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a Postscript file that requests a large allocation size, causing the function to allocate more memory than intended and potentially leading to a denial of service (crash) or other unintended behavior.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to ensure that the subtraction operation does not result in a negative value. One possible solution is to use the `size_t` data type for the `size` parameter and perform the subtraction operation using the `size_t` data type, which is guaranteed to be an unsigned integer type.

For example, if an attacker can control the value at offset 4 (which is used to calculate the length), they could set it to a very large value, causing an integer overflow when adding 16 to it.

The provided code is vulnerable to an integer overflow in the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` function calls. This function is used to read 4-byte unsigned long integers from the `table` array. If the `table` array contains values that, when interpreted as unsigned long integers, exceed the maximum value that can be represented by an unsigned long (which is typically 2^32 - 1 or 4,294,967,295), the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` function will wrap around and produce incorrect values.

This can lead to incorrect calculations of `length`, `num_groups`, `start`, `end`, and `start_id`, which are used to validate the data structure.

177921,," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `chend` pointer and the `length` variable. The code assumes that the length of the next extension is always present and correctly formatted in the buffer. However, if the server response is maliciously crafted, it could provide a length that is larger than the actual data available in the buffer, leading to an off-by-one error.

This can result in reading past the end of the buffer, which can cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) or other unspecified impacts. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper bounds checking and validation of the data received from the server.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

177922,Exec Code Overflow," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the way the code handles the buffer `param_buffer`. The buffer is statically allocated with a fixed size of 1024 bytes. The code does not properly check the length of the input before copying it into the buffer. If the input string is longer than 1023 characters (plus the null terminator), it will cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to a crash or, in a worst-case scenario, arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the provided CVE-ID CVE-2EE-11360, where a buffer overflow in iptables-restore in netfilter iptables 1.8.2 allows an attacker to crash the program or potentially gain code execution via a specially crafted iptables-save file.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly check the length of the input string and ensure that it does not exceed the size of the buffer before copying it. Additionally, using safer functions like `strncpy` or `snprintf` can help prevent buffer overflows.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2019-11360. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

177923,Bypass," YES

The provided C++ code for the `move_uploaded_file` function is vulnerable to the Bypass vulnerability (CVE-2015-2348, CWE-264) due to the same reason as the original PHP code snippet. The vulnerability arises from the handling of the `path` and `new_path` parameters, which are parsed and used without proper sanitization or validation to prevent the inclusion of null bytes (`\x00`). This allows an attacker to bypass file extension restrictions by crafting a `new_path` that includes a null byte followed by a different file extension, potentially leading to the creation of files with unexpected names and locations.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-2348. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.
Vulnerability summary:
The move_uploaded_file implementation in ext/standard/basic_functions.c in PHP before 5.4.39, 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 truncates a pathname upon encountering a \x00 character, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended extension restrictions and create files with unexpected names via a crafted second argument.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-7243.

177926,Exec Code Overflow," YES, the code is still vulnerable.

The vulnerability arises from the potential for an integer overflow when calculating the size of the buffer needed to store the decoded base64 data. The line `img_data = g_try_malloc0 (base64_len * 3 / 4);` calculates the size of the buffer by dividing the length of the base64 data by 4 (since base64 encoding represents every 4 characters as 3 bytes) and then multiplying by 3. If `base64_len` is very large, this multiplication could overflow the `gsize` type, leading to a smaller buffer being allocated than is needed.

When the `g_base64_decode_step` function is called, it may write more data into `img_data` than the allocated buffer can hold, causing a heap-based buffer overflow. This overflow can lead to undefined behavior, including the potential for arbitrary code execution, which is the essence of the CVE-2009-0586 vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the buffer size calculation does not overflow and that the buffer is large enough to hold the decoded data. Additionally, the code should check the return value of `g_base64_decode_step` to ensure that the decoding was successful and that the buffer was not overrun","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
