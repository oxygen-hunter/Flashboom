177740,DoS Exec Code Overflow Mem. Corr.," YES, the provided code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow_Mem._Corr. vulnerability.

The vulnerability lies in the way the code handles the parsing of the time string. The code assumes that the time string is always in the correct format and does not perform any validation or error checking on the input. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input time string is longer than expected.

In the original code, the vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not check if the input time string is at least 13 characters long before attempting to parse it. If the input time string is shorter than 13 characters, the code will still attempt to parse it, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

In the modified code, the check for the length of the input time string has been added, which prevents the buffer overflow in the case of a short input time string. However, the vulnerability still exists in the case of a long input time string that exceeds the size of the `strbuf` buffer.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should perform proper input validation and error checking to ensure that the input time string is in the correct format and does not exceed the size of the `strbuf` buffer. Additionally, the code should use safer string manipulation functions, such as `strncpy` and `strncat`, to prevent buffer overflows.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow_Mem._Corr. vulnerability.

The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `softmask` pointer. In the first code snippet, the `softmask` pointer is dereferenced without proper null checks before it is used. This can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability if the `softmask` pointer has been freed or is invalid.

In the provided code, the `softmask` pointer is assigned to `save->softmask` and then dereferenced in the `pdf_xobject_bbox` and `pdf_xobject_matrix` functions. If `softmask` is NULL or has been freed, this can lead to a crash or undefined behavior.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add proper null checks before dereferencing the `softmask` pointer. For example:

```cpp
if (softmask) {
    pdf_xobject_bbox(ctx, softmask, &mask_bbox);
    pdf_xobject_matrix(ctx, softmask, &mask_matrix);

The vulnerability lies in the repeated allocation of memory for the `control` variable without checking if the allocation was successful. This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if an attacker sends crafted packets that cause the server to allocate memory without success, eventually exhausting system resources.

In the code, `control` is allocated twice without checking if the allocation was successful:

```cpp
control = talloc(mem_ctx, struct dsdb_openldap_dereference_result_control);
if (!control) return false;

if (!asn1_load(data, in)) {

However, the vulnerability still exists because the code does not check the return value of the `talloc` function, which is used for memory allocation.

The vulnerability lies in the handling of the compressed DNS name pointers. In the code, when a compressed pointer is encountered (indicated by the most significant bit being set to 1), the code attempts to decompress the pointer by using the value pointed to by the compressed pointer as an offset from the current position.

The provided code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the potential for integer overflow in the following line:

```cpp
n = 1 << colorMap->getBits();
```

This line calculates the number of possible colors based on the number of bits per pixel in the color map. If the value of `colorMap->getBits()` is too large, the resulting value of `n` could overflow, leading to an incorrect number of colors being allocated in memory. This could cause a buffer overflow when accessing the `lookup` array, potentially leading to a DoS attack or even arbitrary code execution.

Additionally, the code does not check for integer overflow in the following loop:

177789,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gmalloc` function to allocate memory for `cairo_data`. If the allocation fails due to insufficient memory, the function will return a null pointer. However, the code does not check for this condition before using the pointer. This can lead to a null pointer dereference when attempting to use `cairo_data` in the `memset` function or when passing it to `cairo_image_surface_create_for_data`.

A null pointer dereference can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service. Additionally, if the attacker can control the input parameters, they might be able to craft a situation where the memory allocation fails, causing the application to crash.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the return value of `gmalloc` and handle the case where the allocation fails. For example:

```cpp
cairo_data = (guchar *) gmalloc (cairo_height * cairo_rowstride);
if (cairo_data == nullptr) {
    // Handle the allocation failure, e.g., by logging an error and returning
    return;
}
```

By adding this check, the code will not attempt to use `cairo_data` if","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177792,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the calculation of `rowSize` and the subsequent memory allocation using `gmalloc`. The `rowSize` is calculated based on the `width` and the `mode`, and then adjusted by adding `rowPad - 1` and subtracting the remainder of `rowSize` divided by `rowPad`. This could lead to an integer overflow if the resulting `rowSize` is too large to be represented by an `int`.

When `gmalloc` is called with `rowSize * height`, if `rowSize` is too large, it could cause an integer overflow, leading to a smaller-than-expected allocation size. This could result in a buffer overflow when the allocated memory is accessed, potentially causing a denial of service or arbitrary code execution.

Additionally, the code does not check for successful memory allocation after calling `gmalloc`. If `gmalloc` fails to allocate memory and returns a null pointer, the subsequent code that assumes a valid pointer could lead to undefined behavior, which is another potential vulnerability.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the code should include checks for integer overflow when calculating `rowSize` and ensure that memory allocation is successful before using the allocated memory.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The provided code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow. The vulnerability arises from the handling of the `code` variable when it is equal to `CLEAR` and `file->block_compress` is true. In this case, the code resets the `tab_prefix` array to zeros and sets `file->clear_flg` to 1, which indicates that the dictionary is cleared. However, the subsequent call to `getcode(file)` does not properly handle the case where the dictionary is empty or reset. If the dictionary is empty, the `getcode` function may return a code that is not present in the `tab_prefix` and `tab_suffix` arrays, leading to an out-of-bounds access when trying to generate output characters.

Additionally, the code does not check if the `code` variable is within the valid range of the `tab_prefix` and `tab_suffix` arrays before using it as an index. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the `code` variable contains a value that is outside the bounds of the arrays.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `snprintf` with the `destFileName` containing a format specifier `%d`. This can lead to a format string vulnerability if `destFileName` contains format specifiers that are not properly escaped or if it is controlled by an attacker. The vulnerability is similar to the one described in CVE-2PD-2013-4474, where an attacker could cause a denial of service by crafting a `destFileName` that includes format specifiers that `snprintf` would try to process.

In the code snippet provided, the `snprintf` function is used to create a filename for each page extracted from the PDF document. The `destFileName` is expected to contain a placeholder `%d` that will be replaced with the page number. If an attacker can control the `destFileName` and include additional format specifiers or other unexpected input, it could lead to a buffer overflow or other unexpected behavior, potentially causing a denial of service.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to ensure that `destFileName` is properly validated and sanitized before being used in the `snprintf` function call.

In the case where `rc > 0`, the code allocates memory for `value` and reads the ACL data into it. If an error occurs during the reading process, the code sets `acl` to `NULL` or `ERR_PTR(rc)`. However, the allocated memory for `value` is not freed in this case, leading to a memory leak.

Additionally, the code does not handle the case where `rc` is negative due to an error in reading the ACL data. In this case, the code sets `acl` to `NULL` or `ERR_PTR(rc)`, but it does not free the allocated memory for `value`. This can also lead to a memory leak.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should free the allocated memory for `value` in all error cases, including when `rc` is negative. This can be done by adding a check for `rc > 0` before freeing the memory, and by freeing the memory in the `else` branch","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

The vulnerability lies in the handling of the string length and the escape character logic. The code assumes that the length of the input string (`len`) is accurate and does not perform any bounds checking when copying the string or escaping characters.

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles the '*' and '?' characters during pattern matching. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the incorrect handling of '\0' characters when matching '?' characters.

In the original vulnerable code, when a '*' character is encountered, the code correctly handles the '\0' character by decrementing `patdashes` and `stringdashes`. However, when a '?' character is encountered, the code does not handle the '\0' character correctly. It decrements `stringdashes` if a 'XK_minus' character is found, but it does not handle the case where a '\0' character is encountered after a '?' character.

In the provided code snippet, the handling of '\0' characters for '?' characters seems to be corrected, as it decrements `stringdashes` when a 'XK_sinus' character is found and returns 0 if a '\0' character is encountered. However, the vulnerability still exists because the code does not handle the case where a '\0' character is encountered after a '?' character and before a '*' or '\0' character. This can lead to a buffer over-read, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the code does not check the size of the input array before copying it into the output array. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input array is larger than the output array, which is 16 bytes in size.

In the provided code, the input array is passed as a parameter to the function `aes_crypt_ecb`, and the output array is also passed as a parameter. However, there is no check to ensure that the input array is not larger than 16 bytes. If an attacker provides an input array larger than EE_BLOCK_SIZE (16 bytes), it will cause a buffer overflow when copying the input array to the output array.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should include a check to ensure that the input array is not larger than the output array before copying it. This can be done by adding a conditional statement to check the size of the input array and return an error if it is larger than the output array.

This can lead to an out-of-bounds write if `pos` is greater than or equal to `FD_SECTOR_LEN`, which is the size of the `fifo` array.

In the code, `pos` is calculated as `fdctrl->data_pos % FD_SECTOR_LEN` when `FD_MSR_NONDMA` is set in the `msr` register. This modulo operation ensures that `pos` is always within the bounds of the `fifo` array. However, the vulnerability lies in the fact that the `data_pos` variable is incremented after accessing the `fifo` array, and the code does not check if `data_pos` has reached the end of the `fifo` array before incrementing it.

If an attacker can manipulate the `data_pos` variable to a value greater than or equal to `FD_SECTOR_LEN`, they can cause an out-of-bounds write when the `fdctrl_read_data` function is called. This can lead to a denial of","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The provided code is vulnerable to a DoS (Denial of Service) overflow. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly check for integer overflow when calculating the `added` variable, which is the sum of `size` and `sizeof(gs_malloc_block_t)`. If `size` is large enough, this sum could overflow the bounds of an `uint` (assuming `uint` is an unsigned integer type), leading to an incorrect value for `added`. This incorrect value could then be used to allocate memory, potentially causing a buffer overflow or other undefined behavior.


The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-ID CVE-2015-3228, where an integer overflow can lead to a denial of service. In the context of the provided code, if the `added` variable overflows, it could result in allocating less memory than requested or even no memory at all, which could cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.


To fix this vulnerability, the code should include a check to ensure that the sum of `size` and `sizeof(gs_malloc_block_t)` does not exceed the maximum value that can be represented by an `uint`.

177901,Overflow," YES, the provided code is vulnerable to an overflow.

The vulnerability arises from the line `temp[start + count] = '0' + (char) r;` in the do-while loop. If the value of `v` is large enough, the calculation of `r` can result in an integer overflow. This overflow can cause `r` to wrap around and produce an incorrect value, leading to incorrect characters being stored in the `temp` array.

Additionally, the code does not check if the `count` variable exceeds the size of the `temp` array (LTOSTR_MAX_SIZE). If `count` becomes larger than LTOSTR_MAX_SIZE, it will result in a buffer overflow when writing to the `temp` array.

These issues can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or even security vulnerabilities if an attacker can control the input value of `v`.","The code contains a Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability lies in the loop that iterates over the `lineBuf` array:

```cpp
for (i = 0; i < xStep; ++i) {

```

In this loop, `xx` is incremented without any bounds checking. This can lead to a buffer overflow if `xx` exceeds the size of `lineBuf`, which is `srcWidth`. The buffer overflow can cause a denial of service (DoS) and possibly execute arbitrary code, as mentioned in the vulnerability summary.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add a bounds check to ensure that `xx` does not exceed the size of `lineBuf`:

```cpp
for (i = 0; i < xStep && xx < srcWidth; ++i) {

177909,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in the code is due to the use of the `gmallocn` function to allocate memory for `pixBuf` without checking if the allocation was successful. If the allocation fails, the code will still proceed to dereference `pixBuf`, leading to undefined behavior, which can cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially allow for arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in CVE-2013-1788, where an invalid memory access can occur due to incorrect handling of memory allocation. In this case, the code should check if `pixBuf` is `NULL` after the allocation attempt and handle the error appropriately, such as by returning an error code or throwing an exception.

Additionally, the code contains a potential integer overflow in the calculation of `d = (255 << 23) / yStep;`. If `yStep` is too large, the result of the division could overflow, leading to an incorrect value for `d` and potentially causing incorrect pixel values to be written to the destination bitmap.

The vulnerability arises from the way the code calculates the length of the input table and the number of groups within it. The code assumes that the input table has a specific structure and that the values at certain offsets (4, 12, and subsequent 12-byte increments) are valid. However, if the input table does not conform to this expected structure, or if the values at these offsets are not as expected, the code may attempt to read beyond the bounds of the input table, leading to an execution code overflow.

In particular, the vulnerability is present in the following lines:

This line assumes that the value pointed to by `ch` is a valid unsigned integer representing the length of the next string. However, if the value is larger than what `ch` can hold (i.e., `nbytes`), it can lead to an out-of-bounds write when accessing the memory beyond the allocated buffer.

This vulnerability is similar to the one described in CVE-2018-14600, where an out-of-bounds write can lead to DoS or remote code execution.

The vulnerability lies in the line:

```c++
length = *ch;
```

In the original vulnerable code, the `length` variable is declared as an `int`, which is a signed integer type. However, in the provided code snippet, the `length` variable is declared as an `unsigned int`. This change in the type of `length` variable does not fix the vulnerability.

The issue is that the `length` variable is used to determine the end of the buffer when copying the strings. If the `length` value is negative due to an integer overflow, the code will still access the buffer beyond its allocated size, leading to an out-of-bounds write. This can result in a denial of service or remote code execution, as mentioned in the CVE-ID CVE-201EE-14600.

To fix this vulnerability, the `length` variable should be declared as an `unsigned int` and the code should be modified to handle the case where the `length` value is negative.

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it handles the `rlen` variable and the subsequent memory allocation for `ch`. The vulnerability arises from the fact that `rlen` is calculated using a right shift operation `(nbytes + 3) >> 2`, which could potentially lead to an incorrect size being allocated for `ch`. This incorrect size could be exploited in a way similar to the CVE-2018-14599 issue, where an attacker could manipulate the server response to cause a buffer overflow or other unintended behavior.

In the original vulnerable code, the issue was with the `req->length` calculation and the subsequent memory allocation for `ch`. The code you provided has a similar pattern where `rlen` is calculated and then used to allocate memory for `ch`. If an attacker can control the length of the response, they might be able to cause an off-by-one error or other issues that could lead to a vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the size calculation for `ch` is correct and that the memory allocation is done safely, taking into account the actual size of the data being read.

The vulnerability lies in the way the function processes the data read from the display server. The function `_XReadPad` is used to read a block of data from the display server into the buffer `ch`. The size of the data read is determined by `nbytes`, which is calculated based on the `rep.length` field of the `xGetFontPathReply` structure.

The issue arises in the loop that unpacks the null-terminated strings from the buffer `ch`. The loop assumes that the length of each string is stored at the beginning of the string, followed by a null-terminator. The loop reads the length of the string, skips the length bytes, and then reads the next length bytes to find the next string.

However, if the server sends a response with a length that is larger than the actual length of the string, the loop will read past the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. This can cause a crash or allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

The provided code snippet is vulnerable due to the potential for an off-by-one error in the loop that processes the extension names. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the following line:

```c
if (ch + length < chend) {
```

This condition checks if the end of the current extension name is before the end of the buffer `ch`. However, if the server response is crafted maliciously to include a length that, when added to the current position `ch`, exactly matches `chend`, the loop will attempt to read past the end of the buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which is a classic example of a vulnerability that can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) or potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-ID CVE-201EEEE-14599, where an off-by-one error in the processing of extension names can lead to a buffer overflow. The code does not properly handle the case where the length of the extension name is exactly equal to the remaining space in the buffer, which can result in reading and writing past the intended buffer boundaries.

The vulnerability arises from the use of a fixed-size buffer `param_buffer[1024]` to store parameters parsed from a string. If the input string contains more than 1023 characters (excluding the null terminator), the code will write past the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. This can result in undefined behavior, including crashing the program or potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is present in the loop where the code copies characters from `curchar` to `param_buffer`. The check `if (param_len >= sizeof(param_buffer))` is intended to prevent buffer overflow, but it is placed after the character has already been copied to the buffer, which means the overflow can occur before the check is made.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the buffer is not overwritten by checking the buffer size before copying each character. Additionally, using safer string manipulation functions or higher-level constructs that handle memory management can help prevent such vulnerabilities.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The provided C++ code for the `move_uploaded_file` function is vulnerable to the same Bypass vulnerability as described in the original PHP code. The vulnerability arises from the handling of file paths that may contain null bytes (`\x00`). The code in question truncates the path upon encountering a null byte, which can allow an attacker to bypass file extension restrictions and potentially create files with unexpected names.

In the provided code snippet, the `zend_parse_parameters` function is used to parse the arguments, and the `zend_hash_exists` function checks if the file path exists in the `rfc1EE_uploaded_files` hash. However, the vulnerability lies in the handling of the `new_path` variable, which is not explicitly checked for null bytes or truncated.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should be updated to properly handle file paths that may contain null bytes.
