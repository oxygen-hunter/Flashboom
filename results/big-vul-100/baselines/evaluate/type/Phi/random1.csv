177767,DoS," YES, the provided code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in the code is due to the lack of proper error handling and memory management. The code does not check the return values of memory allocation functions like `talloc` and `talloc_zero`. If these functions fail to allocate memory, the code should handle the error gracefully instead of proceeding with the assumption that the memory was successfully allocated. This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability if an attacker can craft packets that cause the server to repeatedly fail to allocate memory, eventually exhausting system resources and causing the server to crash or become unresponsive.

In the provided code snippet, the `talloc` and `talloc_zero` functions are used to allocate memory for the `control` and `r` variables. However, there is no check to ensure that these functions return a valid pointer. If they fail to allocate memory, the code will continue to execute, potentially leading to undefined behavior and a DoS condition.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the return values of `talloc` and `talloc_zero` and handle the error appropriately, such as by logging the error and returning a failure status. Additionally, the code should ensure that all allocated memory is properly freed to prevent memory leaks.","The code contains a DoS vulnerability.

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflow in the calculation of `rowSize`. The vulnerability arises from the following lines:

```cpp

rowSize = width;
rowSize = width * 3;
rowSize = width * 4;
rowSize = width * 4;
rowSize += rowPad - 1;

This can result in the allocation of an incorrect amount of memory when calling `gmalloc(rowSize * height)`, which can cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add checks to ensure that the calculated `rowSize` does not exceed the maximum value that can be represented by the data type (e.g., `int`). You can use the `limits` library to obtain the maximum value for the data type and compare it with the calculated `rowSize`.

177809,Bypass," YES

The provided code snippet is vulnerable due to the same Bypass vulnerability as the original code. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly check the available stack space when the device remains the same, which can lead to a stack overflow.

In the code, the `if (required_ops + ref_stack_count(&o_stack) >= ref_stack_max_count(&o_stack))` and `if (required_es + ref_stack_count(&e_stack) >= ref_stack_max_count(&e_stack))` checks are meant to prevent stack overflow by ensuring there is enough stack space available for the operation. However, these checks are only performed when `LockSafetyParams` is true and `samepagedevice` is false, which means that if the device remains the same, the checks may not be executed, leading to a potential stack overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, the checks for available stack space should be performed regardless of the value of `samepagedevice`. This can be achieved by moving the checks outside the `if (LockSafetyParams &&!samepagedevice)` block, ensuring that the checks are always executed when the device remains the same.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

The provided code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to the way it handles the decompression table. Specifically, the vulnerability arises when the `code` variable, which represents a code word from the compressed data, is not found in the `file->tab_prefix` array. In such a case, the code enters the special case for the KwKwK string and sets `code` to `oldcode`. However, if `oldcode` is also not present in the table, the code will enter an infinite loop or potentially cause a heap-based buffer overflow.

The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2011-2895, where the decompression routine does not properly handle code words that are absent from the decompression table. This can lead to an infinite loop or a heap-based buffer overflow, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly handle the case when `code` is not found in the `file->tab_prefix` array, and ensure that the decompression process terminates gracefully without entering an infinite loop or causing a buffer overflow.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The provided code is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow in the `sprintf` function call within the `for` loop. The `sprintf` function is used to format the `pathName` string, which is a fixed-size buffer of 1024 characters. If the `destFileName` combined with the page number (`pageNo`) exceeds this buffer size, it will cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the initial code snippet, where the `sprintf` function is used without proper bounds checking.

177833,DoS Overflow," YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability lies in the `RSA_private_decrypt` function call. The third argument to this function is the buffer where the decrypted data will be stored. In the provided code, this buffer is `password`, which is a character array of size `SPICE_MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH`.

The issue arises when a user provides a password that is longer than `SPICE_MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH`. In this case, the `RSA_private_decrypt` function will write past the end of the `password` buffer, causing a stack-based buffer overflow. This can lead to a denial of service (crash) as the program's execution flow can be disrupted.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the size of the `password` buffer is sufficient to hold the decrypted data. You can also use safer functions like `RSA_private_decrypt_PKCS1_OAEP` which takes care of padding and size checks.","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

The provided C++ code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2019-13638 vulnerability described. The vulnerability in question involves the execution of arbitrary commands through the use of an editor program in a patch file. In the provided code, the editor program is specified as a constant string `EDITOR_PROGRAM`, and it is not constructed from external input or modified by the user.

The code uses the `execl` function to execute the editor program with the specified `outname` as an argument. Since the `outname` is passed as a command-line argument and not constructed from external input, there is no risk of command injection through this mechanism.

However, it is essential to ensure that the `outname` variable is not manipulated or influenced by external input in other parts of the code not shown here. If the `outname` is derived from user input or other untrusted sources, it could potentially introduce vulnerabilities.

In summary, based on the provided code snippet, there is no direct indication of vulnerability to the CVE-2019-13638 issue.

177879,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly validate the `pos` variable before using it as an index to access the `fdctrl->fifo` array. If `pos` is greater than or equal to `FD_SECTOR_LEN`, it will cause an out-of-bounds write, which can lead to a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.

In the code, `pos` is calculated as `fdctrl->data_pos % FD_SECTOR_LEN`. If `fdctrl->data_pos` is greater than or equal to `FD_SECTOR_LEN`, the modulo operation will not prevent `pos` from being out of bounds. This can happen if the `data_pos` is not properly managed or if the `data_len` is set incorrectly.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that `pos` is always within the bounds of the `fdctrl->fifo` array before accessing it. You can add a check to ensure that `pos` is less than `FD_SECTOR_LEN` before using it as an index.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The provided code is vulnerable to a DoS (Denial of Service) overflow because it does not properly check for integer overflow when calculating the `added` variable. This can lead to an integer overflow when the `size` argument is large enough, causing the program to behave unexpectedly or crash.

In the `else` block, the code calculates the `added` variable as follows:

```c++
uint added = size + sizeof(gs_malloc_block_t);
```

If the `size` argument is large enough, the sum of `size` and `sizeof(gs_malloc_block_t)` can exceed the maximum value that an `uint` (unsigned integer) can hold, leading to an integer overflow. This can cause the `added` variable to wrap around to a smaller value, which may result in an incorrect memory allocation or even a crash.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add a check for integer overflow before calculating the `added` variable:

```c++
uint added = size + sizeof(gs_malloc_block_t);
if (added < size) {
    // Integer overflow occurred, handle the error

The provided code snippet is vulnerable due to the way it handles XML parsing. The vulnerability is related to XML External Entities (XXE), which can be exploited to read arbitrary files on the server. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the parser may process external entity references within the XML content.

In the code, the `xmlParseDocument` function is called without any checks for external entities. If the XML content being parsed contains an external entity declaration, it could lead to the aforementioned XXE vulnerability.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should ensure that the XML parser is configured to disallow the processing of external entities. This can be done by setting the `XML_PARSE_DTDLOAD` option to 0, which is already done in the code snippet. However, it is also recommended to set the `XML_PARSE_NOENT` option to 1 to disable the processing of external entities altogether.

Here's an updated version of the code snippet with the additional security measure:

The vulnerability in the given code is due to the potential for integer overflow when calculating the `scaledWidth` and `scaledHeight` values. If the values of `mat[0]`, `mat[1]`, `mat[2]`, and `mat[3]` are large enough, the subtraction operations used to calculate `t0`, `t1`, `scaledWidth`, and `scaledHeight` could result in integer overflow. This overflow can lead to incorrect values for `scaledWidth` and `scaledHeight`, which in turn could cause the `scaleMask` function to process an incorrect region of the image or even result in a crash.

For example, if `mat[0]`, `mat[1]`, `mat[2]`, and `mat[3]` are all large positive values, the subtraction operations could result in negative values for `t0`, `t1`, `scaledWidth`, and `scaledHeight`. This would cause the `scaleMask` function to process an incorrect region of the image or even result in a crash.

The vulnerability arises from the line `length = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );` where `TT_NEXT_ULONG` is assumed to read an unsigned long from the pointer `p`. If the input `table` contains a value that causes `TT_NEXT_ULONG` to read a value larger than what can be stored in an unsigned long, an integer overflow will occur. This can lead to incorrect calculations of the `length` variable, which is then used in the subsequent conditional checks.

For example, if `TT_NEXT_ULONG` reads a value that exceeds the maximum value of an unsigned long (which is typically 2^32 - EEEEEEEE on a 32-bit system), the `length` variable will wrap around to a smaller value, causing the subsequent checks to be incorrect. This can lead to the function processing more data than it should, potentially causing out-of-bounds memory access or other unintended behavior.

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to an integer overflow in the line where it calculates the number of glyphs in the range (`nleft`). The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not check for the possibility of `nleft` exceeding the maximum value that can be stored in an `FT_UShort` (which is typically 16 bits). If `nleft` is too large, it can wrap around to a smaller number, leading to an incorrect number of glyphs being processed. This can cause the program to read beyond the end of the data, potentially leading to a buffer overflow and arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-ID CVE-2EE-946, where an integer overflow can lead to an out-of-bounds write. In this case, the overflow can lead to an out-of-bounds read, which can be exploited in a similar manner to execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should include a check to ensure that `nleft` does not exceed the maximum value that can be safely used in the subsequent loop.

177922,Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided C++ code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `add_param_to_argv` function, specifically in the line:

```cpp
param_buffer[param_len++] = *curchar;
```

This line is inside a loop that iterates over the `parsestart` string. The `param_buffer` array has a fixed size of 1024 bytes. If the input string is longer than 1023 characters (plus the null terminator), the code will write past the end of the `param_buffer` array, causing a buffer overflow.

This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or even arbitrary code execution, depending on the system and the context in which the function is used.

The vulnerability is related to the CVE-ID CVE-2019-11360 and the CWE-ID CWE-119, as mentioned in the question.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2019-11360. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.
Vulnerability summary:
A buffer overflow in iptables-restore in netfilter iptables 1.8.2 allows an attacker to (at least) crash the program or potentially gain code execution via a specially crafted iptables-save file. This is related to add_param_to_argv in xshared.c.

Vulnerability summary:
The move_uploaded_file implementation in ext/standard/basic_functions.c in PHP before 5.4.39, 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 truncates a pathname upon encountering a \x00 character, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended extension restrictions and create files with unexpected names via a crafted second argument.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-7243.
