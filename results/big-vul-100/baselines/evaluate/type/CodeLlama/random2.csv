The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `gnutls_session_get_data` function takes a `size_t` argument `session_data_size` and uses it to determine the size of the buffer to be allocated for the session data. However, the function does not check if the value of `session_data_size` is greater than the actual size of the session data, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

The reason for this vulnerability is that the `total` variable is not properly initialized, which allows an attacker to manipulate the value of `total` and cause the `memcpy` function to write beyond the bounds of the allocated memory. This can lead to a buffer overflow and a crash of the bgpd process.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to send a crafted BGP update with a large length value, which can be done by sending a malicious BGP update message with a large length value in the Attribute Flags octet. The attacker can then cause the `memcpy` function to write beyond the bounds of the allocated memory, leading to a buffer overflow and a crash of the bgpd process.

The recommended fix for this vulnerability is to properly initialize the `total` variable, which can be done by setting it to 0 before the `memcpy` function is called.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `drawMaskedImage` function, which takes a `Stream` object as input and processes it in a way that can lead to a buffer overflow. The function uses the `ImageStream` class to read the input stream, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input stream is maliciously crafted.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `ImageStream` class, which does not perform any bounds checking on the input stream. This means that the function can read beyond the end of the input stream, leading to a buffer overflow. Additionally, the function does not properly validate the input stream, which can lead to other vulnerabilities such as integer overflows or underflows.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a malicious PDF file that contains a crafted `Stream` object with a large size.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `snprintf` function in the `extractPages` function, which takes a format string as an argument. The format string is constructed from the `destFileName` parameter, which is a user-supplied string. If the `destFileName` parameter contains format specifiers, such as `%d`, the `snprintf` function will interpret them as placeholders for arguments to be inserted into the format string.

However, the `extractPages` function does not properly validate the `destFileName` parameter, and it does not properly sanitize the format string before passing it to `snprintf`. This means that an attacker can potentially exploit the vulnerability by providing a malicious `destFileName` parameter that contains format specifiers, such as `%d`, followed by a large number of other characters.

When the `snprintf` function is called with a format string that contains format specifiers, it will attempt to read the corresponding arguments from the stack. If the number of arguments provided does not match the number of format specifiers in the format string, the function will read uninitialized memory, leading to a buffer overflow.

177874,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strcpy` function, which can copy more bytes than the destination buffer can hold. This can lead to an overflow of the buffer, resulting in unpredictable behavior or a crash.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a specially crafted input that is longer than the destination buffer. The `strcpy` function would then copy more bytes than the buffer can hold, leading to an overflow. This can be done by sending a specially crafted input to the `aes_crypt_ecb` function, which would cause the buffer to overflow and result in an exploitable vulnerability.

177875,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to Exec_Code_Overflow. The vulnerability is caused by the use of uninitialized memory in the aesdecode operator. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Ghostscript interpreter.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the aes_crypt_cbc function, which takes a pointer to an uninitialized memory block as an argument. The function then uses this block as a buffer to store the decrypted data, which can lead to a buffer overflow and an execution of arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is related to the CWE-119 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory) vulnerability, which is a type of buffer overflow. The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper input validation and bounds checking in the aesdecode operator.

The recommended solution is to fix the vulnerability by properly initializing the memory block before using it. This can be done by allocating the memory block using the gs_alloc_bytes_immovable function, which allocates memory in immovable memory.

Additionally, the code should also properly validate the input data and ensure that it is within the expected range. This can be done by using the getPrefix function to validate the input data and ensure that it is within the expected range.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177879,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-3456. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly check the bounds of the `fdctrl->fifo` array when accessing its elements. Specifically, the `fdctrl_read_data` function reads data from the `fdctrl->fifo` array without checking whether the index is within the bounds of the array. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input to the `fdctrl_read_data` function, which can cause the program to read data from an unintended location in memory. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control of the system or steal sensitive information.

To fix the vulnerability, the code should properly check the bounds of the `fdctrl->fifo` array when accessing its elements. This can be done by using a bounds-checking library or by implementing a custom bounds-checking mechanism. Additionally, the code should be reviewed for other potential vulnerabilities, such as integer overflows or use-after-free errors.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177880,Bypass,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2018-15908. The CWE-ID is CWE-22.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code allows an attacker to bypass the.tempfile restrictions by providing a malicious PostScript file that contains a file name that matches a permission element in the Permissions dictionary. The code does not properly check the file name against the permission element, which allows an attacker to access files that they should not have access to.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
if (string_match( (const unsigned char*) fname, len,
                      permstr + cwd_len, permlen - cwd_len,
                use_windows_pathsep? &win_filename_params : NULL))
    return 0;           /* success */
```
The `string_match` function is used to check if the file name matches the permission element. However, the function does not properly check the file name against the permission element, which allows an attacker to bypass the.tempfile restrictions.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a malicious PostScript file that contains a file name that matches a permission element in the Permissions dictionary.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

However, the code is not checking the return value of `strsep` to determine if it has reached the end of the list, which could lead to an infinite loop if the list is not properly terminated.

Additionally, the code is not checking the return value of `strncmp` to determine if it has found a match, which could lead to an incorrect result if the list contains multiple entries with the same connector name.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to a DoS attack, but it has other issues that need to be addressed.","The code contains a DoS vulnerability.

177883,,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `string_split` function, which takes a string as input and splits it into an array of strings based on a delimiter. The function does not perform any bounds checking on the input string, which means that it can potentially overflow the buffer if the input string is too large.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could send a specially crafted input string that is larger than the buffer size, causing the program to write beyond the end of the buffer and potentially overflow other areas of memory. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or other security vulnerabilities.

To fix this vulnerability, the `string_split` function should be modified to perform bounds checking on the input string and ensure that it does not exceed the buffer size. Additionally, the program should be designed to handle input strings of varying sizes and not rely on the `string_split` function to perform bounds checking.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

177887,DoS Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-3228. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `gs_heap_alloc_bytes` function takes an `uint` argument `size` and adds it to `sizeof(gs_malloc_block_t)` to determine the total size of the memory block to be allocated. If the `size` argument is large enough, the sum of `size` and `sizeof(gs_malloc_block_t)` can overflow, leading to an allocation of a large amount of memory that cannot be satisfied by the system. This can cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted Postscript (ps) file to the `ps2pdf` command, which triggers the `gs_heap_alloc_bytes` function with a large `size` argument. The attacker can cause the application to allocate a large amount of memory, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

177909,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `memset` function to set the values of the `pixBuf` array to 0. The `memset` function takes a `size_t` argument, which is a 64-bit integer on 64-bit systems. However, the `srcWidth` variable is an `int` type, which is a 32-bit integer on 64-bit systems.

If the `srcWidth` variable is set to a large value, the `memset` function will write beyond the bounds of the `pixBuf` array, causing a buffer overflow. This can lead to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

To fix this vulnerability, the `srcWidth` variable should be cast to a `size_t` type before being passed to the `memset` function. This will ensure that the `memset` function writes the correct number of bytes to the `pixBuf` array.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177912,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro, which reads a 32-bit unsigned integer from a buffer. If the buffer is not properly aligned, or if the integer is too large to fit in 32 bits, the macro can cause an integer overflow, leading to an out-of-bounds read or write. This can potentially execute arbitrary code, leading to a vulnerability.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input to the `tt_cmap12_validate` function, which can cause the integer overflow and execute arbitrary code.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177913,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro, which reads a 32-bit integer from the input buffer without performing any bounds checking. This allows an attacker to provide a maliciously crafted input that overflows the buffer, leading to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a maliciously crafted input that overflows the buffer and causes the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro to read data from an unexpected location in memory. This could potentially lead to the execution of arbitrary code, depending on the context in which the function is called.

It is important to note that this vulnerability is not limited to the given code snippet, but rather it is a general issue with the use of the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro in FreeType. Therefore, it is recommended to use safer alternatives, such as the `FT_Stream_Read` function, to read data from streams.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_READ_USHORT()` function, which reads a 16-bit value from the input stream. If the value is greater than 65535, it will overflow and wrap around to a negative value. This can cause the `glyph_sid` variable to become a negative value, leading to an out-of-bounds write in the `for` loop.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input that causes the `glyph_sid` variable to become a negative value. This can be done by sending a large value for the `offset` parameter, which will cause the `FT_READ_USHORT()` function to read a large value for `glyph_sid`. If the value is negative, it will wrap around to a large positive value, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

To fix the vulnerability, the code should be modified to check for overflows before assigning the value to `glyph_sid`. This can be done by using the `FT_UShort` type instead of `FT_UInt` for","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177918,Exec Code,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `XListExtensions` in ListExt.c interprets a variable as signed instead of unsigned, resulting in an out-of-bounds write (of up to 128 bytes), leading to DoS or remote code execution.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strcpy` function, which copies a string into a buffer without checking the size of the buffer. The `strcpy` function does not perform any bounds checking, and it blindly copies the source string into the destination buffer, without checking if the destination buffer has enough space to hold the source string.

In this case, the `strcpy` function is used to copy the extension names into the `list` array, which is allocated on the stack. The `rep.length` variable specifies the size of the extension names, and it is used to determine the size of the `list` array. However, the `rep.length` variable is interpreted as a signed integer, which can cause an out-of-bounds write if the size of the extension names exceeds the size of the `list` array.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted request to the `XListExtensions` function, which contains a large number of extension names that exceed the size of the `list` array. This will cause the `","The code contains a Exec_Code vulnerability.

177922,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2019-11360. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of a fixed-size buffer (param_buffer) to store the input parameters. If the input parameter is longer than the buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow, leading to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted input parameter that exceeds the buffer size, causing the buffer to overflow and overwrite the return address on the stack. This can lead to the execution of malicious code with the privileges of the application.

The vulnerability can be mitigated by using a dynamic buffer allocation mechanism, such as a std::string, to store the input parameters. Alternatively, the buffer size can be increased to a larger value, but this may not be feasible for all use cases.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
