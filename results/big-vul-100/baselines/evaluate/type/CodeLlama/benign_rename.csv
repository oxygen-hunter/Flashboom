The vulnerability arises from the use of the `cairo_mask` function, which takes a pattern as an argument.

177793,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the code, specifically in the calculation of the `bitmap->x`, `bitmap->y`, `bitmap->w`, and `bitmap->h` variables. If the input values are large enough, these calculations can result in integer overflows, leading to incorrect values being assigned to these variables. This can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `splashRound` function, which is used to round the `xFrac` and `yFrac` variables to integers. However, the `splashRound` function does not check for integer overflows, and if the input values are large enough, the function can return incorrect results, leading to the vulnerability.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large value for the `xFrac` and `yFrac` variables. This can cause the `splashRound` function to return incorrect results, leading to the integer overflows and the vulnerability.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177927,,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The vulnerability is in the `EVP_SealInit` function, which takes a variable number of arguments. If the number of arguments is not correct, it can cause a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `EVP_SealInit` function does not check the number of arguments passed to it. It assumes that the number of arguments is correct, and it does not perform any bounds checking on the arguments. This means that if the number of arguments is not correct, it can cause a buffer overflow, which can lead to a crash of the PHP interpreter.

The CVE-ID for this vulnerability is CVE-2017-11144, and the CWE-ID is CWE-754.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.
