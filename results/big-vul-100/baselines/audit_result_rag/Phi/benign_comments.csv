177743,DoS," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `dir` parameter when it is a directory path. The code does not properly sanitize or validate the input, which can lead to a directory traversal attack. An attacker could potentially supply a specially crafted `dir` string that navigates the file system to access unauthorized directories or files.

For example, an attacker could provide a `dir` string like `../../../../etc/passwd` to attempt to read the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file on a Unix-like system. This could lead to information disclosure and potentially other security issues.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly sanitize and validate the `dir` parameter to ensure it only contains valid characters and does not contain any directory traversal sequences. Additionally, the code should check that the resulting path is within the intended directory and does not escape the intended boundaries.",3464,206,9.725882053375244

177788,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `imgMaskData.lookup` array. The code allocates memory for `n` elements, where `n` is `1 << maskColorMap->getBits()`. This means the size of the allocated memory depends on the number of bits in the color map. If the color map has a large number of bits, the allocated memory size could be very large, leading to a potential integer overflow when calculating the size of the memory allocation.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a color map with a large number of bits, causing an integer overflow and leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly arbitrary code execution.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should check for integer overflow when calculating the size of the memory allocation for `imgMaskData.lookup`. Additionally, the code should validate the input parameters to ensure they are within expected ranges.",3673,203,9.6692214012146
