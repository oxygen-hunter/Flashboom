The vulnerability lies in the way the code handles the parsing of the time string. The code assumes that the time string is always in the correct format and does not perform any validation or error checking on the input. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input time string is longer than expected.

In the original code, the vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not check if the input time string is at least 13 characters long before attempting to parse it. If the input time string is shorter than 13 characters, the code will still attempt to parse it, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

In the modified code, the check for the length of the input time string has been added, which prevents the buffer overflow in the case of a short input time string. However, the vulnerability still exists in the case of a long input time string that exceeds the size of the `strbuf` buffer.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should perform proper input validation and error checking to ensure that the input time string is in the correct format and does not exceed the size of the `strbuf` buffer. Additionally, the code should use safer string manipulation functions, such as `strncpy` and `strncat`, to prevent buffer overflows.",1656,301,12.876962184906006

The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `softmask` pointer. In the first code snippet, the `softmask` pointer is dereferenced without proper null checks before it is used. This can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability if the `softmask` pointer has been freed or is invalid.

In the provided code, the `softmask` pointer is assigned to `save->softmask` and then dereferenced in the `pdf_xobject_bbox` and `pdf_xobject_matrix` functions. If `softmask` is NULL or has been freed, this can lead to a crash or undefined behavior.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add proper null checks before dereferencing the `softmask` pointer. For example:

```cpp
if (softmask) {
    pdf_xobject_bbox(ctx, softmask, &mask_bbox);

The vulnerability lies in the repeated allocation of memory for the `control` variable without checking if the allocation was successful. This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if an attacker sends crafted packets that cause the server to allocate memory without success, eventually exhausting system resources.

In the code, `control` is allocated twice without checking if the allocation was successful:

```cpp

The second allocation of `control` is unnecessary and can be removed. However, the vulnerability still exists because the code does not check the return value of the `talloc` function, which is used for memory allocation. If `talloc` fails to allocate memory, the code should handle the error appropriately instead of silently returning `false`.

To fix the vulnerability, the code should check the return value of `talloc` and handle the error case properly. Additionally, the second allocation",1776,301,12.938759326934814

The provided code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the potential for integer overflow in the following line:

```cpp

This line calculates the number of possible colors based on the number of bits per pixel in the color map. If the value of `colorMap->getBits()` is too large, the resulting value of `n` could overflow, leading to an incorrect number of colors being allocated in memory. This could cause a buffer overflow when accessing the `lookup` array, potentially leading to a DoS attack or even arbitrary code execution.

Additionally, the code does not check for integer overflow in the following loop:

177789,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gmalloc` function to allocate memory for `cairo_data`. If the allocation fails due to insufficient memory, the function will return a null pointer. However, the code does not check for this condition before using the pointer. This can lead to a null pointer dereference when attempting to use `cairo_data` in the `memset` function or when passing it to `cairo_image_surface_create_for_data`.

A null pointer dereference can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service. Additionally, if the attacker can control the input parameters, they might be able to craft a situation where the memory allocation fails, causing the application to crash.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the return value of `gmalloc` and handle the case where the allocation fails. For example:

```cpp
cairo_data = (guchar *) gmalloc (cairo_height * cairo_rowstride);
if (cairo_data == nullptr) {
    // Handle the allocation failure, e.g., by logging an error and returning
    return;

177792,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the calculation of `rowSize` and the subsequent memory allocation using `gmalloc`. The `rowSize` is calculated based on the `width` and the `mode`, and then adjusted by adding `rowPad - 1` and subtracting the remainder of `rowSize` divided by `rowPad`. This could lead to an integer overflow if the resulting `rowSize` is too large to be represented by an `int`.

When `gmalloc` is called with `rowSize * height`, if `rowSize` is too large, it could cause an integer overflow, leading to a smaller-than-expected allocation size. This could result in a buffer overflow when the allocated memory is accessed, potentially causing a denial of service or arbitrary code execution.

Additionally, the code does not check for successful memory allocation after calling `gmalloc`. If `gmalloc` fails to allocate memory and returns a null pointer, the subsequent code that assumes a valid pointer could lead to undefined behavior, which is another potential vulnerability.

The provided code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow. The vulnerability arises from the handling of the `code` variable when it is equal to `CLEAR` and `file->block_compress` is true. In this case, the code resets the `tab_prefix` array to zeros and sets `file->clear_flg` to 1, which indicates that the dictionary is cleared. However, the subsequent call to `getcode(file)` does not properly handle the case where the dictionary is empty or reset. If the dictionary is empty, the `getcode` function may return a code that is not present in the `tab_prefix` and `tab_suffix` arrays, leading to an out-of-bounds access when trying to generate output characters.

Additionally, the code does not check if the `code` variable is within the valid range of the `tab_prefix` and `tab_suffix` arrays before using it as an index. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the `code` variable contains a value that is outside the bounds of the arrays.

The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `value` pointer and the `rc` variable. The `rc` variable is used to allocate memory for `value` and to determine the size of the ACL data to be read. However, the code does not properly check for errors when reading the ACL data from the filesystem.

In the case where `rc > 0`, the code allocates memory for `value` and reads the ACL data into it. If an error occurs during the reading process, the code sets `acl` to `NULL` or `ERR_PTR(rc)`. However, the allocated memory for `value` is not freed in this case, leading to a memory leak.

177865,DoS," YES

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles the '*' and '?' characters during pattern matching. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the incorrect handling of '\0' characters when matching '?' characters.

In the original vulnerable code, when a '*' character is encountered, the code correctly handles the '\0' character by decrementing `patdashes` and `stringdashes`. However, when a '?' character is encountered, the code does not handle the '\0' character correctly. It decrements `stringdashes` if a 'XK_minus' character is found, but it does not handle the case where a '\0' character is encountered after a '?' character.

In the provided code snippet, the handling of '\0' characters for '?' characters seems to be corrected, as it decrements `stringdashes` when a 'XK_sinus' character is found and returns 0 if a '\0' character is encountered. However, the vulnerability still exists because the code does not handle the case where a '\0' character is encountered after a '?' character and before a '*' or '\0' character. This can lead to a buffer over-read, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the code does not check the size of the input array before copying it into the output array. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input array is larger than the output array, which is 16 bytes in size.

In the provided code, the input array is passed as a parameter to the function `aes_crypt_ecb`, and the output array is also passed as a parameter. However, there is no check to ensure that the input array is not larger than 16 bytes. If an attacker provides an input array larger than EE_BLOCK_SIZE (16 bytes), it will cause a buffer overflow when copying the input array to the output array.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should include a check to ensure that the input array is not larger than the output array before copying it. This can be done by adding a conditional statement to check the size of the input array and return an error if it is larger than the output array.

Here's an example of how the code can be modified to include this check:

177879,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow attack. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly validate the `pos` variable before using it as an index to access elements in the `fdctrl->fifo` array.

In the code, `pos` is calculated as `fdctrl->data_pos % FD_SECTOR_LEN` when `FD_MSR_NONDMA` is set in the `msr` register. This modulo operation ensures that `pos` is always within the bounds of the `fifo` array. However, the vulnerability lies in the fact that the `data_pos` variable is incremented after accessing the `fifo` array, and the code does not check if `data_pos` has reached the end of the `fifo` array before incrementing it.

The provided code is vulnerable to a DoS (Denial of Service) overflow. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly check for integer overflow when calculating the `added` variable, which is the sum of `size` and `sizeof(gs_malloc_block_t)`. If `size` is large enough, this sum could overflow the bounds of an `uint` (assuming `uint` is an unsigned integer type), leading to an incorrect value for `added`. This incorrect value could then be used to allocate memory, potentially causing a buffer overflow or other undefined behavior.


The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-ID CVE-2015-3228, where an integer overflow can lead to a denial of service. In the context of the provided code, if the `added` variable overflows, it could result in allocating less memory than requested or even no memory at all, which could cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.


To fix this vulnerability, the code should include a check to ensure that the sum of `size` and `sizeof(gs_malloc_block_t)` does not exceed the maximum value that can be represented by an `uint`. This can be done by comparing the sum against `UINT_MAX` before proceeding with the allocation.",1909,293,12.85500454902649
177891,DoS," YES, the provided code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the same reason as the original vulnerable code.

The vulnerability lies in the way the function processes the data read from the display server. The function `_XReadPad` is used to read a block of data from the display server into the buffer `ch`. The size of the data read is determined by `nbytes`, which is calculated based on the `rep.length` field of the `xGetFontPathReply` structure.

The issue arises in the loop that unpacks the null-terminated strings from the buffer `ch`. The loop assumes that the length of each string is stored at the beginning of the string, followed by a null-terminator. The loop reads the length of the string, skips the length bytes, and then reads the next length bytes to find the next string.

177922,Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided code is vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The vulnerability arises from the use of a fixed-size buffer `param_buffer[1024]` to store parameters parsed from a string. If the input string contains more than 1023 characters (excluding the null terminator), the code will write past the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. This can result in undefined behavior, including crashing the program or potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is present in the loop where the code copies characters from `curchar` to `param_buffer`. The check `if (param_len >= sizeof(param_buffer))` is intended to prevent buffer overflow, but it is placed after the character has already been copied to the buffer, which means the overflow can occur before the check is made.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the buffer is not overwritten by checking the buffer size before copying each character. Additionally, using safer string manipulation functions or higher-level constructs that handle memory management can help prevent such vulnerabilities.",1921,240,10.626683950424194
177923,Bypass," YES

The provided C++ code for the `move_uploaded_file` function is vulnerable to the same Bypass vulnerability as described in the original PHP code. The vulnerability arises from the handling of file paths that may contain null bytes (`\x00`). The code in question truncates the path upon encountering a null byte, which can allow an attacker to bypass file extension restrictions and potentially create files with unexpected names.

In the provided code snippet, the `zend_parse_parameters` function is used to parse the arguments, and the `zend_hash_exists` function checks if the file path exists in the `rfc1EE_uploaded_files` hash. However, the vulnerability lies in the handling of the `new_path` variable, which is not explicitly checked for null bytes or truncated.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should be updated to properly handle file paths that may contain null bytes. This can be done by using functions that are designed to handle such paths or by implementing additional checks to ensure that the `new_path` does not contain null bytes before proceeding with the file operation.",1523,248,10.673082113265991

The provided C++ code does not appear to be vulnerable to the same issue as the PHP code. The PHP code has a vulnerability due to not checking the return value of the OpenSSL sealing function, which could lead to a crash of the PHP interpreter. The C++ code, on the other hand, does check the return values of the OpenSSL functions and handles errors appropriately.",3655,84,4.500006198883057
