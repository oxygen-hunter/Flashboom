The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during the creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC.

177740,DoS Exec Code Overflow Mem. Corr.," YES, the provided code is still vulnerable to DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow_Mem._Corr. The vulnerability lies in the way the function parses the ASN1_UTCTIME structure. The function assumes that the input string is always in the correct format and does not perform any validation on the input data. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is not properly formatted, which can result in a denial of service or arbitrary code execution.

In the provided code, the function still uses the `atoi` function to parse the time components from the input string without checking if the string is null-terminated or if it contains valid numeric characters. If the input string is not properly formatted, this can lead to undefined behavior, such as reading past the end of the string, which can cause a buffer overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, the function should perform proper input validation and use safer functions like `strtol` or `sscanf` with appropriate format specifiers to parse the time components from the input string. Additionally, the function should check if the input string is null-terminated and handle any potential errors gracefully.",1568,247,10.650877475738525

177743,DoS," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in the code is due to an off-by-one error in the `phar_parse_zipfile` function in `ext/phar/zip.c` in PHP before version 5.5.30 and 5.6.x before version 5.6.14. This error can lead to a denial of service (DoS) by causing a crash when a malicious.zip PHAR archive is included with a filename that contains the ""/"" character.

The issue arises when the code checks for the presence of a ""/"" character in the filename. If the filename contains a ""/"", the code assumes it is a subdirectory and processes it accordingly. However, if the filename is exactly ""/"", the code does not handle it correctly, leading to an uninitialized pointer dereference and application crash.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should be updated to handle the case when the filename is exactly ""/"" and ensure that the pointer dereference is properly initialized.",3445,225,10.555153608322144

However, in the `benign_begin_softmask` function, there is no such check before using `mask_colorspace` in the `fz_begin_mask` function.

If `softmask` is `NULL`, `mask_colorspace` will also be `NULL`, and using it in `fz_begin_mask` without checking could lead to a null pointer dereference, which is a common vulnerability that can cause a denial of service (DoS) or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if the underlying library has a vulnerability that can be exploited in this scenario.

The vulnerability in the benign_sparse_dump_region function is similar to the one in the sparse_dump_region function. The issue arises when handling file shrinkage during read access. If a file is supposed to be archived by a different user's process (e.g., a system backup running as root), a local user can cause a denial of service by modifying the file.

In the benign_sparse_dump_region function, the code does not properly handle the case when the file size has been reduced during the read operation. The loop that reads the file blocks does not account for the possibility that the file size has changed, which can lead to an infinite read loop if the file size is reduced while being read.

The line `bytes_left -= bytes_read;` assumes that the number of bytes read from the file is always less than or equal to the remaining bytes left to read. However, if the file size has been reduced during the read operation, this assumption may not hold true, and the loop can become an infinite loop, causing a denial of service.

To fix this vulnerability, the benign_sparse_dump_region function should properly handle the case when the file size has been reduced during the read operation, and ensure that the loop does not become an infinite loop.",2157,301,13.470428705215454

If the pointer points to itself or creates a long chain of valid pointers, it can lead to infinite recursion or stack exhaustion, respectively.

This is the same vulnerability as described in CVE-2018-20103. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly validate the decompressed pointer before using it, which can lead to a buffer overflow or other unexpected behavior.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the decompressed pointer is within the bounds of the buffer and that it does not point to itself or create a long chain of valid pointers.

The provided code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) or possibly arbitrary code execution due to the way it handles memory allocation and deallocation for the `imgData.lookup` array. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `imgData.lookup` array is allocated with `gmalloc` without checking if the allocation was successful. If the allocation fails, the subsequent code that accesses `imgData.lookup` can lead to undefined behavior, potentially causing a DoS or arbitrary code execution.

In the code, the `imgData.lookup` array is allocated as follows:

```c++

This can cause a denial of service (application crash) or potentially allow arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the input that leads to a failed memory allocation.

Additionally, the code does not free the allocated memory for the lookup tables in all execution paths, which can lead to a memory leak.

The issue lies in the following lines of code:

```

In this line, the length of the segment header is updated with the sum of the current segment's length and the next segment's length. However, this can lead to an incorrect AS_PATH size calculation when the next segment's data is packed into the current segment.

The vulnerability occurs when the length of the next segment is greater than the remaining space in the current segment. In this case, the next segment's data is packed into the current segment, and the length of the segment header is updated with the sum of the current and next segment lengths.

The reason is that the function does not address the integer overflow issue present in the original `gs_heap_alloc_bytes` function. The vulnerability arises from the calculation of the `added` variable, which is the sum of the requested `size` and the size of the `gs_malloc_block_t` structure. If the sum exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by an `uint` (which is typically 4 bytes), an integer overflow will occur, leading to an incorrect value for `added`.

This incorrect value can then be used to allocate memory, potentially causing an out-of-bounds read or write, which can lead to a denial of service (crash) as demonstrated by the CVE-ID CVE-2EE-3228.

uint added = size + sizeof(gs_malloc_block_t);
if (added > (uint)mmem->limit) {
    set_msg(""exceeded limit"");
} else {

177891,DoS," YES, the provided code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the same reason as the original vulnerable code. The vulnerability arises when the RSA PSS signature lacks a mask generation function (MGF) parameter. In the code, if the `pss->maskGenAlgorithm` is not present or the `param` type is not `V_ASN1_SEQUENCE`, the code does not handle this case properly, which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference and potentially crash the application.

In the provided code snippet, the check for `pss->maskGenAlgorithm` is present, but there is no explicit check to ensure that the `param` is not NULL before dereferencing it. If the `param` is NULL, dereferencing it will lead to a NULL pointer dereference, which is a common cause of crashes in C/C++ programs.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should include an additional check to ensure that `param` is not NULL before attempting to access its members. Here's an example of how to fix the code:

if (pss->maskGenAlgorithm) {
    ASN1_TYPE *param = pss->maskGenAlgorithm->parameter;

177911,Exec Code Overflow," YES, the code is vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The vulnerability in the provided code is due to the lack of proper bounds checking when reading the glyph indices. The code reads glyph indices using `TT_NEXT_USHORT(p)` without checking if the pointer `p` is within the bounds of the `table` array. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the `table` array is smaller than expected, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

In the benign_tt_cmap10_validate function, the same vulnerability exists as in the original tt_cmap10_validate function. The code does not perform any additional bounds checking on the glyph indices, making it susceptible to the same Exec Code Overflow vulnerability.",814,169,7.244799852371216
177912,Exec Code Overflow," YES, the code is vulnerable to Exec_Code_Overflow.

The vulnerability arises from the way the code calculates the length of the input table and the number of groups within it. The code assumes that the input table has a specific structure and that the values at certain offsets (4, 12, and subsequent offsets for each group) are valid. However, if the input table does not conform to this expected structure, or if the values at these offsets are unexpectedly large, it can lead to integer overflows when calculating the length and the number of groups.

In the provided code snippet, the vulnerability is present in the following lines:

```cpp
length = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
p          = table + 12;
p          = table + 12;
num_groups = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
```

If the value at the offset `table + 4` is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in an `FT_ULong`, it will cause an integer overflow when calculating the length. Similarly, if the value at the offset `table + 12` is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in an `FT_ULong`, it will cause an integer overflow when calculating the number of groups.

These integer overflows can lead to incorrect calculations of the",1062,301,12.781357288360596
177913,Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided code is vulnerable to an integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the following line:

```cpp
if ( start_id + end - start >= TT_VALID_GLYPH_COUNT( valid ) )
```

In this line, the code is adding `start_id`, `end`, and subtracting `start` to check if the sum is greater than or equal to `TT_VALID_GLYPH_COUNT(valid)`. If the sum is greater, it returns `FT_INVALID_GLYPH_ID`.

The issue arises when the values of `start_id`, `end`, and `start` are large enough that their sum exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in an `FT_UInt32` variable. This can cause an integer overflow, leading to incorrect results and potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate the program's behavior.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the sum of `start_id`, `end`, and `start` does not exceed the maximum value that can be stored in an `FT_UInt32` variable. You can do this by adding proper checks and handling for potential overflows before performing the addition and subtraction operations.",2100,271,12.195610284805298

177918,Exec Code," YES, the given code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the line where the length of the extension is read from the buffer:

```c
length = *ch;
```

In the original vulnerable code, the length is stored as a signed integer, which can lead to an out-of-bounds write when the length is negative. However, in the provided benign_XListExtensions function, the length is read as an unsigned integer, which should prevent the specific vulnerability mentioned in the CVE-ID CVE-2018-14600.

However, the code still has a potential vulnerability due to the way it handles the buffer read:

```c
_XReadPad(dpy, ch, rlen);
```

This function reads `rlen` bytes from the display into the buffer `ch`. If the actual number of extensions is less than `rlen`, the loop that unpacks the extensions will continue to read past the end of the actual data, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the buffer read does not exceed the actual number of extensions. This can be done by checking the number of extensions before reading the buffer and adjusting the `rlen` value accordingly.",1408,279,11.949508666992188
177919,nan," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `chend` pointer and the subsequent memory access. The `chend` pointer is calculated as `ch + (rlen + 1)`, which is the end of the buffer allocated for the font names. However, the code does not check if `chend` is within the bounds of the allocated memory before using it.

In the loop that processes the font names, the code checks if `ch + length < chend` before proceeding. If this condition is true, it means that there is still space in the buffer to read the next font name. However, if the server sends a response with more font names than expected, the loop could continue reading past the end of the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

This buffer overflow can lead to a denial of service (DoS) as it may corrupt the memory and cause the program to crash. In a worst-case scenario, if an attacker can control the input and the server response, they could potentially execute arbitrary code, leading to a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that it does not read past the end of the allocated buffer. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that `chend` is within the bounds of the allocated memory before using it. Additionally, the code should also handle",1953,301,13.315267562866211

The provided `benign_XGetHtmlPath` function is vulnerable to the same type of off-by-one error as the original `XGetFontPath` function. The vulnerability arises from the way the function processes the length of the font paths.

In the loop that unpacks the font paths into null-terminated strings, the function reads the length of the next path and then skips over it to read the next length. However, if the server response is maliciously crafted, it could provide a length that is equal to the remaining buffer size (`ch + length < chend`). In this case, the function would set `flist[i]` to `ch+1` and then increment `ch` by `length + 1`, which would cause it to read past the end of the buffer. This could lead to a buffer overflow, potentially causing a denial of service or other unspecified impacts.

To fix this vulnerability, the function should check that the length of the next path is less than the remaining buffer size before reading it. This can be done by adding a condition to the loop:

```cpp
for (i = 0; i < rep.nPaths; i++) {
    if (ch + length < chend) {
        flist[i] = ch+1;  /* skip over length */

177921,nan," YES, the benign_XListExtensions function is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the same line of code as the original function:

```c
if (ch + length < chend) {
```

This line is responsible for checking if the end of the buffer has been reached before copying the next extension length. However, the condition is off-by-one, which means it may not correctly detect when the end of the buffer has been reached. This can lead to a buffer overflow, where data is written past the end of the allocated memory, potentially causing a denial of service (DoS) or other unspecified impacts.

The vulnerability is the same as the one in the original function, and it is still present in the benign_XListExtensions function.",1429,169,7.387531995773315
177922,Exec Code Overflow," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in the `benign_add_param_to_argv` function is similar to the one in the `add_param_to_argv` function. The issue lies in the way the function handles the buffer `param_buffer`. The buffer is statically allocated with a fixed size of 1024 bytes. If the input string `parsestart` is longer than this size, the function will continue to write past the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

This can result in overwriting adjacent memory, corrupting data, or even allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is present because the function does not properly check the length of the input string before copying it into the buffer.

To fix this vulnerability, the function should ensure that the input string is not longer than the buffer size before copying it. Additionally, using safer string manipulation functions like `strncpy` or `snprintf` can help prevent buffer overflows.",1833,222,9.685409545898438
