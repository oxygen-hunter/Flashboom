The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `gnutls_session_get_data` function takes a `size_t` parameter `session_data_size` and uses it to determine the size of the buffer to be allocated for the session data. However, the function does not check if the value of `session_data_size` is greater than the actual size of the session data, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a large value for `session_data_size` in the `gnutls_session_get_data` function, causing the function to allocate a buffer of the specified size and then copying the session data into it. If the value of `session_data_size` is greater than the actual size of the session data, the function will write beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `phar_parse_zipfile` function does not properly check the length of the `str_key` string before using it as an index into the `manifest` hash table. This allows an attacker to include the `/` filename in the manifest, which can cause the application to crash or become unresponsive.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to create a specially crafted.zip file that includes the `/` filename in the manifest. This can be done by using a tool such as `zip` or `7z` to create a.zip file with the `/` filename in the manifest. Once the.zip file is created, it can be used to exploit the vulnerability by passing it to the `phar_parse_zipfile` function.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gmallocn` function, which allocates memory for an array of `n` elements of size `m`. In this case, the `n` parameter is set to `1 << colorMap->getBits()`, which can be a very large number. If the `colorMap->getBits()` function returns a value that is close to the maximum value of an integer, then the `n` parameter can overflow and cause a buffer overflow.

The buffer overflow can lead to an integer overflow in the `imgData.lookup` array, which can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code. This is because the `imgData.lookup` array is used to store the color values for the image, and the color values are stored as integers. If the color values are too large, they can overflow the integer and cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `getRGBLine` function, which takes an integer `width` as an argument. The function then uses this value to calculate the size of the buffer it allocates, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the `width` value is not properly validated.

The code then proceeds to copy the image data into the buffer, which can potentially overflow the buffer if the `width` value is too large. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, potentially allowing an attacker to cause a denial of service or execute malicious code.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `width` value should be properly validated to ensure it is within a reasonable range. Additionally, the code should be updated to use safer functions for handling image data, such as `strncpy` or `memcpy_s`.",2151,241,8.652760744094849

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `getRGBLine` function, which can cause an integer overflow if the `width` parameter is large. The `getRGBLine` function is used to extract the RGB values of a pixel and store them in a buffer. The buffer is then used to create a cairo surface, which is then used to draw the image.

The vulnerability occurs when the `width` parameter is large enough to cause an integer overflow. This can happen if the `width` parameter is a large number, such as 2^31-1. When the `getRGBLine` function is called with this large `width` parameter, it will attempt to access memory locations beyond the end of the buffer, which can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to craft a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large image with a large `width` parameter. The attacker could then send this PDF file to the vulnerable application, which would cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

The pattern is created from the `maskImage` surface, which is created from the `maskBuffer` buffer. The `maskBuffer` buffer is created by copying the `maskImgStr` stream into a new buffer, and the `maskImgStr` stream is created by reading the `maskStr` stream.

The `maskStr` stream is a user-supplied stream, and it can contain arbitrary data. If the `maskStr` stream contains a large amount of data, it can cause a buffer overflow when it is copied into the `maskBuffer` buffer. This can lead to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a malicious PDF file that contains a large amount of data in the `maskStr` stream. When the PDF file is processed by the `drawSoftMaskedImage` function, the buffer overflow can occur, leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

However, the `gmalloc` function does not check for this condition and simply returns the null pointer. This can lead to a null pointer dereference when the allocated memory is used.

Furthermore, the `gmalloc` function does not check the size of the allocated memory block, which can lead to buffer overflows if the block is too small.

The code also uses the `colToByte` function, which converts a color value to a byte value. However, this function does not check the range of the color value and simply returns the value. This can lead to buffer overflows if the color value is too large.

In addition, the code uses the `get` function to access the `lookup` array. However, this function does not check the bounds of the array and simply returns the value at the specified index. This can lead to buffer overflows if the index is too large.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `flip()` function, which uses a uniform_int_distribution to generate a random number between 0 and `n_ - 1`. However, the `n_` variable is decremented before the distribution is created, so the maximum value of `n_` is `n_ - 1`. This means that the distribution will always generate the same value, which is `n_ - 1`.

This can lead to a buffer overflow when the `flip()` function is called repeatedly, as the `lookup_` array is not properly initialized. The `lookup_` array is used to store the values of the `n_` variable, but it is not properly initialized, so it contains uninitialized values. When the `flip()` function is called, it uses the uninitialized values in the `lookup_` array to calculate the index of the array, which leads to a buffer overflow.

If the value of width or height is greater than the maximum value that can be represented by an integer, the calculation will result in an integer overflow, leading to incorrect values for cairo_width and cairo_height. This can cause the cairo_data buffer to be allocated with an incorrect size, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially executing arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the ceil function, which rounds up the result of the multiplication of width and scale to the nearest integer.

177913,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code checks the length of the input buffer and the number of groups in the cmap table, and then iterates over the groups to check that they are in increasing order. It also checks that the start and end values of each group are within the valid range, and that the start_id value is less than the number of valid glyphs.

There is no obvious integer overflow vulnerability in the code, and it does not appear to be vulnerable to any other type of attack.",2190,120,4.513456583023071
177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` and `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macros, which are used to read data from the input stream. However, the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` macro does not perform any bounds checking on the input data, which can lead to an integer overflow if the input data is too large. This can cause the program to read data from an unexpected location in memory, leading to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input that causes the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` macro to read data from an unexpected location in memory, leading to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.",1740,215,7.704996347427368

177922,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2019-11360. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `add_param_to_argv` function does not perform proper bounds checking on the `param_buffer` array, which can lead to buffer overflows. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted input that exceeds the size of the `param_buffer` array, causing the program to write beyond the allocated memory and execute arbitrary code.

This vulnerability is related to the `add_argv` function, which is called after the `param_buffer` array has been filled with user input. The `add_argv` function does not perform proper bounds checking on the `param_buffer` array, which can lead to buffer overflows. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted input that exceeds the size of the `param_buffer` array, causing the program to write beyond the allocated memory and execute arbitrary code.

This vulnerability is similar to the one described in CVE-2019-11360, which affects the `iptables-restore` command in the netfilter iptables package. The vulnerability is",1922,301,10.616485834121704
177923,Bypass,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability. The code checks the input parameters for null or empty values, and it also checks if the file exists before moving it. Additionally, it checks if the new path is within the open_basedir, if it is set.

Therefore, the code does not have any vulnerabilities related to bypassing security checks.",1524,84,3.202003240585327
177926,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code does not contain any integer overflows or underflows, and the input data is properly validated and sanitized. The function also properly checks for null pointers before dereferencing them, which helps prevent crashes or unpredictable behavior.

Therefore, there is no Exec Code Overflow vulnerability in the given code.",1497,87,3.2899532318115234
177927,nan,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function takes a string as input and copies it into a buffer without checking the size of the input. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is larger than the buffer. The vulnerability is in the line `buf = emalloc(data_len + EVP_CIPHER_CTX_block_size(ctx));`. The `data_len` variable is not properly validated, and the `EVP_CIPHER_CTX_block_size(ctx)` function returns the block size of the cipher, which can be larger than the input string. This can cause the buffer to overflow and potentially lead to a crash of the PHP interpreter.",3656,157,6.013930320739746
