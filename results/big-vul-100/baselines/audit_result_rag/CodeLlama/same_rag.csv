In Artifex Ghostscript before 9.24, attackers able to supply crafted PostScript files could use a type confusion in the setcolor function to crash the interpreter or possibly have unspecified other impact.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `float_params` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the number of operands is greater than the size of the `cc.paint.values` array. The `float_params` function does not perform any bounds checking on the number of operands, and it assumes that the number of operands is less than or equal to the size of the array. However, the `cc.paint.values` array is only allocated to hold `n_numeric_comps` elements, which is a smaller number than the number of operands. If the number of operands is greater than `n_numeric_comps`, the `float_params` function will write to memory outside of the allocated array, causing a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly check the bounds of the `fdctrl->fifo` array when accessing it. Specifically, the `fdctrl->fifo[pos]` statement can cause a buffer overflow if the `pos` variable is greater than or equal to the size of the `fdctrl->fifo` array. This can lead to an out-of-bounds write and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted command to the FDC, which can cause the `fdctrl->fifo` array to be overwritten with malicious data. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) or potentially execute arbitrary code.

To fix the vulnerability, the code should properly check the bounds of the `fdctrl->fifo` array before accessing it.

177911,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to Exec_Code_Overflow. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro, which reads a 32-bit value from the input buffer without performing any bounds checking. If the input buffer is not properly initialized or if the input data is malicious, it can cause an integer overflow that leads to an out-of-bounds read, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.",813,135,5.0024402141571045
177912,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to Exec_Code_Overflow. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly check the length of the input buffer, which can lead to integer overflows and out-of-bounds accesses. Specifically, the `length` variable is calculated using the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro, which can overflow if the input buffer is too large. Additionally, the `num_groups` variable is also calculated using the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro, which can also overflow if the input buffer is too large.

Furthermore, the code does not properly check the values of `start`, `end`, and `start_id` before using them in calculations. This can lead to out-of-bounds accesses and other vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to Exec_Code_Overflow, and it is recommended to fix the vulnerability by properly checking the length of the input buffer and the values of `start`, `end`, and `start_id` before using them in calculations.",1061,266,9.753041505813599
177913,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro, which relies on the assumption that the input buffer is large enough to hold the next 32-bit value. However, the code does not perform any bounds checking on the input buffer, which allows an attacker to provide a specially crafted input that exceeds the buffer size, leading to an integer overflow and a buffer overflow. This can result in arbitrary code execution.",2099,150,6.30249547958374
177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to Exec_Code_Overflow. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_READ_USHORT()` function, which can cause an integer overflow if the value read from the stream exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a `FT_UShort` variable. This can happen if the `offset` parameter is set to a value that is greater than the maximum value that can be stored in a `FT_UShort` variable, which is 65535.

In the code, the `offset` parameter is used to determine whether to parse the charset table or not. If the `offset` parameter is greater than 2, the code will parse the charset table. However, if the `offset` parameter is set to a value that is greater than the maximum value that can be stored in a `FT_UShort` variable, the code will attempt to read the first glyph sid of the range, which can cause an integer overflow. This can lead to an exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability.

Therefore, it is recommended to fix this vulnerability by ensuring that the `offset` parameter is not set to a value that exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a `",1649,301,11.053682327270508
177917,Exec Code,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to Exec_Code. The CVE-ID is CVE-2018-14600. The CWE-ID is CWE-787.

177919,nan,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function XListFonts in ListExt.c is vulnerable to an off-by-one error caused by malicious server responses, leading to DoS or possibly unspecified other impact.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not properly check the length of the response from the server, and instead relies on the server to send a null-terminated string. However, the server may send a response that is one byte longer than expected, causing the function to read past the end of the buffer and overwrite the return address on the stack. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the application, resulting in a buffer overflow attack.",1951,158,6.488799095153809

177922,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow. The CVE-ID is CVE-2019-11360. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of a fixed-size buffer (param_buffer) to store the parameter being parsed. If the parameter is longer than the buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow, leading to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted iptables-save file that contains a long parameter that exceeds the buffer size. When the parameter is parsed, it can overwrite the return address on the stack, allowing an attacker to redirect the program's control flow to a malicious location. This can lead to arbitrary code execution or a crash.

The vulnerability is fixed in later versions of iptables, so it is recommended to upgrade to a version that includes the fix.",1831,209,8.43354082107544

The vulnerability is in the `EVP_SealUpdate` function, which takes a `data` parameter of type `unsigned char *` and a `data_len` parameter of type `size_t`. The `data_len` parameter is not properly validated, which allows an attacker to provide a large value for `data_len` that exceeds the size of the `buf` array, leading to a buffer overflow. This can cause the program to write data to memory outside of the allocated buffer, potentially leading to a crash or other security vulnerability.",3565,135,5.979404449462891
