The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are required to set certain bits in the userAccountControl attribute. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended access restrictions and create machine accounts with the desired bits set.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC. The attacker can then use the vulnerability to create machine accounts with the desired bits set, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or system resources.",2241,252,9.108909606933594

The code is using the `mktime` function to convert the `ASN1_UTCTIME` structure to a `time_t` value, which is a POSIX time value. The `mktime` function takes a `struct tm` structure as input, which contains the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second fields. The code is using the `atoi` function to convert the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second fields to integers, and then using the `memset` function to set the other fields to zero.

The vulnerability occurs when the `ASN1_UTCTIME` structure contains a year value that is less than 68, which is a valid year value. However, the code is not properly handling this case, and is instead setting the year value to 100, which is an invalid year value. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other security vulnerability.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow or other security vulnerability.",1710,255,9.08517336845398

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `gnutls_session_get_data` function does not perform any bounds checking on the `session_data` parameter, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the buffer is not properly validated. The function takes a `size_t` parameter `session_data_size` that is used to determine the size of the buffer, but it does not check if the value is greater than the actual size of the buffer. This can cause the function to write data beyond the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a large `session_data_size` value, which can cause the function to write data beyond the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability, as the application may crash or behave unexpectedly.",983,244,8.620640993118286

The function takes a `session` parameter, which is a pointer to a `gnutls_session_t` structure, and a `session_data` parameter, which is a pointer to a buffer where the data will be stored. The function also takes a `session_data_size` parameter, which is a pointer to a size_t variable that will be set to the size of the data that was stored in the buffer.

The code is checking if the size of the data that was stored in the buffer is greater than the size of the buffer, and if so, it is returning an error code. This is a valid check, as it prevents the function from writing more data to the buffer than it can hold.

However, the code is not checking if the buffer is large enough to hold the data that was stored in the buffer. This could lead to a buffer overflow, as the function is not checking if the buffer is large enough to hold the data.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to a DoS Overflow, as it is not properly checking the size of the buffer.",953,293,10.241858720779419

The code checks if the received attribute is a well-known attribute or not, and if it is not, it returns immediately. It also checks if the attribute is a transitive attribute or not, and if it is not, it returns immediately. Therefore, the code does not allow any malicious input to be processed, and it does not have any vulnerabilities related to buffer overflow or use-after-free.

The code also checks if the attribute is a recognized transitive attribute, and if it is not, it sets the Partial bit in the Attribute Flags octet to 1. However, it does not check if the Partial bit is already set to 1 by some previous AS, and it does not reset the Partial bit to 0 by the current AS. Therefore, the code does not have any vulnerabilities related to the Partial bit.

The code also stores the received attribute to the end of the attr->transit vector. However, it does not check if the attr->transit vector is already full, and it does not remove any elements from the vector. Therefore, the code does not have any vulnerabilities related to memory leaks or buffer overflows.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `fz_try` and `fz_catch` macros in the code. These macros are used to handle exceptions, but they do not properly check the type of exception that is thrown. As a result, if an exception of type `FZ_ERROR_TRYLATER` is thrown, it is not properly caught and handled, leading to a potential denial of service.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could craft a malicious PDF file that contains a large number of `FZ_ERROR_TRYLATER` exceptions, causing the code to repeatedly throw and catch the same exception. This could lead to a stack overflow and a potential denial of service.

It is important to note that this vulnerability is not present in the latest version of MuPDF, which has been fixed. Therefore, it is recommended to upgrade to the latest version to mitigate this vulnerability.",1831,263,9.403598546981812

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `asn1_push_tag` and `asn1_pop_tag` functions, which do not check the return value to ensure successful ASN.1 memory allocation. This can lead to a denial of service (memory consumption and daemon crash) via crafted packets.

The vulnerability is related to the use of the `asn1_push_tag` function, which pushes a new ASN.1 tag onto the stack. If the function fails to allocate memory for the new tag, it does not return an error code, and the application continues to execute with a corrupted ASN.1 stack. This can lead to a variety of issues, including memory leaks, buffer overflows, and other security vulnerabilities.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted packet that causes the `asn1_push_tag` function to fail, leading to a denial of service. This can be done by sending a packet that causes the function to allocate a large amount of memory, which may cause the application to crash or become unresponsive.

The `talloc` library is designed to handle memory allocation failures gracefully, and it will return a null pointer if the allocation fails. The code checks for null pointers before using the allocated memory, so it is not vulnerable to a DoS attack.

Furthermore, the code is using the `asn1_load` function to load the ASN.1 data into the `data` variable. The `asn1_load` function is designed to handle ASN.1 data with a maximum size of 2^32-1 bytes. If the ASN.1 data is larger than this size, the `asn1_load` function will return an error. The code checks for errors before using the loaded data, so it is not vulnerable to a DoS attack.

In summary, the code is not vulnerable to a DoS attack because it uses the `talloc` library and the `asn1_load` function to handle memory allocation and ASN.1 data loading, and it checks for errors before using the loaded data.",1830,271,9.65298318862915

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `cairo_mask` function, which takes a pattern as an argument. The pattern is created from the `maskImage` surface, which is created from the `maskBuffer` buffer. The `maskBuffer` buffer is created by copying the `maskImgStr` stream into a new buffer, and the `maskImgStr` stream is created from the `maskStr` stream.

The `maskStr` stream is a user-supplied stream, and it can contain arbitrary data. If the `maskStr` stream contains a large amount of data, it can cause a buffer overflow when it is copied into the `maskBuffer` buffer. This can lead to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

Vulnerability summary:
In Artifex Ghostscript before 9.24, attackers able to supply crafted PostScript files could use a type confusion in the setcolor function to crash the interpreter or possibly have unspecified other impact.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `float_params` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the number of operands is greater than the size of the `cc.paint.values` array. The `float_params` function does not perform any bounds checking on the number of operands, and it assumes that the number of operands is less than or equal to the size of the array. However, the `cc.paint.values` array is only allocated to hold `n_numeric_comps` elements, which is a variable that is set based on the number of components in the color space. If the number of operands is greater than `n_numeric_comps`, the `float_params` function will write to memory outside of the array, causing a buffer overflow. This can lead to a crash or other unspecified behavior.

177874,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function takes an input array of integers and returns the number of triplets in the array. The function uses a hash table to keep track of the number of times each prefix appears in the array. The hash table is implemented using an unordered_map, which is a type of hash table that uses a hash function to map keys to indices in the table.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the hash function used by the unordered_map is not properly implemented. The hash function is defined as follows:
```
hash(key) = key % table_size
```
This hash function is not collision-free, meaning that there are multiple keys that hash to the same index in the table. This can lead to a buffer overflow attack, as the function may attempt to access memory outside of the allocated array bounds.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can provide an input array with a large number of elements, causing the hash table to overflow and leading to a buffer overflow attack. The attacker can then manipulate the hash table to access memory outside of the allocated array bounds, leading to arbitrary code execution.

Therefore, it is recommended to use a collision-free hash function, such as a cryptographic hash function, to mitigate this vulnerability.",3387,284,10.335490703582764

However, the function does not perform any bounds checking on the filename, which means that it can potentially read beyond the end of the buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the filename is not properly validated, and the function does not check whether the filename is a valid file path. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a filename that is longer than the maximum allowed length, which can cause the function to read beyond the end of the buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the function should perform proper bounds checking on the filename, and ensure that the filename is a valid file path. This can be done by using the `strlen` function to determine the length of the filename, and then checking whether the filename is within the allowed range.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashDist` function, which calculates the distance between two points. The function uses the `sqrt` function to calculate the distance, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the distance is too large. The buffer overflow can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input that causes the `splashDist` function to calculate a large distance between two points. This can be done by providing a large value for one of the points, which will cause the `sqrt` function to overflow. Once the overflow occurs, the program will crash or execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability can be mitigated by using a safe version of the `sqrt` function, such as the `sqrtl` function, which is available in the C standard library. Alternatively, the `splashDist` function can be modified to use a safe version of the `sqrt` function.",2759,267,9.66303825378418

The vulnerability is caused by the line `length = *ch;`, where `length` is declared as an `int` variable. However, the value of `length` is obtained from the input buffer, which is not properly validated. If the input buffer contains a negative value, the `length` variable will be assigned a negative value, which will cause the program to write to a location in memory that is outside the bounds of the allocated buffer.
