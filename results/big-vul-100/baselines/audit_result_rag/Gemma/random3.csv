The CVE-ID is CVE-2019-13638. The CWE-ID is CWE-78.
Vulnerability summary:
GNU patch through 2.7.6 is vulnerable to OS shell command injection that can be exploited by opening a crafted patch file that contains an ed style diff payload with shell metacharacters. The ed editor does not need to be present on the vulnerable system. This is different from CVE-2018-1000156. 
",2427,119,7.076289415359497
177857,nan,"YES
The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. 

The code uses `malloc` to allocate memory for a buffer. The size of the buffer is determined by the `size` variable. 

The code then attempts to read the file. If the file size is greater than the allocated buffer size, the code will attempt to read the file into the buffer. 

This can lead to a buffer overflow, as the code does not check the size of the file before attempting to read it.

177862,Exec Code,"YES
The code contains a potential use-after-free vulnerability. 

Here's why:

* **Memory Management:** The code allocates memory using `new` and `malloc`.
* **Potential Leak:** The code doesn't explicitly deallocate the memory allocated using `new` or `malloc`. 
* **Use-After-Free:** The code uses pointers that might have been deallocated.
