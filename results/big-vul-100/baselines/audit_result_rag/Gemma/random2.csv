The code contains a potential use-after-free vulnerability. 

Here's why:

* **Memory Management:** The code allocates memory using `new` and `malloc`.
* **Potential Leak:** The code doesn't explicitly deallocate the memory allocated using `new` or `malloc`.
* **Use-After-Free:** The code uses pointers that might have been deallocated.
