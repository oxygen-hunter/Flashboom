The provided C++ code does not appear to be vulnerable to the DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow_Mem._Corr. vulnerability described in the CVE-ID CVE-2013-6420. The code is a function that converts an ASN1_UTCTIME structure into a time_t value, which is a standard representation of time in C. The function does not execute any code or handle memory in a way that would lead to a denial of service or memory corruption.

The function simply parses a time string from the ASN1_UTCTIME structure and converts it into a time_t value using the mktime function. The function also handles the timezone offset and daylight savings time adjustments. There is no evidence of buffer overflows, improper memory handling, or other vulnerabilities in the provided code snippet.

The provided C++ code for the `blitMask` function does not appear to be vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack based on the information given. The code is a straightforward implementation of a mask blitting operation, which involves copying a portion of a bitmap to another location. The function iterates over the source bitmap's pixels and uses a `SplashPipe` to draw them to the destination.

The provided code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the potential for an infinite loop in the `blurMask` function. Specifically, the issue arises from the recursive calls to `blurMask` without a proper base case or termination condition.

In the `blurMask` function, the recursive calls are made with the same arguments for `src`, `srcData`, `srcWidth`, `srcHeight`, `scaledWidth`, and `scaledHeight`. This means that the function will keep calling itself indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow and eventually causing the program to crash or become unresponsive.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the recursive calls to `blurtMask` have a proper base case or termination condition. This can be done by adding a condition to check if the `scaledWidth` and `scaledHeight` have reached a certain threshold or if the `srcData` pointer has reached the end of the data.

Here's an example of how you can modify the `blurMask` function to include a base case:

```cpp
void blurMask(SplineImage *src, SplineImage *srcData, int srcWidth, int srcHeight,
              int scaledWidth, int scaledHeight, int threshold) {
