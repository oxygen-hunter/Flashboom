The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to a potential buffer overflow. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `strbuf` pointer, which is assigned the address of the data within the `timestr` structure. The code then uses `strbuf` to parse the time string without checking the length of the buffer it points to. If the `timestr->data` buffer is smaller than the expected size of the time string (13 characters plus a null terminator), this could lead to a buffer overflow when copying the time string into `strbuf`.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the provided code snippet, where the `strbuf` is assumed to have enough space to hold the time string. If the input time string is longer than expected, it could overwrite adjacent memory, leading to undefined behavior, which could be exploited to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the buffer pointed to by `strbuf` is large enough to hold the entire time string, including the null terminator. Additionally, the code should perform bounds checking before copying the time string into `strbuf`.",1956,250,10.494115829467773

The provided code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to the way it handles the `session_data_size` parameter. The vulnerability arises when the size of the data in the `gnutls_datum_t` structure (`psession.size`) is greater than the size of the buffer pointed to by `session_data`. If a malicious TLS server sends a large `SessionTicket` that exceeds the buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow when the code attempts to copy the data into `session_data`.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the original code snippet, where the check for `psession.size > *session_data_size` is performed after the data has already been packed into the `gnutls_datum_t` structure. If the size check fails, the code attempts to copy the data into `session_data`, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the actual size of the data is larger than the buffer size.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the buffer size is sufficient before attempting to copy the data. This can be done by passing the actual buffer size as a parameter to the `_gnutls_session_pack` function and using it to determine the maximum size of the data that can be safely copied into `session_data`.

The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to the potential for stack exhaustion caused by infinite recursion. This vulnerability arises from the recursive call to `dns_read_name` within the function itself, without proper bounds checking or termination conditions to prevent infinite recursion.

In the code, the recursive call to `dns_read_name` is made when a compressed pointer is encountered:

```cpp
if ((*reader & 0xc0) == 0xc0) {

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflow, which can lead to a DoS (Denial of Service) or potentially arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability arises from the calculation of `rowSize` and the subsequent memory allocation using `gmalloc`.

In the `SplashBitmap` constructor, `rowSize` is calculated based on the `mode` and `rowPad` values. The calculation involves operations like addition, multiplication, and bitwise shifts, which can result in integer overflow if the values of `width`, `mode`, or `rowPad` are large enough.

For example, consider the case where `width` is a large value, and `mode` is `splashModeXBGR8` or `splashModeCMYK8`. In these cases, `rowSize` is calculated as `width * 4`. If `width` is large enough, the multiplication can cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect `rowSize` value.

Later in the code, `rowSize` is used to allocate memory using `gmalloc(rowSize * height)`. If `rowSize` is incorrect due to integer overflow, this can lead to a memory allocation error, causing a denial of service.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add checks to ensure that the calculated `rowSize` does not exceed the maximum value that can be represented by an integer",1432,301,12.204098463058472

The provided code snippet is vulnerable due to the potential for a null pointer dereference. The `m_trust` pointer is reset with a dynamic cast of `trust` to `X509TrustEngine*`. If the dynamic cast fails (i.e., the plugin is not of the correct type), the `trust` pointer is deleted, and a `ConfigurationException` is thrown. However, the `m_trust` pointer is reset with the result of the dynamic cast, which will be `nullptr` if the cast fails.

Later in the code, there is a check to ensure that `m_trust` and `m_dummyCR` are not `nullptr` before throwing a `ConfigurationException`. If the dynamic cast fails and `m_trust` is set to `nullptr`, this check will pass, and the code will proceed without initializing `m_trust` with a valid `X509TrustEngine` pointer. This could lead to a null pointer dereference when the `m_trust` pointer is used later in the code.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that `m_trust` is always initialized with a valid `X509TrustEngine` pointer or handle the case where it is `nullptr` appropriately.",1838,288,11.787275552749634

The provided code is vulnerable due to a potential buffer overflow. The vulnerability arises from the way the `len` variable is calculated and used to allocate memory for the `target` pointer. The `len` variable is determined by the difference between the pointer `p` and the address of the first element of the `data` array. This length is then used to allocate memory for the `target` pointer with `xzalloc(len + 1)`.

The vulnerability occurs if the length calculated by `len = p - &(data[0]);` is incorrect due to an overflow or underflow, which can happen if the `nfs_packet->data` pointer is manipulated or corrupted before the calculation. If the length is too large, it could lead to a buffer overflow when allocating memory for `target`, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the length calculation is accurate and that the allocated memory for `target` is always within the bounds of the allocated `data` array.

If the values of `image->width` and `image->height` are large enough, their product could exceed the maximum value that an `int` can hold, leading to an integer overflow. This overflow can result in a negative value for `n`, which would cause the subsequent loop to behave unexpectedly:

In this loop, if `n` is negative, the loop would not execute as intended, potentially leading to a buffer underflow when accessing the `pixels` array. This could corrupt memory and cause a heap buffer overflow, which is a serious security vulnerability.

To fix this issue, you should ensure that the product of `image->width` and `image->height` does not exceed the maximum value of an `int`.

The provided code is vulnerable due to a potential buffer overflow issue. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `memcpy` function without proper bounds checking. The `memcpy` function is used to copy a portion of the source string to the destination buffer. However, the size of the destination buffer (`dst`) is not checked against the size of the data being copied (`p - s`). If the size of the data to be copied exceeds the size of the destination buffer, this can lead to a buffer overflow, which is a common security vulnerability.

Buffer overflows can lead to various security issues, such as arbitrary code execution, crashes, and data corruption. In this case, an attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by crafting a packet with a carefully chosen string that causes the `memcpy` function to write beyond the bounds of the `dst` buffer, leading to a potential security breach.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should include proper bounds checking to ensure that the size of the data being copied does not exceed the size of the destination buffer.

The provided code is vulnerable to a potential integer overflow issue. The vulnerability arises from the following line:

```cpp
if (size > mmem->limit - sizeof(gs_malloc_block_t)) {
```

In this line, the code checks if the requested size (`size`) is greater than the available memory (`mmem->limit`) minus the size of the `gs_malloc_block_t` structure. If the result of this subtraction is negative, it indicates that the requested size is too large to be allocated.

However, if `mmem->limit` is a very large value and `size` is a very small value, the subtraction could result in an integer overflow, causing the value to wrap around and become a positive number. This would lead to an incorrect comparison and potentially allow the allocation of a larger block than intended, which could cause a denial of service (DoS) by exhausting system resources.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to ensure that the subtraction operation does not result in an integer overflow. One possible solution is to use a larger integer type for the `size` and `mmem->limit` variables, such as `size_t`, which is guaranteed to be able to hold the maximum size of an object in memory.

The provided code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles the decoding of the RSA_PSS_PARAMS structure. The vulnerability arises from the potential for a NULL pointer dereference when the mask generation function (MGF) parameter is missing in the RSA_PSS_PARAMS structure.

In the code, the function `rsa_pss_decode` checks if the `alg->parameter` is not NULL and if its type is `V_ASN1_SEQUENCE`. If these conditions are met, it proceeds to decode the RSA_PSS_PARAMS structure. However, if the MGF parameter is missing, the pointer `pss->maskGenAlgorithm` will be NULL, and the subsequent code will attempt to access the `parameter` field of this NULL pointer, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

This vulnerability is similar to the one described in CVE-2015-3194, where a missing MGF parameter in an RSA PSS signature causes a NULL pointer dereference and application crash. To fix this vulnerability, the code should be updated to handle the case where the MGF parameter is missing, and ensure that the `pmaskHash` pointer is not dereferenced if it is NULL.",1311,296,11.826058387756348
