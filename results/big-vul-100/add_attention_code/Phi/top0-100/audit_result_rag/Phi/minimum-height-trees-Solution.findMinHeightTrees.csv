177742,DoS Overflow," YES, the provided code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack, similar to the vulnerability described in the original code snippet. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly validate the size of the `session_data` buffer before copying data into it.

In the `findMinHeightTrees` function, the `memcpy` function is used to copy `psession.size` bytes from `psession.data` to `session_data`. If `psession.size` is larger than the size of the buffer pointed to by `session_data`, this will result in a buffer overflow, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) or other security issues.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that `psession.size` does not exceed the size of the buffer pointed to by `session_data` before performing the `memcpy` operation. This can be done by adding an additional check before the `memcpy` call:

```cpp
if (psession.size > *session_right_data_size) {
    ret = GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER;
    goto error;
}

if (session_data!= NULL) {
    memcpy(session_data, psession.data, psession.size);

177792,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided C++ code is vulnerable to an integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the calculation of `rowSize` and the subsequent memory allocation using `gmalloc`. The `rowSize` is calculated based on the `mode` and can be affected by the `rowPad` parameter. If the `width` or `rowPad` is large enough, the calculation of `rowSize` can overflow an integer value, leading to an incorrect `rowSize` value.

For example, if `width` is a large value and `rowPad` is also a large value, the expression `(width + 7) >> 3` or `width * 3` or `width * 4` can cause an integer overflow. This overflow can result in a negative or incorrect `rowSize`, which when used in the `gmalloc` call, can lead to a memory allocation error or a buffer overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add checks to ensure that the calculated `rowSize` does not exceed the maximum value of an integer. Additionally, you should consider using a larger integer type (e.g., `int64_t`) if the expected range of `width` and `rowPad` values can cause overflow with a regular `int`.",1503,270,10.39461350440979

Therefore, the `findMinHeightTrees` function is not vulnerable to the specific DoS vulnerability mentioned for `drm_load_edid_firmware`.",1384,273,10.494447469711304

177891,DoS," YES, the provided code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in the code is related to the handling of the `maskGenAlgorithm` parameter in the `rsa_pss_decode` function. The code checks if the `maskGenAlgorithm` is not NULL and if its type is `V_ASN1_SEQUENCE`. However, it does not check if the `maskGenAlgorithm` parameter is actually present in the ASN.1 structure before attempting to access its value. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the `maskGenAlgorithm` parameter is missing, which is a potential DoS vulnerability.

In the context of the CVE-ID CVE-2015-3194, the vulnerability arises when an RSA PSS signature lacks a mask generation function parameter. The provided code does not explicitly check for the presence of the `maskGenAlgorithm` parameter, which could lead to a similar issue if the parameter is missing or not properly set in the ASN.1 structure.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should include an additional check to ensure that the `maskGenAlgorithm` parameter is present before attempting to access its value. This can be done by checking if the `maskGenAlgorithm` pointer is not NULL before dereferencing it.",1382,285,10.92575216293335

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it handles XML parsing. The vulnerability is related to XML External Entities (XXE), which can be exploited to read arbitrary files on the server. This is because the code sets `PG(allow_url_fopen)` to `1`, which allows the parser to open URLs. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious XML file that includes a reference to an external entity pointing to a sensitive file on the server. When the parser processes this XML, it could inadvertently disclose the contents of that file.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-ID CVE-2013-1824, where the SOAP parser in PHP before version 5.3.22 and 5.4.x before 5.4.12 allowed remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a SOAP WSDL file containing an XML external entity declaration.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `allow_url_fopen` setting is disabled when parsing XML documents, or use a more secure XML parser that properly handles external entities. Additionally, always keep your software up to date with the latest security patches.",1613,267,10.306192636489868

The provided C++ code for `soap_xmlParseMemory` is vulnerable due to the way it handles XML parsing. The vulnerability is related to XML External Entities (XXE), which can be exploited to read arbitrary files on the server. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not disable the processing of external entities, which is a known issue in older versions of the libxml2 library used for XML parsing.

In the code snippet, the `xmlParseDocument` function is called without setting the `XML_PARSE_NOENT` option, which would disable the processing of external entities. This means that an attacker could potentially craft a malicious XML file with an external entity that references a sensitive file on the server, leading to unautilibxml2.

To fix this vulnerability, you should set the `XML_PARSE_NOENT` option before parsing the XML document:

```cpp
ctxt->options |= XML_PARSE_NOENT;
```

By setting this option, the parser will not process external entities, thus mitigating the XXE vulnerability.",1531,243,9.37857985496521

The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to the way it handles XML parsing. The vulnerability is related to XML External Entities (XXE), which can be exploited to read arbitrary files on the server. This is because the code uses `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` with a filename that could be manipulated by an attacker to point to a file on the server that the application has access to.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the provided information (CVE-2013-1EE2), where the SOAP parser in PHP before 5.3.22 and 5.4.x before 5.4.12 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a SOAP WSDL file containing an XML external entity declaration.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should ensure that the XML parser is configured to disallow the processing of external entities or to use a more secure XML parser that is not susceptible to XXE attacks.

177911,Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided code is vulnerable to an integer overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability lies in the following lines:

```cpp
length = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
p      = table + 16;
count  = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
```

In this code, `length` and `count` are calculated based on the values read from the `table` array. If the values in the `table` array are too large, it could cause an integer overflow when calculating `length` and `count`. This overflow can lead to incorrect values for `length` and `count`, which in turn can cause the code to access invalid memory locations or perform incorrect calculations.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a `table` array with specific values that cause an integer overflow, leading to a potential arbitrary code execution or crash of the program.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add checks to ensure that the values read from the `table` array do not cause an integer overflow when calculating `length` and `count`. You can use functions like `std::numeric_limits<T>::max()` to determine the maximum value that can be safely stored in a variable of type `T`.",1268,273,10.443929195404053
