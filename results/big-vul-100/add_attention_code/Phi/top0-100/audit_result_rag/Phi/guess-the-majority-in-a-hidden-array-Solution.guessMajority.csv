177740,DoS Exec Code Overflow Mem. Corr.," YES

The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to a potential buffer overflow. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `strbuf` pointer, which is allocated using `estrdup` to duplicate the string pointed to by `timestr->data`. The `estrdup` function allocates memory for the new string and copies the content of the original string into it. However, there is no check to ensure that the size of the allocated memory is sufficient to hold the copied string, including the null terminator.

If the length of the string pointed to by `timestr->data` is greater than the size of the allocated memory, the `strbuf` pointer will point to a buffer that is not large enough to hold the entire string. This can lead to a buffer overflow when the `atoi` function is called on the `thestr` pointer, which is a pointer to a part of the `strbuf` buffer.

A buffer overflow can lead to memory corruption, which may result in a denial of service (DoS) or even arbitrary code execution, depending on the context in which the function is used and the surrounding code.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the allocated memory for `strbuf` is large enough to hold the entire string, including the null terminator. Additionally, it would be safer to use safer string handling functions, such as `strncpy`,",2043,301,12.593109607696533

177742,DoS Overflow," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in the provided code is similar to the one in the original function. The issue arises from the fact that the size of the buffer (`session_data_size`) is not verified before copying data into it. If a malicious server sends a large `SessionTicket`, the `memcpy` operation could write more data than the allocated buffer can hold, leading to a buffer overflow.

In the provided code, the check `if (psession.size > *session_data_size)` is present, but it is not sufficient to prevent the vulnerability. The problem is that the `psession.size` is not necessarily the same as the size of the data that needs to be copied. The `gnutls_datum_t` structure contains a `size` field, which is the size of the data it points to, but the `memcpy` operation uses `psession.size` as the number of bytes to copy. If the `psession.size` is larger than the actual data size, it could still lead to a buffer overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the size of the data to be copied is not larger than the size of the buffer. This can be done by using the actual size of the data pointed by `psession.data` instead of `psession.size` in the `memcpy`",1278,301,12.043944120407104

The provided code is vulnerable to a Time-Memory Tradeoff (TMT) attack, specifically a type of side-channel attack known as a cache timing attack. This vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses conditional branches based on the values of the elements in the array, which can lead to variable execution times depending on the input data. An attacker could potentially exploit this behavior to gain information about the secret values in the array by measuring the execution time of the function.

In the `guessMajority` function, the execution time can vary depending on the values of the elements in the array. For example, the loop that iterates over the array and compares the values at indices 0, 1, 2, and i (or 3) can take different amounts of time depending on whether the values are equal or not. An attacker could use this information to deduce the values of the array elements by carefully crafting inputs and measuring the execution time of the function.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use constant-time algorithms that do not rely on conditional branches based on the values of the elements in the array. This can be achieved by using bitwise operations and avoiding data-dependent branching. Additionally, the code should be carefully reviewed and tested to ensure that it does not leak any sensitive information through side channels.",3910,298,13.202454566955566

The provided code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the recursive nature of the `ldap_parse_tree` function. An attacker can craft a malicious LDAP filter with a deeply nested structure, causing the function to recurse indefinitely and potentially exhaust system resources, leading to a DoS condition.

For example, an attacker could create a filter with a nested structure like this:

```

The provided code is vulnerable due to the potential for stack exhaustion caused by recursive calls in the `dns_read_name` function. The vulnerability arises from the handling of compressed pointers, which can lead to infinite recursion or a long chain of valid pointers being processed.

In the `dns_read_name` function, the line:

```c++

The provided C++ code is vulnerable to a DoS (Denial of Service) attack due to a potential integer overflow issue. The function `guessMajority` uses an `ArrayReader` object to query values from an array. The loop iterates from `reader.length() - 1` down to `4`, and within the loop, it queries values using indices that are calculated based on the loop variable `i`.

The vulnerability arises when the `reader.query` function is called with indices that may exceed the bounds of the array. If the `reader.length()` is less than `4`, the function will attempt to access elements outside the bounds of the array, which can lead to undefined behavior, including a DoS attack if the function is part of a larger system that relies on the correctness of this function.

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflow, which can lead to a DoS (Denial of Service) or potentially arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability arises from the calculation of `rowSize` and the subsequent memory allocation using `gmalloc`.

In the `SplashBitmap` constructor, `rowSize` is calculated based on the `mode` and then adjusted by `rowPad`. The calculation of `rowSize` can result in an integer overflow if the width and rowPad values are large enough. This overflow can lead to a negative `rowSize` or a smaller `rowSize` than expected, which in turn affects the memory allocation.

The line `data = (SplashColorPtr)gmalloc(rowSize * height);` allocates memory based on the calculated `rowSize`. If `rowSize` is negative or smaller than expected due to integer overflow, this can lead to a memory allocation error or a smaller buffer than needed. This can cause a DoS if the program crashes when trying to access or write to this buffer, or it could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if the program writes beyond the allocated buffer and overwrites adjacent memory.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add checks to ensure that `rowSize` does not overflow and that the memory allocation is successful. Additionally, you should consider using safer memory allocation functions that can handle large sizes and provide error",1519,301,12.028888940811157

177840,+Info," YES, the given code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the handling of the string length and the escape sequence processing. The code is supposed to escape certain characters in a string, but it does not properly handle the length of the input string, which can lead to buffer overflows.

In the `ldb_dn_escape_internal` function, the while loop condition `p - src < len` is used to iterate over the input string. However, the function does not check if the destination buffer `dst` is large enough to hold the escaped string. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the destination buffer is smaller than the escaped string.

Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the input string contains a null character (`'\0'`). This can cause the function to read beyond the end of the string, leading to potential memory corruption.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the escaped string and add proper null character handling.",1838,215,8.821150541305542

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it handles string lengths and memory allocation. The vulnerability arises from the assumption that the size of the output string will not exceed twice the size of the input string (`2*(n+1)`). This assumption may not hold true for all inputs, especially when dealing with multi-byte characters or when the input contains characters that require more than one byte to represent in memory.

In the `strupper_talloc_n_handle` function, the `talloc_array` function is used to allocate memory for the destination string, which is based on the assumption that the size of the output string will not exceed twice the size of the input string. However, this assumption may not hold true for all inputs, especially when dealing with multi-byte characters or when the input contains characters that require more than one byte to represent in memory.

If the assumption fails, the `talloc_realloc` function may not be able to correctly reallocate the memory for the destination string, leading to potential memory corruption or other unintended behavior. This can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to handle string lengths more robustly, taking into account the possibility of multi-byte characters and ensuring that the allocated memory is sufficient to hold the output string. Additionally,",1470,301,12.058161735534668

The provided code snippet is vulnerable due to the way it handles the `sharename` pointer. The code attempts to modify the `sharename` pointer by incrementing it after duplicating the `share` string. However, the `sharename` pointer is not initialized with a valid memory address before it is used. This can lead to undefined behavior, as the pointer may point to an invalid memory location.

Additionally, the code does not check if the `talloc_strdup` function call was successful, which could result in a NULL pointer being dereferenced if memory allocation fails. This could lead to a segmentation fault or other memory-related issues.

Moreover, the code does not properly handle the case where the `server` parameter is NULL. If `server` is NULL, the code assigns `sharename` to it, which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference if `sharename` is not properly initialized.

The provided code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability (CVE-ID: CVE-2015-5252, CWE-ID: CWE-264). The vulnerability arises from the use of the `SMB_VFS_REALPATH` function without proper validation of the resolved path. This can allow an attacker to bypass file access restrictions by creating a symbolic link that points outside of the intended share.

In the code, the `SMB_VFS_REALPATH` function is called with the argument `"".""`, which means it will return the absolute path of the current working directory. If an attacker can manipulate the current working directory or the symbolic links in the file system, they may be able to trick the application into accessing files outside of the intended share.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the resolved path returned by `SMB_VFS_REALPATH` to ensure it is within the intended share directory. This can be done by checking if the resolved path starts with the expected share directory path or by using other methods to verify the path's legitimacy.",3214,252,11.007294178009033

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it handles the execution of an external command using the `execl` function. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `editor_program` string is constructed by concatenating the `editor_program` constant with the `outname` file path and a potential command-line argument (`"" - ""`). If an attacker can control the `outname` file path, they could inject additional shell commands into the `editor_program` string.

For example, if an attacker sets `outname` to something like `""; rm -rf / #"", the resulting `editor_program` string would be `""ed_program ; rm -rf / #""`. When the `execl` function is called, it would execute both the `ed` command and the `rm -rf /` command, leading to a potential system-wide deletion of files.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly sanitize the `outname` file path and ensure that it does not contain any shell metacharacters or command injections. Additionally, the code should use a safer method for executing external commands, such as using the `execvp` function with a fixed command and arguments, or using a library that provides a higher-level abstraction for command execution with proper argument handling.",3003,287,12.370121240615845

The provided code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles the '\0' character in the pattern matching function. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code incorrectly skips '\0' characters when processing '?' characters in the pattern. This can lead to buffer over-reads, causing the program to read beyond the end of the input string, which can result in information disclosure or a crash.

In the original vulnerable code, the issue was that when a '?' character was encountered in the pattern, the code would decrement the `stringdashes` counter if the next character in the string was '\0'. This would cause the pattern matching function to continue processing the string even after reaching the end, leading to a potential buffer over-read.

In the modified code you provided, the same issue still exists. The line:

```cpp

However, if the server sends more data than expected, it could lead to a buffer overflow, which is a classic security vulnerability.

This incorrect value could then be used to allocate an incorrect amount of memory with `Xmalloc`, potentially leading to a buffer overflow when `_XReadPad` is called.

Additionally, the code does not check for integer overflow when calculating the length of the extensions. If `rep.length` is very large, the calculation of `length = *ch;` could also overflow, leading to incorrect behavior when unpacking the strings.

These issues could lead to a denial of service (DoS) or other unspecified impacts, as mentioned in the vulnerability summary.",1894,204,8.525882244110107
177922,Exec Code Overflow," YES

The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to a potential buffer overflow in the `add_param_to_argv` function. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `param_buffer` array is statically allocated with a fixed size of 1024 bytes. If the input string `parsestart` is longer than 1023 characters (excluding the null terminator), it will overflow the buffer, leading to undefined behavior. This can potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code or cause a crash.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-ID CVE-2019-11360, where a buffer overflow in iptables-restore in netfilter iptables 1.8.2 allows an attacker to crash the program or potentially gain code execution via a specially crafted iptables-save file.

To fix this vulnerability, you should consider using a safer alternative to C-style strings, such as `std::string`, and ensure that the buffer size is dynamically allocated based on the input size. Additionally, you should always validate the input size and ensure that it does not exceed the allocated buffer size.",2302,261,11.052095174789429
177923,Bypass," NO

The provided C++ code for the `move_uploaded_file` function does not appear to be vulnerable to the Bypass.cpp vulnerability described in the CVE-2015-2348. The vulnerability in the original PHP code was due to the handling of filenames containing null bytes, which could be exploited to bypass file extension restrictions. The provided C++ code does not contain any such handling of filenames or file paths, and it does not directly address the specific vulnerability mentioned.

However, it is essential to note that without a complete understanding of the context in which this code is used and the overall security measures in place, it is not possible to definitively say that the code is entirely secure.",1900,162,6.759796619415283

The provided C++ code for the `openssl_seal` function is vulnerable to a potential integer overflow issue. The vulnerability arises from the following line:

```cpp
if (!EVP_SealInit(ctx, cipher, eks, eksl, &iv_buf[0], pkeys, nkeys) ||
                   !EVP_SealUpdate(ctx, buf, &len1, (unsigned char *)data, (int)data_len) ||
                   !EVP_SealFinal(ctx, buf + len1, &len2)) {
```

In this line, the `EVP_SealUpdate` function is called with the `data_len` variable as the length of the data to be encrypted. If `data_len` is very large, it could cause an integer overflow when passed as an `int` to the `EVP_SealUpdate` function. This could lead to unexpected behavior or a crash.

To fix this issue, you should use a larger integer type (e.g., `size_t`) for the `data_len` variable and pass it as such to the `EVP_SealUpdate` function. This will help prevent potential integer overflow issues.

Additionally, the `guessMajority` function is not related to the `openssl_se",4032,301,13.203408479690552
