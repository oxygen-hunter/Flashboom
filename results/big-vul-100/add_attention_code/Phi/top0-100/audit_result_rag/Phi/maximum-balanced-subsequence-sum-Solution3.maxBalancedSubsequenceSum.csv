The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to a potential integer overflow when calculating the `thetime.tm_year` value. The code assumes that the year is in the 20th or 21st century by adding 100 to the `thetime.tm_year` if it is less than 68. However, this assumption may not hold for all inputs, especially for dates before 1968. If the input year is before 1968, the addition of 100 could cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect year value and potentially incorrect behavior of the `mktime` function.

Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the input string is not a valid time string, which could lead to undefined behavior. The check for the string length being less than 13 is a good start, but it does not validate the format of the time string. If the string is not in the expected format, the parsing using `atoi` could lead to incorrect values being assigned to the `thetime` structure, which could also result in incorrect behavior of the `mktime` function.

In summary, the code is vulnerable due to the potential integer overflow when calculating the `thetime.pta_year` value and the lack of proper validation for the input time string format.",1922,288,11.425323009490967

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflow in the calculation of `rowSize`. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `rowSize` is calculated based on the width of the bitmap and the color mode, which can lead to a very large value. When this value is then used to allocate memory with `gmalloc`, it can cause an integer overflow if the resulting size exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the data type used for the size (typically `size_t`).

In the code, the `rowSize` is calculated using operations like `width * 3` or `width * 4`, and then it is further manipulated by adding `rowPad - 1` and subtracting `rowSize % rowPad`. If `width` is large enough, these operations can result in a value that is too large to be represented by `size_t`, leading to an integer overflow.

When an integer overflow occurs, the resulting value can wrap around and become a smaller, incorrect value. This can lead to the allocation of a smaller block of memory than intended, which can cause a buffer overflow when the bitmap data is written to this memory. A buffer overflow can lead to a denial of service (application crash) or, in some cases, arbitrary code execution if the application's memory layout is exploitable.

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it calculates the length of the data buffer and uses it for memory operations. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the length of the data buffer (`len`) is determined by the difference between the pointer `p` and the address of the first element of the `data` array. This length is then used to allocate memory for the `target` pointer.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the original code snippet, where the length of the buffer is directly used for memory operations without proper bounds checking. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the length is larger than the allocated buffer size, allowing an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory and potentially execute arbitrary code.

In the provided code, the vulnerability is present in the following lines:

```cpp
len = p - &(data[0]);
*target = xzalloc(len + 1);
```

The `len` variable is calculated by subtracting the address of the first element of the `data` array from the pointer `p`. This length is then used to allocate memory for the `target` pointer using the `xzalloc` function. If the length is larger than the actual size of the `data` array, it can lead to a buffer overflow.

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it handles the '*' and '?' characters in the pattern matching function. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the incorrect handling of '\0' characters when matching patterns that include '?'.

In the original vulnerable code, when the pattern contains a '?', the code decrements `stringdashes` if a '\0' character is encountered, which can lead to a buffer over-read. However, in the provided code snippet, the handling of '\0' characters has been corrected by removing the decrement of `stringdashes` when a '\0' character is encountered.

Despite this correction, the code still contains a potential vulnerability related to the handling of '*' and '?' characters. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the code does not properly handle cases where the pattern contains multiple '*' or '?' characters in a row, which could lead to incorrect pattern matching and potentially a denial of service (DoS) if the input is crafted maliciously.

Additionally, the server should be configured to disable the processing of external entities in the XML parser to prevent XXE attacks.",1450,258,10.000110149383545

The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack based on the given information. The code is a function for finding the maximum balanced subsequence sum in a vector of integers, which does not involve any user input or external data that could be manipulated to cause a DoS. The function uses standard algorithms and data structures from the C++ Standard Library, and there is no evidence of buffer overflows, integer overflows, or other common vulnerabilities in the code snippet provided.",3476,112,5.132075786590576

177907,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the way the code handles memory allocation and deallocation. Specifically, the `lineBuf` is allocated with a size of `srcWidth` but is not properly freed in all execution paths. This can lead to a memory leak, which is a type of resource exhaustion vulnerability.

In the provided code snippet, the `lineBuf` is allocated with `gmalloc(srcWidth)` and is supposed to be freed with `gfree(lineBuf)` at the end of the function. However, if the function exits prematurely due to an error or an exceptional condition (which is not shown in the snippet), the `lineBuf` may not be freed, leading to a memory leak.

Additionally, the code contains a nested loop where the inner loop's iterator `y` is redeclared, which can lead to confusion and potential errors. However, this is not directly related to the vulnerability mentioned above.

To fix the vulnerability, ensure that all allocated memory is properly freed in all execution paths, and consider using RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) techniques or smart pointers to manage memory automatically.",1699,261,10.128427743911743
177909,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the way the `pixBuf` buffer is allocated and accessed. The buffer is allocated with a size of `srcWidth` but is used as if it were an array of `int`s, which would require a buffer size of `srcWidth * sizeof(int)`. This discrepancy can lead to a buffer overflow when accessing `pixBuf[j]`, as the actual allocated size is smaller than the size being accessed. This can cause a crash (DoS) and potentially allow for arbitrary code execution (Exec) if an attacker can control the input to manipulate the buffer access.

Additionally, the code contains a nested loop where the inner loop's index `y` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration, which is likely a mistake and could lead to incorrect behavior or further vulnerabilities.

The CVE-ID CVE-2013-1788 and CWE-ID CWE-119 mentioned are related to a different vulnerability in the Poppler library, which is not directly applicable to the provided code snippet.

The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to the potential for integer overflow in the following line:

```cpp
length = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
```

The function `TT_NEXT_ULONG(p)` is used to read an unsigned long integer from the byte array `table`. If the value of `length` exceeds the maximum value that an unsigned long integer can hold (which is `18446744073709551615` on most systems), an integer overflow will occur. This can lead to incorrect calculations and potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the program's behavior, leading to a code execution vulnerability.

Additionally, the code does not check for integer overflow when calculating the `count` variable:

```cpp
count  = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
```

If the value of `count` exceeds the maximum value that an unsigned long integer can hold, an integer overflow will occur, which can also lead to incorrect calculations and potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the program's behavior.

In summary, the code is vulnerable to integer overflow, which can lead to a code execution vulnerability.",1163,271,10.369612693786621

The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to an Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2009-0946. The code does not exhibit any obvious signs of integer overflows that could lead to arbitrary code execution. The use of `FT_UInt`, `FT_UShort`, and `FT_ULong` suggests that the code is using fixed-width integer types, which can help prevent overflows.

The provided C++ code for `XListExtensions` is vulnerable due to the potential for an out-of-bounds write, which can lead to a denial of service (DoS) or remote code execution. This vulnerability is similar to the one described in CVE-2018-14600, where the function `XListExtensions` in `ListExt.c` interprets a variable as signed instead of unsigned, resulting in an out-of-bounds write.

In the provided code, the vulnerability arises from the following line:

```cpp
rlen = rep.length << 2;
```

Here, `rep.length` is a signed integer, and if it is negative, the left shift operation will produce a negative value for `rlen`. This negative value, when used as an offset, can lead to an out-of-bounds write when accessing the memory pointed to by `ch`.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that `rep.length` is always a non-negative value before performing the left shift operation. You can do this by adding a check to ensure that `rep.length` is within the valid range before using it to calculate `rlen`.",1754,267,10.354769706726074

177920,nan," YES

The provided code is vulnerable due to a potential buffer overflow. The vulnerability arises from the way the function `_XReadPad` is used to read data into the buffer `ch`. The function `_XReadPad` is used to read a specified number of bytes from the X server into the buffer `ch`. However, the code does not check if the actual number of bytes read by `_XReadPad` is less than `nbytes`. If the X server sends fewer bytes than requested, the loop that unpacks the data into null-terminated strings may read past the end of the data, leading to a buffer overflow.

The loop that unpacks the data into null-terminated strings assumes that the length of each path is correctly followed by a null byte. If the X server sends fewer bytes than requested, the loop may read past the end of the data, leading to a buffer overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the actual number of bytes read by `_XReadPad` and ensure that the loop does not read past the end of the data. Additionally, the code should handle the case where the X server sends fewer bytes than requested, to prevent buffer overflows.",1697,256,9.9215087890625
177921,nan," YES

The provided code snippet is vulnerable due to the way it handles the input data and the potential for integer overflow. The vulnerability arises from the line `rlen = rep.length << 2;` which can cause an integer overflow if `rep.length` is large enough. This could lead to an incorrect allocation size for `ch`, potentially causing a buffer overflow when `_XReadPad` is called.

Additionally, the code does not check for integer overflow when calculating the sum of the sequence, which could lead to incorrect results or undefined behavior. The use of `INT_MAX >> 2` without proper checks for overflow can also be problematic.

Moreover, the code assumes that the input data is well-formed and does not perform any bounds checking on the indices used to access the `nums` array in the `maxBalancedSubsequenceSum` function. This could lead to out-of-bounds access if the input vector `nums` is not properly initialized or if the indices are manipulated in an unexpected way.

Lastly, the code uses a segment tree to compute the maximum balanced subsequence sum, but it does not handle the case where the input vector `nums` contains negative numbers, which could lead to incorrect results or undefined behavior.

In summary, the code is vulnerable due to potential integer overflow, lack of bounds checking, and improper handling of negative numbers in",1773,301,11.62279987335205

The provided code is vulnerable due to a potential buffer overflow in the `add_param_to_argv` function. The vulnerability arises from the use of a fixed-size buffer `param_buffer[1024]` to store parameters parsed from the input string `parsestart`. If the input string contains more than 1023 characters (excluding the null terminator), the code will write beyond the bounds of the `param_buffer` array, leading to a buffer overflow. This can result in undefined behavior, including crashes or, in the worst case, arbitrary code execution if an attacker crafts a malicious input string.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-2019-11360, where a buffer overflow in iptables-restore in netfilter iptables 1.8.2 allowed an attacker to crash the program or potentially gain code execution via a specially crafted iptables-save file.

To fix this vulnerability, you should consider using a safer alternative to C-style strings and fixed-size buffers, such as `std::string` or `std::vector<char>`, which can dynamically resize to accommodate the input data. Additionally, you should validate the input data to ensure it does not exceed the expected size before processing it.",2181,293,11.886075496673584
177923,Bypass," YES

The provided C++ code for `move_uploaded_file` is vulnerable due to the same Bypass vulnerability as mentioned in the original PHP code snippet. The vulnerability arises from the handling of file paths that may contain null bytes (`\x00`). The code in question truncates the path at the first occurrence of a null byte, which can be exploited by an attacker to bypass file extension restrictions and potentially create files with unexpected names in locations outside the intended directory.

In the provided code, the `php_copy_file_ex` function is used, which is a wrapper for the `copy` and `unlink` system calls. The vulnerability exists if the underlying `copy` function does not properly handle null bytes in the file path, allowing an attacker to bypass the intended file extension restrictions.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the underlying system calls used in the `php_copy_file_ex` function correctly handle null bytes in file paths. Additionally, it is recommended to use the `move_uploaded_file` function provided by PHP, which is designed to handle uploaded files securely and is not vulnerable to this specific issue.",1779,257,10.006612062454224
