177741,DoS Overflow," YES

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly check the size of the `session_data` buffer before copying data into it. If the `psession.size` is larger than the size pointed to by `session_data`, the `memcpy` function will write past the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. This can result in a denial of service (DoS) as it may corrupt the memory and cause the application to crash.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the original code snippet, where the `gnutls_session_get_data` function does not ensure that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the data being copied into it. This can be exploited by an attacker by crafting a session with a large `SessionTicket` that, when processed by the vulnerable function, leads to a buffer overflow and potentially a crash of the application.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should include a check to ensure that `session_data_size` is at least as large as `psession.size` before performing the `memcpy` operation. If the buffer is not large enough, the function should handle the error appropriptaely, such as by returning an error code or allocating a larger buffer if possible.",1396,291,11.17734670639038
177742,DoS Overflow," YES

The provided code snippet for `gnutls_session_get_data` is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, similar to the vulnerability described in the original code. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check the size of the `session_data` buffer before copying data into it. If the size of the data in `psession.data` exceeds the size of the buffer pointed to by `session_data`, a buffer overflow can occur, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) or other security issues.

In the code, the check `if (psession.size > *session_data_size)` is performed before the `memcpy` operation. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent a buffer overflow because it only checks the size of the data in `psession.data`, not the size of the buffer itself. If the `session_data_size` is smaller than the actual size of the buffer, the check will pass, but the `memcpy` operation will still overflow the buffer.

To fix this vulnerability, the function should ensure that the size of the buffer pointed to by `session_data` is at least as large as the size of the data in `psession.data`. This can be done by passing the size of the buffer as an argument to the function and using it in the `memcpy` operation, like this",1366,301,11.51870584487915

The provided C++ code for the `SplashBitmap` constructor is vulnerable to integer overflow, which can lead to a DoS (Denial of Service) or potentially arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability arises from the calculation of `rowSize` and the subsequent memory allocation using `gmalloc`.

In the code, `rowSize` is calculated based on the `mode` and the `width` of the bitmap. The calculation involves operations like addition, multiplication, and bitwise shifting, which can cause integer overflow if the values of `width` and `rowSize` are large enough.

For example, consider the case where `mode` is `splashModeMono1`. The calculation of `rowSize` is as follows:

```cpp
rowSize = (width + 7) >> 3;
```

If `width` is a large value, the addition of 7 can cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect `rowSize` value.

Similarly, in the case where `mode` is `splashModeRGB8`, `splashModeBGR8`, `splashModeXBGR8`, or `splashModeCMYK8`, the calculation of `rowSize` involves multiplication:

```cpp
rowSize = width * 3; // for RGB8, BGR8

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it handles XML parsing. The vulnerability is related to XML External Entities (XXE), which can be exploited to read arbitrary files on the server. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not disable the processing of external entities within the XML documents it parses.

In the code snippet, the `xmlParseDocument` function is called without any checks for external entities. If an XML document with an external entity reference is parsed, it could lead to the disclosure of sensitive files on the server.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should ensure that the XML parser is configured to disable the processing of external entities. This can be done by setting the `XML_PARSE_NOENT` option in the `xmlSetParserOptions` function before parsing the document.

Here's an example of how to modify the code to disable external entities:

```cpp
xmlSetParserOptions(ctxt, XML_PARSE_NOENT);
xmlParseDocument(ctxt);
```

By adding this line before parsing the document, you can prevent the XXE vulnerability in the code.",1717,253,9.837871313095093

The provided C++ code for `soap_xmlParseFile` is vulnerable due to the way it handles XML parsing. The vulnerability is related to XML External Entities (XXE), which can be exploited to read arbitrary files on the server. This is because the code uses `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` to parse XML files, which can be influenced by XML External Entity (XXE) attacks if the XML parser is not properly configured to prevent such attacks.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the provided summary (CVE-2013-1824), where the SOAP parser in PHP before version 5.3.22 and 5.4.x before 5.4.12 allowed remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a SOAP WSDL file containing an XML external entity declaration.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should ensure that the XML parser is configured to disable the processing of external entities or to limit the entities to a safe subset. Additionally, keeping the software up to date with the latest security patches is crucial to protect against known vulnerabilities.",1659,244,9.449995994567871

177901,Overflow," YES

The provided C++ code for the function `_asn1_ltostr` is vulnerable to an integer overflow. The vulnerability arises from the line `temp[start + count] = '0' + (char) r;` where `r` is calculated as `v - d * 10`. If `v` is a very large number, `d * 10` could cause an integer overflow when subtracted from `v`, leading to an incorrect value of `r`. This incorrect value could then be used to access an out-of-bounds index in the `temp` array, potentially leading to a buffer overflow when the string is constructed.


Additionally, the code does not check if the `str` buffer provided is large enough to hold the resulting string, including the null terminator. If the `str` buffer is smaller than the size of the string that `v` represents, this could also lead to a buffer overflow when copying the string from `temp` to `str`.


The vulnerability type is indeed 'Overflow.cpp', and the code could be exploited in a similar manner to CVE-2015-2806, where an integer overflow can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.",1213,268,10.238288640975952

The provided code does not exhibit the vulnerability described in the CVE-2013-1789. The vulnerability in the original code was related to the use of the `imgCoordMungeLowerC` and `imgCoordMungeUpperC` functions, which could lead to a null pointer dereference if the coordinates were not properly validated. However, in the modified code, the coordinates are always checked and compared before being used, and the code ensures that the width and height are not zero to avoid division by zero errors.

The `findAnswer` function is unrelated to the vulnerability and is a separate algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph using Dijkstra'sin algorithm. It does not interact with the `Splash::arbitraryMaskTransform` function and does not introduce any vulnerabilities related to the original issue.",3685,189,8.156291961669922

177911,Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided C++ code is vulnerable to an integer overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability lies in the following lines:

```cpp
length = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
p      = table + 16;
count  = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
```

In this code, `TT_NEXT_ULONG` is a macro that reads an unsigned long integer from the byte array `table`. The vulnerability arises when the input `table` contains values that cause an integer overflow during the calculation of `length` and `count`.

For example, if the input `table` contains a large value that causes `length` to overflow, the subsequent calculation of `table + length` will also overflow, leading to an incorrect memory access. This can result in a buffer overflow, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the values read by `TT_NEXT_ULONG` do not cause an integer overflow. You can add checks to ensure that the values are within the expected range before performing the calculations. Additionally, you can use a safer data type, such as `std::uint64_t`, to handle larger values and prevent overflow.",1372,280,10.701575756072998
