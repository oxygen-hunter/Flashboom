177792,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided C++ code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the calculation of `rowSize` and the subsequent memory allocation using `gmalloc`. The issue is similar to the one described in the CVE-ID CVE-2009-3605, where integer overflow can occur.

In the code, `rowSize` is calculated based on the `mode` and then adjusted by adding `rowPad - 1` and subtracting the remainder of `rowSize % rowPad`. This adjustment is intended to align the row size to the nearest multiple of `rowPad`. However, if `rowSize` is already a multiple of `rowPad`, subtracting `rowSize % rowPad` will result in `rowSize` being set to 0.

The vulnerability arises when `rowSize` becomes 0 after the adjustment. In this case, the subsequent memory allocation `gmalloc(rowSize * height)` will allocate 0 bytes of memory, which is not a valid allocation and can lead to a denial of service (application crash) when the program tries to access or manipulate this non-existent memory.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that `rowSize` is never set to 0 after the adjustment. One way to do this is by adding a check to ensure that `rowSize` is at least 1 before performing the memory allocation",1680,301,11.55087399482727

The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to a potential buffer overflow. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `xzalloc` function to allocate memory for the `*target` pointer without checking the size of the allocated memory against the length of the data being copied into it. If the `len` variable, which is used to determine the size of the allocation, is larger than the actual size of the data being copied, it could lead to a buffer overflow. This is because `xzalloc` returns a pointer to a zero-initialized buffer of the requested size, but the code does not verify that the size of the data being copied does not exceed the allocated buffer size.

Additionally, the code does not check for null pointers before dereferencing `*target`, which could lead to undefined behavior if `*target` is a null pointer.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the size of the data being copied does not exceed the allocated buffer size and that `*target` is not a null pointer before dereferencing it.",1854,228,8.96315884590149

The provided C++ code for `XListExtensions` is not vulnerable to the same issue as the one described in the vulnerability summary (CVE-2018-14599). The vulnerability in the original code was due to an off-by-one error in handling the length of data read from the server, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

In the provided C++ code, the vulnerability is not present because it does not involve reading data from an external source (like a server) and handling it in a way that could lead to a buffer overflow. Instead, the code is performing operations on a 2D vector representing an image, and it is using a threshold to check for uniformity in the image data. The code does not have the same kind of vulnerability as the original code.",2055,177,7.333954572677612

The provided C++ code for `add_param_to_argv` is vulnerable due to a potential buffer overflow. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly handle the case where the input string `parsestart` is longer than the allocated buffer size of `param_buffer[1024]`. If the input string exceeds this size, it will cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to undefined behavior, crashes, or even code execution vulnerabilities.

In the context of the provided code, the vulnerability is related to the parsing of command-line arguments for the iptables-restore functionality. The code is designed to parse and process the input string, but it does not perform adequate bounds checking to ensure that the input string does not exceed the allocated buffer size.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to include proper bounds checking and validation of the input string length before copying it into the `param_buffer`. This can be achieved by using safer string manipulation functions or by implementing custom bounds checking logic. Additionally, it is recommended to use modern C++ string classes and containers, such as `std::string` and `std::vector`, which provide built-in bounds checking and memory management to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities.",2463,274,11.129086017608643
177923,Bypass," NO

The provided C++ code for the `move_uploaded_file` function does not appear to be vulnerable to the Bypass vulnerability described in CVE-2015-2348. The vulnerability in the original PHP code was due to the handling of pathnames containing null bytes, which could allow attackers to bypass file extension restrictions. The provided C++ code does not include any functionality related to handling file paths or extensions in a way that would introduce a similar vulnerability.",2061,109,4.686212778091431

The provided C++ code for the `resultGrid` function is not vulnerable to the specific vulnerability described in the PHP code snippet. The C++ code is a separate implementation that calculates the average of the surrounding pixels for each pixel in a given image, based on a threshold value. It does not involve any encryption or OpenSSL-related operations.",4193,76,3.8759868144989014
