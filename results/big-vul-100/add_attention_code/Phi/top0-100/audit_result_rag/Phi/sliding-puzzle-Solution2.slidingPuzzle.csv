The provided code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the use of the `unordered_map` data structure with a custom hash function for the `vector<int>` type. The `Hash<vector<int>>` is not a standard hash function and may not be well-optimized for all possible inputs, leading to potential performance issues.

In the worst-case scenario, if the hash function generates many collisions, the performance of the `unordered_right_heap` could degrade to O(n^2) complexity, where n is the number of elements in the map. This could cause the algorithm to take a very long time to complete, effectively denying service to legitimate users.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you can use a standard hash function for the `vector<int>` type, such as `std::hash<int>` or `boost::hash<int>`, which are well-optimized and less likely to cause performance issues.",3899,218,9.306307554244995

The provided C++ code for the `poppler_page_prepare_output_dev` function does not appear to be vulnerable to the DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability described in the CVE-2EE-2009-3605. The vulnerability in the original code was due to integer overflows when calculating the `cairo_width` and `cairo_height` values, which could lead to a buffer overflow when allocating memory for `cairo_data`.

In the provided code, the calculation of `cairo_width` and `cairo_height` is done using the `ceil` function, which should prevent integer overflow by rounding up the result to the nearest integer. Additionally, the code checks if the `transparent` flag is set and uses `memset` to initialize the `cairo_data` buffer with either `0x00` or `0xff`, depending on the value of the flag.

However, it is essential to note that the vulnerability in the original code was not solely due to the integer overflows in the `poppler_page_prepare_output_dev` function.

The code snippet provided is a standalone function that does not interact with XML files or external entities in a way that would expose it to XXE vulnerabilities.",1721,118,4.796714544296265
177901,Overflow," YES

The provided C++ code for the function `_asn1_ltostr` is vulnerable to an integer overflow. The vulnerability arises from the line where the remainder `r` is calculated:

```cpp
r = v - d * 10;
```

If `v` is a very large number, `d * 10` could overflow, causing an incorrect calculation of `r`. This could lead to an incorrect string representation of the number, and if the string is used in a context where its size is not properly checked, it could lead to a buffer overflow when copying the string into `str`.

However, the provided code snippet for the function `slidingPuzzle` does not contain the `_asn1_ltostr` function, and it does not seem to be related to the vulnerability described in the first code snippet. The `slidingPuzzle` function appears to be implementing a solver for the sliding puzzle problem using a priority queue and does not exhibit the overflow vulnerability present in `_asn1_ltostr`.",1387,236,9.123950481414795
177904,DoS," NO

The provided code for the `blitMask` function does not appear to be vulnerable based on the information given. The code is a straightforward implementation of a mask blitting operation, which involves copying a portion of a bitmap to another location with some form of masking or clipping. The vulnerability mentioned in the original code snippet (CVE-2013-1789) is not present in the revised code.

The revised code includes proper bounds checking and does not exhibit any obvious signs of a buffer overflow, null pointer dereference, or other common vulnerabilities. The `Splash::blitMask` function iterates over the pixels of the source bitmap and applies the mask to the destination area. The `if` conditions and loops are well-defined, and the function does not use any external input that could lead to a vulnerability without proper validation.

However, without a full context of the program and its environment, it is not possible to guarantee the absence of vulnerabilities. It is always recommended to perform thorough security reviews and testing to ensure the safety of the code.",2277,235,9.583695650100708

The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the DoS, Exec, or Code.Overflow vulnerabilities as described in the CWE-119 issue. The code is a sliding puzzle solver that uses a priority queue to find the shortest path to solve the puzzle. It does not involve any operations that could lead to a denial of service, execution of arbitrary code, or buffer overflows.",3350,92,4.339260578155518

The provided C++ code for the `Splash::scaleMaskYuXd` function does not appear to be vulnerable to the DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability described in the CVE-ID CVE-2013-1788. The code does not exhibit any of the specific behaviors that would lead to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution as per the details of the CVE-2013-1788 vulnerability.",2082,109,4.6890668869018555
177909,DoS Exec Code Overflow," NO

The provided C++ code for the `slidingPuzzle` function does not exhibit the vulnerabilities described in the original code snippet. The `slidingPuzzle` function is a different algorithm that solves a sliding puzzle problem using a heuristic search (specifically, A* search algorithm). It does not involve memory allocation or deallocation that could lead to a buffer overflow or memory corruption. The vulnerabilities mentioned in the original code snippet are related to memory management, which is not present in the `slidingPuzzle` function.",2086,120,5.115450620651245

The provided C++ code snippet for the `token_continue` function does not appear to be directly related to the vulnerability described in the CVE-ID CVE-2017-11714. The vulnerability mentioned is specific to the handling of references to the scanner state structure in Artifex Ghostscript, which is not evident in the given code snippet. The `token_continue` function seems to be a part of a lexer or tokenizer, which is a different component from the scanner state handling. Therefore, based on the provided code snippet alone, it is not possible to determine if it is vulnerable to the same issue.",1648,142,5.6572136878967285
