The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the Bypass.c++ vulnerability described in the CVE-2015-8467. The code is a function that calculates the minimum cost to travel between cities, given the cost of traveling between each pair of cities and the cost of apples in each city. The function uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between cities and then calculates the minimum cost to travel between cities while buying apples.

The vulnerability described in CVE-2015-8467 is related to the Samba software suite and involves bypassing intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC. The provided code does not involve any network communication or authentication mechanisms that could be exploited in a similar manner.

Therefore, the provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the Bypass.c++ vulnerability described in CVE-2015-8467.",2584,228,9.424021005630493

The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to a potential integer overflow issue. The vulnerability arises from the following line:

```cpp
if (thetime.tm_year < 68) {
    thetime.tm_year += 100;
}
```

In this code snippet, the `tm_year` field of the `struct tm` is being incremented by 100 if it is less than 68. However, the `tm_year` field represents the number of years since 1900. If the input time string represents a date before 1968, the `tm_year` field will be less than 68, and the code will increment it by 100.

This can lead to an integer overflow when the `tm_year` value exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in an `int` data type. The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is 2,147,483,647. If the input time string represents a date before 1968, the `tm_year` value will be incremented by 100, potentially causing an overflow when the value exceeds 2,147,483,647.

An integer overflow can lead to unexpected behavior, including incorrect results,",2063,301,12.100457429885864

177742,DoS Overflow," YES, the provided code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The vulnerability arises from the way the `memcpy` function is used to copy data from `psession.data` to `session_req.data`. If the size of the data pointed to by `psession.data` is larger than the size specified by `session_req_size`, it can lead to a buffer overflow.

In the code, the check `if (psession.size > *session_data_size)` is performed before the `memcpy` call. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent a buffer overflow because the `memcpy` function does not perform any bounds checking. If an attacker can control the size of `psession.size` and make it larger than the actual size of `session_data`, they can cause a buffer overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use a safer function like `memcpy_s` (if available) or perform bounds checking before calling `memcpy`. Here's an example of how you can modify the code to use `memcpy_s`:

```cpp
if (session_data!= NULL)
    {
        size_t actual_size = psession.size;
        if (actual_size > *session_data_size)

The provided code snippet is vulnerable due to the use of `snprintf` with a fixed-size buffer `pathName` without proper bounds checking. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the `destFileName` contains more than 4095 characters, including the format specifier `%d`. The vulnerability arises when the `snprintf` function is called within the loop, as it does not account for the additional characters needed for the page number and the null terminator. This can potentially overwrite adjacent memory and lead to a denial of service (crash) or other unintended behavior.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the buffer size is sufficient to hold the formatted string, including the page number and the null terminator. You can use `snprintf` with a size of `sizeof(pathName) - 1` to prevent writing beyond the buffer's bounds. Additionally, you should check the return value of `snprintf` to ensure that the formatted string was successfully written to the buffer.

Here's an updated version of the vulnerable part of the code:

```cpp
for (int pageNo = firstPage; pageNo <= lastPage; pageNo++) {
    int written = snprintf(pathName, sizeof(pathName), destFileName, pageNo);
    if (written < 0 || written >= sizeof(pathName)) {
",1638,301,11.52696967124939
177826,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided C++ code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `sprintf` function call within the `extractPages` function. The issue is that the `destFileName` may not have enough space to hold the formatted string that includes the page number, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

Here's the vulnerable line:

```cpp
sprintf (pathName, destFileName, pageNo);
```

The `sprintf` function is used to format a string that includes the `destFileName` and the `pageNo`. If `destFileName` does not have enough space to hold the resulting string, it can cause a buffer overflow, which is a type of vulnerability that can lead to a denial of service (DoS) or even arbitrary code execution.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use a safer alternative like `snprintf`, which allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to be written to the buffer, thus preventing buffer overflows. Here's an example of how you can modify the code to use `snprintf`:

```cpp
int len = snprintf(pathName, sizeof(pathName), ""%s%d"", destFileName, pageNo);
if (len < 0 || (len >= sizeof(pathName))) {

The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to the way it handles XML parsing. The vulnerability is related to XML External Entities (XXE), which can be exploited to read arbitrary files on the server. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code allows the XML parser to load external entities, which can be used by an attacker to craft a malicious XML document that causes the parser to read sensitive files from the server's file system.

In the code snippet, the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` function is used to create a parser context for the given filename. If the filename contains a reference to an external entity, the parser will attempt to load it, potentially leading to the XXE vulnerability.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should ensure that the XML parser is configured to disallow the loading of external entities. In PHP, you can do this by setting the `libxml_disable_entity_loader` function to `true` before parsing the XML document. This will prevent the parser from loading external entities and thus protect against XXE attacks.

Here's an example of how to disable external entities in PHP:

```cpp
libxml_disable_entity_loader(true);
xmlDocPtr ret = soap_xmlParseFile(filename);
libxml_disable_entity_loader(false);
```

The provided C++ code for `soap_xmlParseMemory` is vulnerable due to the presence of XML External Entity (XXE) issues. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `xmlParseDocument` function without proper validation or sanitization of the input XML data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious XML document that includes external entity references, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data or denial of service.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the provided CVE-ID (CVE-2013-1824) and CWE-ID (CWE-200). To mitigate this vulnerability, you should ensure that the XML parser is configured to disable the processing of external entities or that the input XML data is properly validated and sanitized before being parsed. Additionally, consider using a more secure XML parser library that is not susceptible to XXE attacks.",1567,210,8.21501612663269

The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to the way it handles XML parsing. The vulnerability is related to XML External Entities (XXE), which can be exploited to read arbitrary files on the server. The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the original code snippet you provided, where the `allow_url_fopen` setting is changed to allow opening URLs, which can be misused in the context of XML parsing.

In the provided code, the `allow_url_fopen` setting is changed to `1` to enable opening URLs. This setting is used by the XML parser to determine whether it should allow opening external entities or not. By default, this setting is disabled to prevent potential security risks.

The vulnerability arises when the XML parser encounters an external entity reference in the XML document being parsed. An attacker can craft a malicious XML document that includes an external entity reference pointing to a sensitive file on the server. When the parser processes this document, it will attempt to open the referenced file, leading to unauthorized file access.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `allow_url_fopen` setting is disabled or that the XML parser is configured to disallow external entities. Additionally, you should validate and sanitize all XML input to prevent XXE attacks.

The provided C++ code for the `minCost` function is not vulnerable to the same DoS vulnerability as the `arbitraryTransformMask` function. The `minCost` function implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the minimum cost of reaching each node in a graph, given the cost of traveling between nodes and a limit on the number of times a node can be visited (k).

177911,Exec Code Overflow," YES, the given code is vulnerable to an integer overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability lies in the following lines:

```cpp
length = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
p      = table + 16;
count  = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
```

In this code, `TT_NEXT_ULONG` is a macro that reads an unsigned long integer from the memory pointed by `p`. The vulnerability arises when the input `table` contains a large value for `length` and `count`, which can cause an integer overflow when performing arithmetic operations with these values.

For example, if `length` and `count` are large enough, the following line can cause an integer overflow:

```cpp
if ( table + length > valid->limit || length < 20 + count * 2 )
```

This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by crafting a malicious input that triggers the overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the values of `length` and `count` are within a safe range and perform proper bounds checking to prevent integer overflows. Additionally, you can use a safer integer type, such as `int64_t`, to handle large values and avoid overflows.",1304,292,11.20151424407959

The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to the potential for an out-of-bounds write, similar to the vulnerability described in the CVE-ID CVE-2018-14600. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `rep.length` variable, which is assumed to be a signed integer, in the calculation of `rlen`. If `rep.length` is negative, the calculation of `rlen` will result in an incorrect value, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write when reading from the buffer pointed to by `ch`.

In the code, `rlen = rep.length << 2;` is used to calculate the size of the buffer for `ch`. If `rep.length` is negative, this will result in a smaller buffer size than intended, which can lead to out-of-bounds writes when `_XReadPad` is called with `rlen` as the size argument. This can cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to a denial of service or remote code execution.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that `rep.length` is a non-negative value before using it in the calculation of `rlen`. Additionally, the code should perform bounds checking when accessing the buffer pointed to by `ch` to prevent out-of-bounds reads and writes.",1895,291,11.487145185470581

In the provided code, there is no direct handling of floating-point numbers or NaN values. The code is a C++ function that calculates the minimum cost of reaching each node in a graph, given the cost of apples at each node and the cost of traveling between nodes. The function uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path and does not involve any operations that could lead to a NaN vulnerability.

177923,Bypass," YES

The provided C++ code for the `move_uploaded_file` function is vulnerable due to the same Bypass.cpp vulnerability as mentioned in the original code snippet. The vulnerability arises from the handling of file paths that contain null bytes (`\x00`).

In the code, the `zend_parse_parameters` function is used to parse the `path` and `new_path` arguments. However, the code does not perform any validation or sanitization on these paths. This means that an attacker can pass a path containing a null byte, which will cause the PHP engine to truncate the path at that point.

As a result, the file may be moved to an unexpected location, potentially allowing the attacker to bypass intended extension restrictions and create files with unexpected names. This vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-7243, as mentioned in the original code snippet.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the `path` and `new_path` arguments to ensure that they do not contain null bytes or other unexpected characters.
