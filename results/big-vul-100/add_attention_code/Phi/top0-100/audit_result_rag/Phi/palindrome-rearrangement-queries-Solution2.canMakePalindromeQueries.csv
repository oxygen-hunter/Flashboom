The provided C++ code does not appear to be vulnerable to the DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow_Mem._Corr. vulnerability described in the context. The code is a function that converts a string representing a time in the ASN.1 UTC time format to a `time_t` value, which is a standard way to represent time in C++. The function uses standard C++ library functions like `atoi` and `mktime` to parse and convert the time string.

The vulnerability mentioned in the context is related to the handling of X.509 certificates and the parsing of timestamps within them. The provided code does not deal with X.509 certificates or their timestamps, but rather with a simple time string conversion. Therefore, it does not exhibit the same vulnerability.

However, it is important to note that the code could be improved for better error handling and to avoid potential issues with the use of `atoi`, which does not provide error checking. Using `strtol` or `std::stoi` (from C++ standard library) would be safer alternatives. But as for the specific vulnerability mentioned, the code is not affected by it.",2573,262,10.704365491867065

The provided C++ code for `poppler_page_prepare_output_dev` is not vulnerable to the DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability described in CVE-2009-3605. The vulnerability in the original code was due to integer overflows when calculating the `cairo_width` and `cairo_height` which could lead to a buffer overflow when allocating memory for `cairo_data`.

In the revised code, the calculation of `cairo_width` and `cairo_height` is done using the `ceil` function, which ensures that the values are rounded up to the nearest integer. This prevents the integer overflow that could occur if the scale factor is large enough to cause the multiplication result to exceed the maximum value of an integer.

Additionally, the revised code uses `gmalloc` to allocate memory for `cairo_data`, which is a safer alternative to `malloc` as it can handle large allocations more gracefully. However, it's important to note that the actual safety of `gmalloc` would depend on its implementation, which is not provided here.

However, without additional context on the size of the image data structure and the values of `image->width` and `image->height`, it is not possible to definitively say that there is no vulnerability. If the image data structure is not large enough to hold the result of the multiplication, then an overflow could still occur, leading to a buffer overflow when accessing the image pixels.

The provided C++ code for `datum_to_json` is not vulnerable to a DoS (Denial of Service) overflow. The code is designed to convert a PostgreSQL datum to a JSON string representation. It handles different data types (boolean, numeric, text, timestamp, and JSON/JSONB) and escapes the text appropriately. The code also checks for NULL values and handles them by returning a JSON null.

The code does not have any obvious vulnerabilities that would lead to a DoS overflow. It uses PostgreSQL's built-in functions and checks for NULL values, which are standard practices for handling data in PostgreSQL. The code also uses `pfree` to free the allocated memory, which is a good practice to prevent memory leaks.

However, it is essential to note that the code's security and performance depend on the context in which it is used and the PostgreSQL version. The CVE-ID mentioned (CVE-2015-5289) is related to a different vulnerability in PostgreSQL's JSON parsing in versions prior to 9.4.10 and 9.3.21. The provided code does not directly relate to that vulnerability.

In conclusion, the provided `datum_to_json` code is not vulnerable to a DoS overflow based on the information given.",4721,301,12.690724611282349

The provided code snippet for `setPath` does not appear to be vulnerable to the DoS_Overflow vulnerability described in CVE-2015-5289. The vulnerability in the original code was due to improper handling of certain JSON parsing cases, which could lead to a denial of service. However, the code snippet you've provided does not involve JSON parsing directly and does not exhibit the same pattern of vulnerability.

The `setPath` function is a helper function that seems to be part of a larger JSON parsing or processing system, but without the context of how it's used or the complete implementation of the JSON parsing logic, it's not possible to definitively say whether the entire system is vulnerable or not. The code snippet itself, as presented, does not contain any buffer overflows or similar issues that would lead to a DoS vulnerability.

It's important to note that vulnerabilities can be context-dependent, and a function that is not vulnerable on its own might be part of a vulnerable system if it interacts with other parts of the code in a certain way. However, based on the information provided and the code snippet alone, there is no evidence of a DoS_Overflow vulnerability in the `setPath` function.",2213,276,11.133981704711914
