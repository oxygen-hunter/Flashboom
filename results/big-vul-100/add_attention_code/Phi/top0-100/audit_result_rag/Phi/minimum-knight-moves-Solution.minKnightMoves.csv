The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow_Mem._Corr. vulnerability described in the CVE-ID CVE-2013-6420. The code is a function that converts a time string in the ASN.1 UTCTIME format to a time_t value, which is a standard way to represent time in C. The function uses standard C library functions like snprintf, atoi, and mktime, which are not inherently vulnerable to the described issue.

The described vulnerability in the original code snippet was related to improper parsing of time strings in X.509 certificates, which could lead to memory corruption or arbitrary code execution. However, the provided code snippet does not involve parsing X.509 certificates or any other external input that could be manipulated by an attacker. It simply converts a time string to a time_t value, and the input is controlled and not derived from an external source.

Therefore, the provided code snippet does not exhibit the vulnerability described in the CVE-ID CVE-2013-6420.",2561,257,10.555109739303589

The provided code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The vulnerability lies in the `gmalloc` function, which is a custom memory allocation function. The function is used to allocate memory for the `SplashColorPtr` and `Guchar` pointers, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the size of the allocated memory.

In the `drawImage` function, the `lookup` pointers are allocated using `gmalloc` without specifying the size of the memory to be allocated. This can lead to a situation where the allocated memory is smaller than the actual size required by the program, causing a buffer overflow when the program tries to write to the allocated memory.

To fix this vulnerability, the `gmalloc` function should be modified to perform bounds checking on the size of the allocated memory, or the `drawImage` function should use a safer memory allocation function that performs bounds checking, such as `malloc` or `calloc` from the C standard library.",4643,209,9.153690099716187

The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of the `fwrite` function without proper bounds checking. In the `do_ed_script` function, the `fwrite` function is used to write the contents of `buf` to the temporary file `tmpfp`. However, the size of `buf` is not checked against the size of the file descriptor `tmpfp`. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the size of `buf` exceeds the available space in the file descriptor.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the size of `buf` does not exceed the available space in the file descriptor before calling `fwrite`. You can use the `fwrite` function with the `size` parameter to specify the maximum number of bytes to be written to the file descriptor.

Here's an example of how you can modify the code to fix the vulnerability:

```cpp
if (! fwrite(buf, sizeof *buf, chars_read, tmpfp))
    write_fatal();
```

becomes:

```cpp
if (! fwrite(buf, sizeof *buf, std::min(chars_read, sizeof(buf)), tmpfp))

The provided code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the potential for an infinite loop in the `minKnightMoves` function. The function calculates the minimum number of moves a knight must make to reach a given position on a chessboard. However, the logic used to calculate the moves is flawed, which can lead to an infinite loop for certain input values.

The vulnerability arises from the following line of code:

```cpp
return k - 2 * ((k - y) / 4);
```

In this line, the division operation `((k - y) / 4)` can result in a non-integer value when `k` and `y` are not multiples of 4. Since the result of the division is then multiplied by -2 and subtracted from `k`, the final result may not be an integer, which is not a valid input for the `unordered_map` lookup table.

This can lead to an infinite loop when the function is called with input values that cause the division to result in a non-integer value. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the function with carefully chosen input values, causing the server to spend excessive resources on processing the function and potentially leading to a DoS condition.
