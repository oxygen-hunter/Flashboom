The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow_Mem._Corr. vulnerability described in the CVE-ID CVE-2013-6420. The code is a function that converts an ASN.1 UTCTIME structure to a time_t value, which is a standard operation in C++ for handling time. The function does not execute any external code or handle external input in a way that would be susceptible to buffer overflows or memory corruption.

The function takes a pointer to an ASN1_UTCTIME structure and processes it to convert the time string into a time_t value. It does not involve any operations that would lead to a denial of service or code execution vulnerability. The function uses standard C++ library functions like snprintf, memset, and mktime, which are not inherently vulnerable to the described issue.

The function also includes a check to ensure that the length of the time string is at least 13 characters, which is the expected length for a valid time string in the ASN.1 UTCTIME format. This check helps prevent buffer overflows by ensuring that the input is of the correct length before processing it.

Additionally, the function does not involve any dynamic memory allocation or deallocation that could lead to memory corruption. The memory allocated for",2515,301,12.18968653678894

The provided code for `decode_openldap_dereference` does not appear to be vulnerable to the DoS (Denial of Service) issue described in the CVE-ID CVE-2015-7540. The vulnerability in the original code was due to not checking the return values of memory allocation functions, which could lead to a denial of service if an attacker crafted packets to exploit this.

In the provided code snippet, there are no memory allocation functions like `malloc` or `taloc` that are not checked for their return values. The code uses `taloc_realloc` and `talloc_zero`, but it is not clear from the snippet whether these functions are safe or not. However, the description of the vulnerability does not mention these functions, and without further context or the implementation of these functions, we cannot definitively say that the code is vulnerable.

Moreover, the second code snippet provided is a completely different function (`maxMoves`) that does not seem to be related to the LDAP server or the ASN.1 decoding process.
