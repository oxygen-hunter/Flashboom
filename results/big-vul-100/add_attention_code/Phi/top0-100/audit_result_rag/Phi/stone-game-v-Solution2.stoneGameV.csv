The provided code for `extractPages` is vulnerable due to a stack-based buffer overflow. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `sprintf` function without proper bounds checking. The `pathName` buffer is statically allocated with a size of 1024 bytes, but the `sprintf` function is used to format the string with the page number, which can exceed the buffer size if the page number is large enough. This can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-ID CVE-2013-4473, where a stack-based buffer overflow in the `extractPages` function in the `poppler` library allowed for a denial of service and possibly arbitrary code execution.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use a safer alternative to `sprintf`, such as `snprintf`, which allows specifying the maximum number of characters to be written to the buffer, including the null terminator. Here's an example of how to fix the vulnerability:

```cpp
for (int pageNo = firstPage; pageNo <= lastPage; pageNo++) {
    int written = snprintf(pathName, sizeof(pathName), ""%s%d"", destFileName, pageNo);

The provided code for the `stoneGameV` function is not vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. The function implements a dynamic programming approach to solve the Stone Game V problem, which involves calculating the maximum score a player can achieve by picking stones from a row of stones with different values. The function does not involve any network communication, file I/O, or other operations that could be exploited to cause a denial of service.",3758,99,4.667845010757446
177906,DoS Exec Code Overflow," NO

The provided code for the `Splash::makeDashedPath` function does not appear to be vulnerable to the DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability described in the CVE-ID CWE-119. The function is a path drawing algorithm that creates a dashed line path based on a given path and a set of line dashes. It does not involve any operations that could lead to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution as described in the vulnerability.",3249,105,4.934008598327637

The provided C++ code for the `tt_cmap8_validate` function is not vulnerable to the Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability described in the CVE-2009-0946. The function is designed to validate a table of font data and does not execute any code or handle external input in a way that would lead to an overflow and subsequent code execution. The function checks the size of the input table and the structure of the data within it, but it does not perform operations that could lead to an overflow of the buffer.",2731,119,5.384449481964111
177915,Exec Code Overflow," NO

The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability described in the CVE-2009-0946. The code uses safe operations and does not exhibit behavior that would lead to an integer overflow or arbitrary code execution.",2281,62,2.968390703201294

The provided code for `XListFonts` does not exhibit the same vulnerability as described in the CVE-2018-14599. The vulnerability in the original code was due to an off-by-one error in the handling of the `req->length` and the subsequent memory operations. The provided code correctly calculates the length and allocates memory based on the actual length of the data received from the server.

The `stoneGameV` function is unrelated to the `XListFonts` function and does not affect its vulnerability.",2579,127,5.627126693725586

The provided C++ code for the `move_uploaded_file` function does not appear to be vulnerable to the Bypass vulnerability described in CVE-2015-2348. The vulnerability in the original PHP code was due to the handling of null bytes in the file path, which allowed attackers to bypass file extension restrictions. The provided code does not contain any file path manipulation or handling that would introduce a similar vulnerability.",2061,102,4.540983438491821
