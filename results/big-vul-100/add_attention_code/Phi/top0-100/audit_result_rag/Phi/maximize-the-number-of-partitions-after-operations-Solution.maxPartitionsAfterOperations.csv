The provided C++ code snippet for `asn1_time_to_time_t` function does not appear to be vulnerable to the DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow_Mem._Corr. vulnerability described in the CVE-ID CVE-2013-6420. The vulnerability in the original code was due to improper parsing of ASN.1 time strings, which could lead to memory corruption or arbitrary code execution.

In the modified code snippet, the parsing of the time string is done correctly by working backwards and using `atoi` to convert the string to integers. The code also checks the length of the input string and returns an error if it is less than 13 characters. Additionally, the code handles the conversion of the year correctly by adding 100 to the year if it is less than 68.

The `maxPartitionsAfterOperations` function provided is unrelated to the `asn1_time_to_time_t` function and does not appear to be vulnerable to the mentioned vulnerability. It is a separate function that calculates the maximum number of partitions after performing certain operations on a string.

The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the DoS_Exec_Code vulnerability described in the CVE-ID CVE-2018-1000039. The code is a function for handling soft masks in a PDF processing context, and it does not contain any obvious buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, or other common vulnerabilities that could lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.

The function `begin_softmask` is responsible for setting up a soft mask for PDF content, which is a mechanism used to apply transparency effects. The function checks if the `softmask` pointer is `NULL` and handles it accordingly. It also sets up a `fz_colorspace` pointer based on the `softmask` and the `luminosity` flag.

The function then enters a `fz_try` block to handle potential errors during the masking operations. If an error occurs, it is caught and handled by setting the `fz_colorspace` to `NULL` and rethrowing the error. This error handling mechanism does not seem to be vulnerable to DoS or arbitrary code execution.
