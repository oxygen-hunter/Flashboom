The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `dir` parameter when it is a subdirectory. The code does not properly check the length of `dir` before using it in string operations. This can lead to an off-by-one error when the length of `dir` is not correctly accounted for, potentially causing a buffer overflow.

For example, in the following code snippet:

The vulnerability lies in the handling of file shrinkage during read access. When a file is being archived using the `--sparse` option, the code does not properly handle the case where the file size has been reduced (shrunk) by another process. This can lead to an infinite read loop in the `sparse_dump_region` function, causing a denial of service.

In the code, the `bytes_left` variable is decremented by the number of bytes read in each iteration of the while loop. However, if the file size has been reduced by another process during the read operation, the `bytes_left` variable will not be updated to reflect the new file size. This can cause the loop to continue indefinitely, as the `bytes_left` variable will never reach zero.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the file size before each read operation and update the `bytes_left` variable accordingly. This can be done by using the `fstat` system call to obtain the current file size and comparing it to the `bytes_left` variable. If the file size has been reduced, the `bytes_left` variable should be updated to reflect the new file size. This will ensure that the loop terminates when the entire file has been read, even if the file size has been reduced during the read operation.",2156,299,12.158053874969482

The code allocates memory for `imgData.lookup` based on the number of pixel components (`colorMap->getNumPixelComps()`) and the number of bits per component (`colorMap->getBits()`). This allocation is done using `gmalloc`, which is a custom memory allocation function.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not check if the allocated memory size is within a safe range. If the number of bits per component is too large, the allocated memory size could be too large, leading to a potential integer overflow when calculating the size of the `imgData.lookup` array.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add proper input validation and error handling to ensure that the code does not access elements outside the bounds of the `openHtmlTags` vector and that the `tag` variable is always properly initialized before being used in comparisons.",723,228,8.748488664627075
177823,Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `code` variable when it is equal to `CLEAR` and `file->block_compress` is true. In this case, the code clears the `file->tab_prefix` array and sets `file->free_ent` to `FIRST - 1`. Then, it attempts to get a new code using `getcode(file)`. If `getcode(file)` returns -1, the function breaks out of the loop, which could lead to an incomplete decompression process.

However, the main issue is that the code does not properly handle the case when a code word is absent from the decompression table. This can lead to an infinite loop or a heap-based buffer overflow, as the function will keep trying to access non-existent entries in the table. This vulnerability allows an attacker to craft a compressed stream that triggers the vulnerability, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it handles the conversion of UTF16 characters to codepoints. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly validate the length of the output buffer (`outbuf`) before performing the `smb_iconv` conversion. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the output buffer is not large enough to hold the converted data.

In the code, `outbuf` is initially set to point to `buf`, which is a local array of size 4. The `smb_iconv` function is then called twice, first with `olen` set to 2 and then with `olen` set to 4. If the conversion results in more than 4 bytes being written to `outbuf`, it will overflow the bounds of `buf`, leading to a potential buffer overflow vulnerability.

This vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious input that causes the `smb_iconv` function to write more than 4 bytes to `outbuf`, potentially allowing an attacker to read sensitive information from the daemon's heap memory.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the output buffer is large enough to hold the converted data before calling `smb_iconv`. Additionally, the code should validate the length of the output buffer and handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during the conversion process.",1735,300,11.634050130844116

The vulnerability lies in the handling of the string length and the escape character logic. The function `ldb_dn_escape_internal` is designed to escape certain characters in a string, but it does not properly handle the case where the input string `src` is longer than the specified length `len`. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is not properly null-terminated or if it contains more characters than expected.

Additionally, the escape character logic is flawed. The function attempts to escape certain characters, but the logic for escaping characters at the beginning or end of the string is duplicated and incorrect. The code snippet provided has a `break` statement after the `if` block that should only be executed if the character is not a space. However, the `break` statement is outside of the `if` block, which means it will always be executed, causing the loop to exit prematurely.

Moreover, the function does not check for the null-terminator of the input string, which can lead to reading beyond the end of the string if `len` is not accurate. This can result in undefined behavior and potential information disclosure if the function is used in a context where it is expected to handle strings of a certain length.

The function `strlen_m_ext_handle` is designed to calculate the length of a string in a specific character set. However, the code does not perform bounds checking on the input string `s` before it is processed. This can lead to a situation where the function reads beyond the end of the allocated memory for the string, which is a classic buffer overflow vulnerability.

In the context of the vulnerability summary provided (CVE-2015-5330), the issue is that the function mishandles string lengths, which can allow an attacker to read sensitive information from the daemon's heap memory. While the provided code snippet does not directly show the interaction with the AD LDAP server or the crafting of packets, the underlying problem of mishandling string lengths and potential buffer overflows is present.

The function assumes that the input string `s` is well-formed and does not contain any null bytes (`'\0'`) before the actual end of the string. If an attacker can control the input and provide a string that is shorter than expected or contains null bytes at unexpected positions, the function may read beyond the intended memory area, leading to a buffer overflow.

The provided C++ code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to a potential buffer overflow in the `json_to_json` function.

If the output from this function call exceeds the size of the `outputstr` buffer, it could lead to a buffer overflow.

In the case of a buffer overflow, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a JSON numeric value that is larger than the allocated buffer size. This could potentially overwrite adjacent memory, leading to a crash or allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the `outputstr` buffer is allocated with a sufficient size to hold the maximum possible output from `OidOutputFunctionCall(outfuncoid, val)`.

The code is vulnerable because it uses a shell command to execute the editor program, which can be manipulated to execute arbitrary commands. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `execl` function with a string that is constructed from user-controlled input (the `buf` variable). If an attacker can control the contents of `buf`, they can inject additional shell commands to be executed.

In the code, the `buf` variable is constructed with the editor program name and the output file name. If an attacker can control the output file name, they can inject shell metacharacters or additional commands into `buf`. For example, an attacker could provide an output file name like `; rm -rf /`, which would result in the command being executed as `/bin/sh -c ""/bin/sh; rm -rf /""`. This would cause the shell to execute the `rm -rf /` command, potentially leading to a complete system wipe.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer method to execute the editor program, such as using the `execvp` function with a fixed command and arguments, or using a library that provides a safe way to execute external commands with user-controlled input.",2538,267,10.904670715332031
177857,nan," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the way the code handles the allocation of memory for the buffer. The code uses the `malloc` function to allocate memory based on the file size (`instat.st_size`). However, the code does not check if the file size is a valid size that can be represented by a `size_t` type. This can lead to a situation where the file size is larger than the maximum value that can be represented by a `size_t`, causing an integer overflow.

When an integer overflow occurs, the resulting buffer size may be smaller than the actual file size, leading to a buffer overflow when the file is read into the buffer. This can result in the overwriting of adjacent memory, potentially leading to a crash or allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

Additionally, the code does not check if the `malloc` call was successful. If `malloc` fails to allocate the requested memory, it will return a null pointer. In this case, the code will proceed to use the null pointer as a buffer, which can also lead to a crash or other undefined behavior.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the file size is within the valid range of a `size_t` before allocating memory. It should also check if `malloc` returns a non-null pointer before using the allocated memory.",1065,293,11.266597270965576

The provided code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly check the length of the input before processing it. The `aes_crypt_ecb` function assumes that the input is always 16 bytes long, as indicated by the `unsigned char input[16]` parameter. However, if the function is called with an input of a different length, it could lead to a buffer overflow when the `GET_ULONG_LE` macro is used to read the input into the `X0` variable.

A buffer overflow occurs when more data is written to a buffer than it can hold, causing the excess data to overwrite adjacent memory locations. In this case, if the input is longer than 16 bytes, the excess bytes could overwrite the `RK` pointer, which is used later in the function to access the round keys. This could lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or even allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

The function `check_file_permissions_reduced` is designed to check if a given file name is allowed based on a list of permitted file names or patterns. However, the code does not properly sanitize or validate the input file name (`fname`) before performing the permission checks.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not check if the input file name contains any special characters or sequences that could be used to bypass the permission checks. For example, an attacker could provide a file name that contains a sequence of characters that matches a permitted pattern, but is actually pointing to a different file or directory.

In the provided code, the function `gp_file_name_parents` is used to count the number of parent references (e.g., ""../"") in the input file name. If the number of parent references in the input file name does not match the number of parent references in the permission string, the function continues to the next permission string in the list.

In this line, the code checks if the requested size is greater than the remaining memory limit minus the size of a `gs_malloc_block_t` structure. However, if the `mmem->limit` is a large value and the `size` is a small value, the subtraction operation can result in a negative value. This negative value is then compared with `size`, which is a positive value, and the condition will always be true, leading to an incorrect allocation.

This vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a Postscript file that requests a large allocation size, causing the function to allocate more memory than intended and potentially leading to a denial of service (crash) or other unintended behavior.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to ensure that the subtraction operation does not result in a negative value.

Lastly, the code does not check if the pointers `srcData`, `dest`, and `destPtr` are valid before using them. If any of these pointers are null or point to invalid memory, it could lead to a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior.

177911,Exec Code Overflow," YES, the code is vulnerable to an integer overflow.

The vulnerability arises from the way the code calculates the `length` and `count` variables without proper bounds checking. The `length` is obtained by reading an unsigned long from the `table` pointer, and then the pointer is incremented by 16 bytes to get the `count`. However, the code does not check if the `table + 16` is within the bounds of the input data before using it to calculate the `count`. This can lead to an integer overflow if the input data is not properly padded or if the input is crafted maliciously.

Additionally, the code does not check if the `length` is a valid size for the input data before attempting to read `count` from the `table`. If the `length` is larger than the actual size of the input data, this can also lead to an integer overflow when calculating the `count`.

These integer overflows can be exploited to cause the program to read or write outside the bounds of the input data, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other security issues.",819,240,9.185810089111328
177912,Exec Code Overflow," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the way the code calculates the length of the input table and the number of groups. The code assumes that the input table has a specific structure and that the values at certain offsets are valid. However, if an attacker can control the input table, they may be able to craft a table that causes an integer overflow when calculating the length or the number of groups.

For example, if an attacker can control the value at offset 4 (which is used to calculate the length), they could set it to a very large value, causing an integer overflow when adding 16 to it. This would result in a negative value for the length, which would cause the code to skip the length check and potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

Similarly, if an attacker can control the values at offsets 12 and 16 (which are used to calculate the number of groups), they could set them to values that cause an integer overflow when calculating the number of groups. This could result in a negative value for the number of groups, which would cause the code to skip the loop that checks the groups and potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should perform bounds checking on the values read from the input table to ensure that they are within the expected range. Additionally, the code should use a sa",1067,301,11.543074607849121

The provided code is vulnerable to an integer overflow in the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` function calls. This function is used to read 4-byte unsigned long integers from the `table` array. If the `table` array contains values that, when interpreted as unsigned long integers, exceed the maximum value that can be represented by an unsigned long (which is typically 2^32 - 1 or 4,294,967,295), the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` function will wrap around and produce incorrect values.

This can lead to incorrect calculations of `length`, `num_groups`, `start`, `end`, and `start_id`, which are used to validate the data structure. If these values are incorrect, the code may allow invalid or malformed data to pass validation, potentially leading to a buffer overflow or other vulnerabilities when the data is used later in the program.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-ID CVE-2009-0946, where integer overflows in FreeType 2.3.9 and earlier versions allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to large values in certain inputs.",2105,265,10.86136531829834
177915,Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided code is vulnerable to an integer overflow, which can lead to an Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability lies in the following lines:

```cpp
if ( FT_READ_USHORT( nleft ) )
  goto Exit;

if ( FT_READ_BYTE( nleft ) )
  goto Exit;
```

In these lines, the code reads the number of glyphs in the range (nleft) using FT_READ_USHORT or FT_READ_BYTE functions. If the value of nleft is too large to be stored in a USHORT or BYTE, it can cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect value being assigned to nleft.

This incorrect value can then be used in the subsequent loop:

```cpp
for ( i = 0; j < num_glyphs && i <= nleft; i++, j++, glyph_sid++ )
  charset->sids[j] = glyph_sid;
```

If nleft is larger than the actual number of glyphs in the range, the loop may access memory outside the bounds of the sids array, leading to a buffer overflow. This can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by overwriting memory locations.

177917,Exec Code," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the way the function `_XReadPad` is used to read data from the display into the buffer `ch`. The function `_XReadPad` is used to read a specified number of bytes from the display into the buffer. However, the code does not check if the number of bytes requested (`nbytes`) is less than or equal to the size of the buffer `ch`. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the requested number of bytes is greater than the size of the buffer.

In the provided code, the buffer `ch` is allocated with `nbytes + 1` bytes to leave room for the null-terminator. However, if the `rep.length` is greater than `INT_MAX / 2`, the `nbytes` will be calculated as `(unsigned long) rep.length << 2`, which can potentially be larger than the size of the buffer `ch`. This can lead to a buffer overflow when `_XReadPad` tries to read more bytes into the buffer than it can hold.

177918,Exec Code," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the line where the length of the extension is read and used to determine the end of the string:

```c
length = *ch;
```

In the original vulnerable code, the length was stored as a signed integer, which could lead to an out-of-bounds write if the length was negative. However, in the provided code snippet, the length is stored as an unsigned integer, which should prevent the specific issue mentioned in the CVE-ID CVE-2018-14600.

However, the vulnerability still exists due to the way the length is used to determine the end of the string. The code assumes that the length is always followed by a null-terminator, which may not be the case. If the length is not followed by a null-terminator, the code will read past the end of the buffer when it tries to find the next length, leading to a potential out-of-bounds write.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the length is always followed by a null-terminator, or it should use a safer method to determine the end of the string, such as using `strnlen` or `strncat` functions.",1410,275,10.729601621627808

The provided code is vulnerable due to the potential for an off-by-one error in the handling of the `chend` pointer. The vulnerability arises from the assumption that the length of the font name plus one (for the null terminator) will always fit within the allocated buffer `ch`. If the server response contains a length that, when added to the buffer's starting address, exceeds the buffer's bounds, it could lead to a buffer overflow. This can result in a denial of service (DoS) or potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, depending on the system's memory layout and other factors.

The specific line that could lead to this vulnerability is:

```c
chend = ch + (rlen + 1);
```

If `rlen` is larger than the actual length of the data being read, it could cause `chend` to point outside the allocated buffer. The subsequent loop that copies data from `ch` to `flist` does not check if `ch + length` is within the bounds of `chend` before copying, which could lead to reading or writing beyond the allocated memory.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the buffer bounds are respected when copying data. This could involve adding additional checks to ensure that `ch + length` does not exceed `chend` before performing the copy operation",1953,301,12.08561372756958
177920,nan," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the way the code handles the buffer allocated for reading the font paths. The code assumes that the length of each path is correctly specified in the response from the server. However, if the server sends a malicious response with incorrect lengths, the code may read beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

In the code, the variable `length` is set to the first byte of the buffer `ch`, which is supposed to contain the length of the first path. The code then reads the path and skips over the length, but it does not check if the buffer `ch` has enough space to store the path. If the server sends a path that is longer than the allocated buffer, this will result in a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the way the code handles the buffer `param_buffer`. The buffer is statically allocated with a fixed size of 1024 bytes. The code does not properly check the length of the input before copying it into the buffer. If the input string is longer than 1023 characters (plus the null terminator), it will cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to a crash or, in a worst-case scenario, arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the provided CVE-ID CVE-2EE-11360, where a buffer overflow in iptables-restore in netfilter iptables 1.8.2 allows an attacker to crash the program or potentially gain code execution via a specially crafted iptables-save file.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly check the length of the input string and ensure that it does not exceed the size of the buffer before copying it. Additionally, using safer functions like `strncpy` or `snprintf` can help prevent buffer overflows.",1837,247,9.758588790893555

The provided C++ code for the `move_uploaded_file` function is vulnerable to the Bypass vulnerability (CVE-2015-2348, CWE-264) due to the same reason as the original PHP code snippet. The vulnerability arises from the handling of the `path` and `new_path` parameters, which are parsed and used without proper sanitization or validation to prevent the inclusion of null bytes (`\x00`). This allows an attacker to bypass file extension restrictions by crafting a `new_path` that includes a null byte followed by a different file extension, potentially leading to the creation of files with unexpected names and locations.",1435,154,6.127869606018066
177926,Exec Code Overflow," YES, the code is still vulnerable.

The vulnerability arises from the potential for an integer overflow when calculating the size of the buffer needed to store the decoded base64 data. The line `img_data = g_try_malloc0 (base64_len * 3 / 4);` calculates the size of the buffer by dividing the length of the base64 data by 4 (since base64 encoding represents every 4 characters as 3 bytes) and then multiplying by 3. If `base64_len` is very large, this multiplication could overflow the `gsize` type, leading to a smaller buffer being allocated than is needed.

When the `g_base64_decode_step` function is called, it may write more data into `img_data` than the allocated buffer can hold, causing a heap-based buffer overflow. This overflow can lead to undefined behavior, including the potential for arbitrary code execution, which is the essence of the CVE-2009-0586 vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the buffer size calculation does not overflow and that the buffer is large enough to hold the decoded data. Additionally, the code should check the return value of `g_base64_decode_step` to ensure that the decoding was successful and that the buffer was not overrun",1412,301,11.625463485717773
