177826,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided C++ code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `sprintf` function call within the `extractPages` function. The `sprintf` function is used to format the `pathName` string, which is then used to create a `GooString` object. The issue arises because the `sprintf` function does not perform bounds checking on the size of the buffer `pathName`. If the `destFileName` contains more than 1023 characters (plus the null terminator), it will cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to a DoS (Denial of Service) or even arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the input.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the provided code snippet, where a stack-based buffer overflow can occur due to improper bounds checking when formatting strings.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use a safer alternative like `snprintf`, which allows specifying the maximum number of characters to be written to the buffer, including the null terminator. Here's an example of how you can modify the code to use `snprintf`:

```cpp
for (int pageNo = firstPage; pageNo <= lastPage; pageNo++) {
    int written = snprintf(pathName, sizeof(pathName), ""%s%d"", destFileName, pageNo);

The provided code for `findMedianSortedArrays` does not exhibit the vulnerabilities listed in the CVE-ID CVE-2013-1788, which are related to DoS and potential arbitrary code execution due to invalid memory access. The function is designed to find the median of two sorted arrays and does not involve any operations that could lead to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution. It uses binary search and mergesort-like techniques to find the median, which are safe operations in this context.",3143,117,5.230813503265381

The provided C++ code for `findMedianSortedArrays` does not contain the same vulnerability as the `tt_cmap12_validate` function. The `findMedianSortedArrays` function is designed to find the median of two sorted arrays and does not involve operations that could lead to an integer overflow or underflow. It uses binary search and does not manipulate pointers or memory in a way that could lead to buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues.",1587,105,4.272285461425781

The provided code for `findMedianSortedArrays` does not contain a vulnerability related to the 'nan' issue described in the initial prompt. The function is designed to find the median of two sorted arrays by using binary search and finding the kth smallest element. It does not involve any operations that could lead to a 'nan' vulnerability, such as unchecked arithmetic operations or buffer overflows.",2473,88,3.939584970474243

The provided C++ code for finding the median of two sorted arrays is not vulnerable to the Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability described in the initial code snippet. The vulnerability in the initial code snippet is related to the handling of a buffer in a function that parses command-line arguments. The provided C++ code for finding the median of two sorted arrays does not involve parsing command-line arguments or handling buffers in a way that could lead to a buffer overflow.",2357,101,4.420109272003174

The provided C++ code for finding the median of two sorted arrays is not vulnerable to the specific vulnerability described in the CWE-754-Numeric-Underflow. The code does not perform any operations that could lead to a numeric underflow. It uses standard library functions and safe arithmetic operations that are designed to handle edge cases properly.",4087,76,3.8416991233825684
