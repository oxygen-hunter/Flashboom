The vulnerability arises from the use of the `sprintf` function in the following line:

The `sprintf` function is used to format the `pathName` string by inserting the `pageNo` variable into the `destFileName` string. However, the `pathName` buffer has a fixed size of 1024 bytes, and there is no check to ensure that the resulting string does not exceed this size. If the `destFileName` string and the `pageNo` variable together produce a string longer than 1024 bytes, it will cause a stack-based buffer overflow.
