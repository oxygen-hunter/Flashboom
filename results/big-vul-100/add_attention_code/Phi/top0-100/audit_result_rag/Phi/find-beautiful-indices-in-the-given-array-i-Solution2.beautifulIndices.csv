The provided code is vulnerable due to a potential buffer overflow. The function `estrdup` is used to duplicate the string pointed to by `timestr->data` into `strbuf`. However, there is no check to ensure that the size of `strbuf` is large enough to hold the duplicated string, including the null terminator. If the size of the string pointed to by `timestr->data` exceeds the size of `strbuf`, this could lead to a buffer overflow, which is a type of memory corruption vulnerability.

Buffer overflows can lead to various security issues, including the execution of arbitrary code, crashes, and other unintended behavior. In this case, if an attacker can control the input to `timestr->data`, they might be able to exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that `strbuf` is allocated with a size that can safely hold the duplicated string, including the null terminator. Additionally, it would be prudent to add error checking after the `estrdup` call to handle the case where the allocation fails.",2054,251,10.156620264053345
177741,DoS Overflow," YES

The provided code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, similar to the original vulnerable function. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the size of the buffer `session_data` is determined by the value of `psession.size`, which is obtained from the session data. If a malicious TLS server sends a large `SessionTicket` that exceeds the allocated buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow when copying the session data to `session_data`.

The vulnerability is present because the code does not check if the size of the data to be copied (`psession.size`) is less than or equal to the size of the buffer pointed to by `session_data`. This can lead to a buffer overflow when the `memcpy` function is called, potentially causing a denial of service (application crash) or other security issues.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the size of the data to be copied does not exceed the size of the buffer pointed to by `session_data`. This can be done by adding an additional check before the `memcpy` call, similar to the check for `psession.size > *session_data_size`.",1319,253,9.708880424499512

The provided C++ code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, similar to the vulnerability in the original `gnutls_session_get_data` function. The vulnerability arises from the following line:

```

In this line, the code copies `psession.size` bytes from `psession.data` to `session_data`. If `psession.size` is larger than the size of `session_data`, this will result in a buffer overflow, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) or other security issues.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that `psession.size` does not exceed the size of `session_data` before performing the `memcpy` operation. You can do this by adding a check before the `memcpy` line:

```cpp
if (psession.size > *session_data_size) {
    ret = GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER;
    goto error;

The provided code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the potential for a resource exhaustion issue. Specifically, the `beautifulIndices` function could be exploited by an attacker to cause a stack overflow or excessive memory consumption.

The vulnerability arises from the use of recursive lambda functions and the `KMP` function, which implements the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for string matching. The `KMP` function uses a recursive lambda function `getPrefix` to compute the prefix function for the pattern. This recursive lambda function could potentially cause a stack overflow if the input string is extremely long.

Additionally, the `beautifulIndices` function iterates over the results of the `KMP` function for both `a` and `b` strings, and performs a linear search on the `lookup` vector to find the matching indices. If the input strings `a` and `B` are very long, this could lead to excessive memory consumption and slow down the program, potentially causing a Denial of Service.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you could consider using an iterative approach to compute the prefix function instead of a recursive lambda function. You could also optimize the search for matching indices by using a more efficient algorithm or data structure.",4506,282,11.913691759109497

The provided C++ code snippet for the `SplashBitmap` constructor is vulnerable to integer overflow, which can lead to a buffer overflow when allocating memory for the `data` and `alpha` pointers. This vulnerability arises from the calculation of `rowSize` and the subsequent memory allocation using `gmalloc`.

In the code, `rowSize` is calculated based on the `mode` and then adjusted by `rowPad`. The memory allocation for `data` and `alpha` is then performed using `gmalloc(rowSize * height)` and `gmalloc(width * height)`, respectively. If `rowSize * height` or `width * height` exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the data type (typically `int`), an integer overflow can occur, leading to a smaller-than-expected allocation size.

When the `data` or `right` pointer is accessed beyond the allocated memory, it can cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to a denial of service (application crash) or even arbitrary code execution, depending on the system and compiler behavior.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the calculations for `rowSize`, `width * height`, and `rowSize * height` do not result in integer overflow.

The provided code snippet is vulnerable due to the way it calculates the length of the data buffer (`len`) and uses it in the `memcpy` operation. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the length of the data buffer is determined by the size of the `data` array (1024 bytes) and the size of the credentials added to the buffer. However, the actual size of the credentials is not explicitly checked or limited, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the credentials exceed the remaining space in the `data` buffer.

In the `nfs_readlink_req` function, the `len` variable is calculated as follows:

```cpp
len = p - &(data[0]);
```

This calculation assumes that the credentials added to the buffer (`p`) will not exceed the size of the `data` array (1024 bytes). However, if the credentials are larger than the remaining space in the `data` buffer, this could lead to a buffer overflow when the `memcpy` operation is performed.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the size of the credentials added to the buffer does not exceed the remaining space in the `data` buffer. You can do this by explicitly checking the size of the credentials and limiting it to the remaining space in the `data` buffer before performing the `memcpy` operation.",1704,297,11.475910663604736

The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to a stack-based buffer overflow in the `sprintf` function call within the `extractPages` function. The `sprintf` function is used to format the `pathName` string with the page number, but it does not perform bounds checking on the size of the buffer `pathName`. If the `destFileName` contains a format specifier `%d` and the page number is large enough, it could cause the `sprintf` to write more characters to `pathName` than it can hold, leading to a buffer overflow.

This vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS) as it may crash the program, and in some cases, it could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code, depending on the system and compiler specifics.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use a safer alternative like `snprintf` which allows specifying the maximum number of characters to be written to the buffer, thus preventing buffer overflows. Here's an example of how you could modify the code to use `snprintf`:

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, similar to the original vulnerable code. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `strncmp` function, which does not null-terminate the password string when it is truncated. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the password is longer than `SPICE_MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH`.

In the code, the `strncmp` function is called with the third argument as `SPICE_MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH`. If the actual length of `taTicket.password` is greater than `SPICE_MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH`, the `strncmp` function will not null-terminate the password string, potentially causing a buffer overflow when it is compared to the `password` buffer.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `strncmp` function is called with a null-terminated string. One way to do this is by using the `strnlen` function to determine the actual length of `taTicket.password` and then using `strncmp` with the actual length instead of `SPICE_MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH`.

The code is vulnerable due to the way it handles the execution of the `editor_program` command. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the command is constructed by concatenating the `editor_program` with the `outname` and potentially other arguments based on the `verbosity` flag. This command is then executed in a subshell using `execl`.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the provided code snippet, where the `ed` editor is used to execute arbitrary commands through crafted input.

177911,Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided C++ code is vulnerable to an integer overflow, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability lies in the following lines:

```cpp
length = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
p      = table + 16;
count  = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
```

In this code, the `length` and `count` variables are calculated based on the values read from the `table` array. If the values in the `table` array are too large, it can cause an integer overflow when calculating `length` and `count`. This overflow can lead to incorrect values for `length` and `count`, which in turn can cause the code to access memory outside the intended bounds of the `table` array.

When the code later accesses the `table` array using the potentially incorrect `length` and `count` values, it can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add checks to ensure that the values of `length` and `count` do not exceed the expected bounds. Additionally, you should validate the input data to ensure that it is within the expected range and does not contain any malicious content.",1295,292,11.148790836334229

The provided C++ code is vulnerable to an integer overflow. The vulnerability arises from the line:

```cpp
if ( table + length > valid->limit || length < 16 + 12 * num_groups )
```

Here, `length` is calculated as `TT_NEXT_ULONG(p)`, which reads an unsigned long value from the `table`. If the value of `length` is very large, adding it to `table` could cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect value for `table + length`. This could result in the function accessing memory outside the intended range, potentially causing a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issues.

Additionally, the calculation `16 + 12 * num_groups` could also lead to an integer overflow if `num_groups` is a very large value. This could result in an incorrect check for the `length` variable, allowing invalid data to pass the validation check.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the calculations involving `length` and `num_groups` do not cause integer overflows. You can use larger integer types or perform checks to ensure that the values do not exceed the maximum allowed values for the calculations.",1543,265,10.223994731903076

The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to a potential buffer overflow issue. The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles the reading of data into the `ch` buffer. The code assumes that the length of the data read from the display (`rep.length`) is less than `INT_MAX >> 2`, which is a condition to ensure that the buffer is large enough to hold the data plus a null terminator. However, if this condition is not met, the code attempts to allocate memory for `ch` based on `nbytes + 1`, which is derived from `rep.length`.

The vulnerability occurs if `rep.length` is larger than what the buffer can hold, leading to a buffer overflow when `_XReadPad` is called. This can result in overwriting adjacent memory, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) or other unspecified impacts.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the buffer size is always sufficient to hold the data plus a null terminator, and it should handle cases where the data size exceeds the buffer size appropriately, possibly by refusing to process the data or by using a larger buffer.",1829,255,9.98521637916565

The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to a potential buffer overflow in the `add_param_to_argv` function. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `param_buffer` array is statically allocated with a fixed size of 1024 bytes. If the input string `parsestart` is longer than 1023 characters (excluding the null terminator), the code will write past the end of the `param_buffer` array, leading to a buffer overflow.

This can result in memory corruption, causing the program to crash or, in the worst case, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-ID CVE-2019-11360, where a buffer overflow in iptables-restore in netfilter iptables 1.8.2 allowed an attacker to crash the program or potentially gain code execution via a specially crafted iptables-save file.

To fix this vulnerability, you should consider using a safer alternative to C-style strings, such as `std::string`, and ensure that the input size is checked before copying it to the buffer. Additionally, you can use functions like `std::string::reserve()` to allocate the necessary memory for the buffer based on the input size, preventing buffer overflows.",2313,300,12.136783361434937
