The provided code is vulnerable due to a potential buffer overflow. The function `asn1_right_to_time_t` assumes that the input string `timestr->data` is a valid ASN.1 time string and attempts to parse it without checking the length of the string. If the input string is longer than expected, the `strbuf` buffer may not be large enough to hold the entire string, leading to a buffer overflow when `strdup` is called. This can result in memory corruption and potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

Additionally, the function uses `atoi` to parse the time components from the string, which does not handle errors or invalid input gracefully. If the input string contains non-numeric characters or is malformed, the function may return incorrect values or cause undefined behavior.

To fix these vulnerabilities, the function should validate the input string length and content before parsing, and use safer string parsing functions that handle errors and invalid input more gracefully.",2006,217,8.784958362579346

The provided code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack, similar to the vulnerability in the original `gnutls_session_get_data` function. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly check the size of the `session_data` buffer before copying data into it. If an attacker can control the `psession.size` value, they could cause a buffer overflow by setting it to a value larger than the actual size of the `session_data` buffer provided. This could lead to a denial of service (application crash) or potentially allow arbitrary code execution, depending on the system and compiler used.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `session_data_size` is always correctly set to the size of the `session_data` buffer before calling this function. Additionally, you should add a check to ensure that `psession.size` does not exceed the `session_data_size` before performing the `memcpy` operation.",1271,214,8.2493257522583

The provided code snippet for `SplashBitmap::SplashBitmap` constructor is vulnerable to integer overflow, which can lead to a denial of service (DoS) or potentially arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability arises from the calculation of `rowSize` and the subsequent memory allocation using `gmalloc`.

In the code, `rowSize` is calculated based on the `mode` and the `width` of the bitmap. The calculation involves multiplication and addition, which can lead to integer overflow if the values of `width` and `rowSize` are large enough.

For example, in the case of `splashModeRGB8` or `splashModeBGR8`, `rowSize` is calculated as `width * 3`. If `width` is a large value, the multiplication can cause an integer overflow, resulting in an incorrect `rowSize` value.

Similarly, in the case of `splashModeXBGR8` or `splashModeCMYK8`, `rowSize` is calculated as `width * 4`. Again, if `width` is a large value, the multiplication can cause an integer overflow, resulting in an incorrect `rowSize` value.

After calculating `rowSize`, the code adds `rowPad - 1` to it and then subtracts the remainder of `rowSize` divided by `rowPad`. This can",1482,301,11.54694414138794

This length is then used to allocate memory for the `target` pointer without proper bounds checking.

The vulnerability is a buffer overflow, as the length of the data read from the network is used directly to allocate memory for the `target` pointer. If the length is larger than the size of the `data` array (1024 bytes), it will result in a buffer overflow, potentially leading to a crash or allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, proper bounds checking should be added to ensure that the length of the data read from the network does not exceed the size of the `data` array. Additionally, the code should handle the case where the length is larger than the size of the `data` array, either by truncating the data or by allocating a larger buffer.",1656,252,9.760390996932983

The vulnerability lies in the use of the `snprintf` function within the `extractPages` function. The `snprintf` function is used to format the `pathName` string with the page number, which is then used to create a `GooString` object. The issue arises when the `destFileName` does not contain the `%d` format specifier, and the user provides a filename that can be manipulated to cause a buffer overflow.

For example, if a user provides a filename like `../../../../etc/passwd`, the resulting `pathName` would be `../../../../etc/passwd1`, `../../../../etc/passwd2`, etc., depending on the page number. This could potentially overwrite critical memory areas, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `destFileName` contains the `%d` format specifier, and you should also validate the input to prevent directory traversal attacks. Additionally, consider using safer string formatting functions like `snprintf_s` or `vsnprintf` that include buffer size parameters to prevent buffer overflows.",1581,258,9.968646764755249

If the resulting string (including the page number) exceeds this size, it will cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) or even arbitrary code execution.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use a safer alternative like `snprintf`, which allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to be written to the buffer:

The provided C++ code for `soap_xmlParseMemory` is vulnerable due to the way it handles XML parsing, which can be exploited through an XML External Entity (XXE) attack. This vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-ID CVE-2013-1824, where an attacker can read arbitrary files on the server.

In the code, `xmlParseDocument` is called without any checks for external entities. If the XML content being parsed contains a reference to an external entity, the parser will attempt to resolve it. An attacker can craft a malicious XML file that includes an external entity pointing to a sensitive file on the server. When the parser tries to resolve this entity, it may read the content of the file, leading to information disclosure.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should ensure that the XML parser is configured to disallow the processing of external entities or to limit the entities to a safe subset. Additionally, keeping the XML parser library up to date with security patches is crucial to prevent known vulnerabilities from being exploited.",1422,239,9.264936923980713

The provided code for the `arbitraryTransformMask` function does not appear to be vulnerable based on the information given. The function is a part of the Poppler library and is used for image processing. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or other common security issues.

The function calculates the scaled width and height based on the input parameters and performs some coordinate manipulations. It then checks if the determinant is close to zero and returns early if it is. The function also includes a call to `scaleMask`, which is not shown in the provided code snippet.

The `majorityElement` function is unrelated to the `arbitraryTransformEE` function and is used to find the majority element in a vector of integers. It does not appear to be related to the vulnerability in question.

Please note that without the full context of the codebase and the `scaleMask` function, it is not possible to definitively say that there are no vulnerabilities. However, based on the provided code snippet, there are no clear vulnerabilities present.",3560,239,10.072520732879639

177907,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES

The provided code is vulnerable due to a potential integer overflow in the calculation of `d0` and `d1`. The expression `(255 << 23) / xp` and `(255 << 23) / (xp + 1)` can cause an integer overflow if `xp` is too large. This is because the left shift operation `255 << 23` results in a very large number, and dividing by `xp` or `xp + 1` may not be enough to prevent the overflow.

Additionally, the code does not check for division by zero, which could occur if `xp` is zero. This would lead to undefined behavior and could potentially cause a crash.

Moreover, the code does not handle the case where `srcWidth` is not a multiple of `srcHeight`, which could lead to incorrect memory accesses and potential buffer overflows.

Lastly, the code does not properly handle the case where `scaledWidth` is not a multiple of `srcWidth`, which could also lead to incorrect memory accesses and potential buffer overflows.

These issues could lead to a denial of service (DoS) or even arbitrary code execution, depending on the context in which the function is used and the environment in which it is executed.",1783,283,10.961419820785522

The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to a potential integer overflow in the calculation of the `d` variable. The line `d = (255 << 23) / yStep;` could cause an integer overflow if `yStep` is too small, leading to an incorrect value of `d`.

177911,Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided code is vulnerable to an integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the following lines:

```cpp
length = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
p      = table + 16;
count  = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
```

In this code, `TT_NEXT_ULONG` is a macro that reads an unsigned long integer from the memory location pointed by `p`. The `p` pointer is initially set to `table + 4`, and then it is incremented by 16.

The vulnerability arises when the input `table` is a specially crafted buffer that contains a large value in the first 4 bytes, followed by a large value in the next 4 bytes (at the position `table + 16`). In this case, the `length` variable will be set to a very large value, which may cause an integer overflow when it is used in the subsequent condition:

```cpp
if ( table + length > valid->limit || length < 20 + count * 2 )
```

If the `length` variable overflows, it may lead to an incorrect comparison and potentially allow an attacker to bypass the validation check. This could result in an integer overflow vulnerability, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

The provided code is vulnerable due to the potential for an out-of-bounds write, which can lead to a denial of service or remote code execution. The vulnerability is related to the handling of the `rlen` variable and the subsequent memory allocation and access.

In the `XListExtensions` function, the `rlen` variable is calculated as `rep.length << 2`. This operation assumes that `rep.length` is a valid unsigned integer value. However, if `rep.length` is a signed integer and it contains a negative value, the left shift operation could result in an incorrect `rlen` value that is too large, leading to an out-of-bounds write when allocating memory for `ch`.

Moreover, the code does not check if the allocated memory for `ch` is sufficient to hold the data read by `_XReadPad`. If the actual data size is larger than the allocated memory, it could also lead to an out-of-bounds write.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that `rep.length` is a valid unsigned integer and that the allocated memory for `ch` is sufficient to hold the data read by `_XReadPad`. Additionally, proper bounds checking should be performed when accessing the memory allocated for `ch`.",1838,277,10.804500579833984

The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to a potential buffer overflow in the `add_param_to_argv` function. The vulnerability arises from the use of a fixed-size buffer `param_buffer[1024]` to store parameters parsed from the input string. If the input string contains more than 1024 characters, the code will write beyond the bounds of the `param_buffer` array, leading to a buffer overflow. This can result in undefined behavior, including crashes or, in the worst case, arbitrary code execution if an attacker crafts the input carefully.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-ID CVE-2019-11360, where a buffer overflow in iptables-restore in netfilter iptables 1.8.2 allows an attacker to crash the program or potentially gain code execution via a specially crafted iptables-save file.

To fix this vulnerability, you should consider using safer alternatives to C-style strings and buffers, such as `std::string` and `std::vector<char>`, which can dynamically resize to accommodate the input data. Additionally, you should validate the input data to ensure it does not exceed the expected size before processing it.",2265,281,11.369632005691528
