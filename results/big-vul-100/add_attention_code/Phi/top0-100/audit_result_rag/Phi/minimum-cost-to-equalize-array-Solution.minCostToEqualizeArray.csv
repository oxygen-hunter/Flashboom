The provided code snippet does not appear to be vulnerable to the DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow_Mem._Corr. vulnerability described in the CVE-ID CVE-2013-6420. The vulnerability in the original code was related to improper parsing of timestamps in X.509 certificates, which could lead to memory corruption or arbitrary code execution.

In the modified code snippet, the function `asn1_time_to_time_t` is used to convert an ASN1_UTCTIME structure to a time_t value. The vulnerability in the original code was due to the incorrect handling of the year, month, and day components of the timestamp. The modified code correctly handles the year, month, and day components by using `atoi` and adjusting the year based on its value.

The modified code does not involve parsing X.509 certificates or handling their timestamps, so it is not vulnerable to the same issue.

The provided code is vulnerable due to a stack-based buffer overflow in the `sprintf` function call within the `extractPages` function. The `sprintf` function is used to format the `pathName` string with the `pageNo` variable, but the buffer size of `pathName` is fixed at 1024 bytes. If the resulting string exceeds this size, it will cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-ID CVE-2013-4473, where a stack-based buffer overflow in the `extractPages` function in the `poppler` library allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a source filename.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use a safer alternative to `sprintf`, such as `snprintf`, which allows you to specify the maximum number of bytes to write to the buffer, preventing buffer overflows. Here's an example of how you can modify the code to use `snprintf`:

The provided code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The vulnerability arises from the use of a fixed-size buffer `param_buffer[1024]` to store parameters read from the input. If the input contains a string longer than 1023 characters (plus the null terminator), it will overflow the buffer, potentially leading to undefined behavior, including crashes or even arbitrary code execution.

In the context of the vulnerability summary provided (CVE-2019-11360), the vulnerability is related to the `add_param_to_argv` function in `xshared.c`. The code you provided seems to be a similar function that could be used in a similar context, and it suffers from the same type of vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the buffer size is sufficient to hold the maximum expected input, or better yet, use a safer alternative like `std::string` or `std::vector<char>` which can dynamically resize to accommodate the input. Additionally, you should always validate the input length before copying it into the buffer.",2380,244,10.37579345703125

The provided C++ code for the `move_uploaded_file` function does not appear to be vulnerable to the Bypass.cpp vulnerability described in the CVE-2015-2348. The vulnerability in the original PHP code was due to the handling of filenames with null bytes, which could allow attackers to bypass file extension restrictions.

In the provided code, there is no evidence of filename handling or file extension checks that would be susceptible to the same vulnerability. The code focuses on moving a file from one path to another and does not involve filename manipulation or extension checks.

However, it is essential to note that without a complete understanding of the context in which this function is used and the overall application logic, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the code is entirely secure. It is always recommended to follow secure coding practices and perform thorough security testing to ensure the application's safety.",1978,205,8.688942670822144
