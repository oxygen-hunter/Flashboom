The code is a function that converts an ASN1_UTCTIME structure into a time_t value, which is a standard way to represent time in C/C++. The function does not execute any code or handle external input in a way that would lead to a denial of service or memory corruption.

The second part of the code, `sumGame`, is a function that takes a string representing a number with possible '?' characters and determines if Alice can win a game based on the rules described. This function is not related to the initial vulnerability and does not involve any memory operations that could lead to a buffer overflow or other memory-related vulnerabilities.

Therefore, based on the provided code snippets, there is no evidence of the specific vulnerability mentioned.",2060,204,8.824431657791138
177741,DoS Overflow," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `psession.size` and `session_data_size` variables. The code assumes that the size of the data that needs to be copied is correctly provided in `session_data_size`. If this size is underestimated, it can lead to a buffer overflow when `memcpy` is called, as it will attempt to copy more data than the allocated buffer can hold.

This is similar to the original vulnerability in the GnuTLS library, where a large `SessionTicket` could cause a buffer overflow. In this case, if the `session_data_size` is set to a value smaller than the actual size of the data in `psession.data`, it can lead to a buffer overflow and potentially a denial of service (DoS) attack.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `session_data_size` is always correctly set to the size of the data that needs to be copied, and that the buffer allocated for `session_data` is large enough to hold this data. Additionally, you should always check the return value of `memcpy` to ensure that the copy operation was successful.",1325,263,10.604461193084717
177742,DoS Overflow," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `psession.size` and `session_data_size` variables. The code checks if `psession.size` is greater than `*session_data_size`, and if so, it sets the return value to `GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER`. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent a buffer overflow.

The issue is that the `memcpy` function is called without checking if the `session_data` pointer is valid and if the destination buffer is large enough to hold the data being copied. If `session_data` is a null pointer or if the size of the buffer pointed to by `session_data` is smaller than `psession.size`, a buffer overflow can occur.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that `session_data` is a valid pointer and that the size of the destination buffer is at least as large as `psession.size` before calling `memcpy`. Additionally, the code should handle the case where `session_data_size` is zero, which would also lead to a buffer overflow.",1295,254,10.18723750114441

177792,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided C++ code is vulnerable to an integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the calculation of `rowSize` and the subsequent memory allocation using `gmalloc`. The `rowSize` is calculated based on the width and the mode, and then it is adjusted by adding `rowPad - 1` and subtracting the remainder of `rowSize % rowPad`. This could potentially lead to an integer overflow if the resulting `rowSize` is too large to be represented by an `int`.

For example, if `width` is a very large value and `rowPad` is also large, the calculation of `rowSize` could exceed the maximum value that an `int` can hold, causing an integer overflow. This overflow could result in a negative `rowSize`, which would then be used to allocate memory, potentially leading to a buffer overflow when `gmalloc` is called.

Additionally, the use of `gmalloc` is a concern because it is not a standard C++ memory allocation function. If `gmalloc` is not properly implemented to handle large allocations and potential integer overflows, it could lead to vulnerabilities such as denial of service (DoS) or even arbitrary code execution if the program crashes or behaves unexpectedly.

In summary, the vulnerability in the code is due to the potential for integer overflow in the calculation of `rowSize`, which could lead to incorrect",1536,301,12.072155952453613

177826,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the code is vulnerable due to a stack-based buffer overflow.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `sprintf` function in the following line:

```cpp
sprintf(pathName, destFileName, pageNo);
```

The `sprintf` function is used to format the `pathName` string by inserting the `pageNo` value into the `destFileName` string. However, the `destFileName` string may not have enough space to accommodate the additional characters from `pageNo`. If `pageNo` is a multi-digit number, it could cause the `sprintf` function to write beyond the bounds of the `pathName` buffer, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (crash) by crafting a malicious `srcFileName` or `destFileName` that triggers the buffer overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use a safer alternative to `sprintf`, such as `snprintf`, which allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to be written to the buffer, preventing buffer overflows. Here's an example of how to use `snprintf`:

```cpp
snprintf(pathName, sizeof(pathName), ""%s%d"", destFileName, pageNo);

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it handles XML parsing, which can lead to an XML External Entity (XXE) attack. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` function without proper validation or sanitization of the input filename. An attacker could exploit this by providing a maliciously crafted XML file that includes an external entity reference, potentially allowing them to read arbitrary files on the server where the code is running.

The vulnerability is related to the CVE-ID CVE-2013-1824 and CWE-ID CWE-200, as mentioned in the question. To mitigate this vulnerability, you should ensure that the input filename is properly validated and sanitized before using it in the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` function. Additionally, consider using a more secure XML parser that is not susceptible to XXE attacks or configure the existing parser to disable the processing of external entities.",1646,217,8.871875047683716

The provided C++ code for `soap_xmlParseFile` is not vulnerable to the XML External Entity (XXE) issue described in the vulnerability summary. The vulnerability in the original code was due to the use of `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` which could be exploited by an XML External Entity (XXE) attack. However, in the provided code, the function `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` is not used. Instead, the code directly assigns the filename to the `xmlDocPtr` variable `ret` without parsing it as an XML document.

The provided code for the `blitMask` function does not appear to be vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack based on the information given. The function is responsible for blitting a mask from a source bitmap to a destination, with optional antialiasing and clipping. The vulnerability mentioned in the CVE-ID CVE-2013-1789 is related to the `Splash::arbitraryTransformMask`, `Splash::blitMask`, and `Splash::scaleMaskYuXu` functions, but the provided code snippet only shows the `blitMask` function.

The `blitMask` function itself does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, uncontrolled format strings, or integer overflows that could lead to a DoS attack. The function iterates over the pixels of the source bitmap and applies the mask to the destination. The function also handles clipping and antialiasing based on the provided parameters.

However, without the full context of the `Splash` class and the `SplashBitmap` class, it is not possible to definitively say that there are no vulnerabilities in the code. The provided code snippet does not show any direct indication of a DoS vulnerability.",2032,282,11.86759638786316

The provided code is vulnerable due to a potential integer overflow issue. The vulnerability arises from the following lines:

```cpp
length = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
p      = table + 16;
count  = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
```

In this code, `TT_NEXT_ULONG` is a macro that reads an unsigned long integer from the byte array `table`. The vulnerability occurs when the input `table` contains large values that cause the `length` and `count` variables to overflow.

For example, if the input `table` contains a large value that causes `length` to overflow, the subsequent check:

```cpp
if ( table + length > valid->limit || length < 20 + count * 2 )
```

may not behave as expected, leading to incorrect validation results.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the values read by `TT_NEXT_ULONG` do not cause integer overflow. You can do this by adding checks to ensure that the values are within the expected range before performing arithmetic operations on them.",1301,255,10.237810373306274

The provided C++ code for the `move_uploaded_file` function does not appear to be vulnerable to the Bypass.cpp vulnerability described in the CVE-2015-2348. The code includes checks for the existence of the file in the `rfc1867_uploaded_files` hash and ensures that the new path is within the allowed open_basedir if set. Additionally, the code handles file permissions and ownership correctly.

However, it is important to note that the actual vulnerability lies in the PHP function `move_uploaded_file` itself, not in the C++ implementation. The vulnerability is due to the PHP function's handling of file paths containing null bytes, which can be exploited to bypass file extension restrictions. The C++ code provided here is just a wrapper for the PHP function and does not directly address the vulnerability in the PHP function.

To mitigate the vulnerability, you should ensure that you are using a patched version of PHP that includes the fix for CVE-2015-2348.",1917,242,9.991065740585327
