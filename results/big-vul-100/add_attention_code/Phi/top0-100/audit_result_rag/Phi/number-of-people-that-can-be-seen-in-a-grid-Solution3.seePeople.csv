177792,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the given C++ code is vulnerable to an integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the calculation of `rowSize` and the subsequent memory allocation using `gmalloc`. The `rowSize` is calculated based on the width and the mode, and then it is adjusted by adding `rowPad - 1` and subtracting the remainder of `rowSize % rowPad`. This could lead to an integer overflow if the resulting `rowSize` exceeds the maximum value that an integer can hold.

When `gmalloc` is called with `rowSize * height`, if `rowSize` is too large, it could cause an integer overflow, leading to a smaller-than-expected allocation size. This could result in a buffer overflow when the data is accessed, potentially causing a denial of service (application crash) or even arbitrary code execution if the memory is accessed in a way that allows for code execution.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that `rowSize` is always within the bounds of an integer and that the multiplication of `rowSize * height` does not cause an overflow.

The provided code is vulnerable due to the same reason as the original code snippet. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `len` variable, which is calculated as the difference between two pointers (`p - &(data[0])`). This calculation assumes that the length of the data being sent in the `rpc_req` function call is correct and does not exceed the allocated buffer size. However, if an attacker can control the input to the `rpc_req` function, they could potentially cause a buffer overflow by specifying a length that is larger than the allocated buffer size.

In the context of the provided code, the `len` variable is used to allocate memory for the `target` variable, which is then used to store the result of the `nfs_read_post_op_attr` function call.

The provided code snippet is vulnerable due to the use of `snprintf` with a format string that does not contain any format specifiers. This can lead to a format string vulnerability if the `destFileName` contains format specifiers that are not properly escaped or validated.

In the code, `snprintf` is used to create a filename for each page extracted from the PDF:

```cpp
snprintf(pathName, sizeof(pathName) - 1, destFileName, pageNo);
```

If `destFileName` contains format specifiers (like `%d`), and `pageNo` is not a valid integer, this could lead to a format string vulnerability. However, the code does check for the presence of `%d` in `destFileName` before using `snprintf`:

```cpp
if (firstPage!= lastPage && strstr(destFileName, ""%d"") == NULL) {
    error(errSyntaxError, -1, ""'{0:s}' must contain '%%d' if more than one page should be extracted"", destFileName);
    return false;
}
```

This check ensures that if `destFileName` does not contain `%d`, the function will not proceed with the extraction, which mitrightly prevents the format string vulnerability in this specific case.

However, the vulnerability mentioned in the question (C",1611,301,11.548820972442627
177826,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided code is vulnerable due to a stack-based buffer overflow.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `sprintf` function in the loop where it is used to format the `pathName` string. The `destFileName` string is expected to contain a format specifier `%d` to indicate where the page number should be inserted. However, if the `destFileName` does not contain the `%d` format specifier, the `sprintf` function will not know how to handle the page number, and it may lead to a buffer overflow if the page number is too large to fit in the allocated space for `pathName`.

This can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code, depending on the environment and how the program handles the crash.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use a safer alternative to `sprintf`, such as `snprintf`, which allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to be written to the buffer, preventing buffer overflows. Here's an example of how you can modify the code to use `snprintf`:

```cpp
for (int pageNo = firstPage; pageNo <= lastPage; pageNo++) {
    int written = snprintf(pathName, sizeof(pathName), destFileName, pageNo);

The vulnerability lies in the use of the `kstrdup` function without proper bounds checking. The `kstrdup` function is used to duplicate a string, but if the source string is not null-terminated or if the size of the source string is not known, it can lead to a buffer overflow. In the given code, `kstrdup` is used to duplicate the `edid_firmware` string, which is a list of firmware files separated by commas.

If the `edid_firmware` string is not properly null-terminated or if it contains more than `GFP_KERNEL` bytes, the `kstrdup` function will attempt to read beyond the allocated memory, leading to a buffer overflow. This can cause a NULL pointer dereference and potentially crash the system, which is a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `edid_firmware` string is properly null-terminated and that the size of the string does not exceed the allocated memory.

The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the DoS_Overflow issue described in the initial prompt. The vulnerability in the original code was due to an integer overflow when calculating the size of the memory block to allocate. In the revised code, the calculation of `added` is the same, but there is no subsequent use of this value in a way that could cause an overflow. The allocation is done using `malloc(added)`, which is a standard C function that handles memory allocation and would not directly cause an overflow in the same way as the original code.

However, it is important to note that without a complete context or the ability to test the code in a controlled environment, it is not possible to guarantee that there are no other vulnerabilities present. The code provided does not contain the exact same logic as the original code that was identified as vulnerable, so based on the information given, it does not exhibit the same DoS_Overflow vulnerability.",2281,204,8.400964975357056

The vulnerability in the code is due to the potential for a NULL pointer dereference. The function `d2i_RSA_PSS_PARAMS` and `d2i_X509_ALGOR` are used to convert binary data into their respective structures. If the input data is not properly formatted or if the ASN.1 sequence is missing, these functions may return NULL. However, the code does not check if the returned pointers are NULL before using them.

In the line `*pmaskHash = d2i_X509_ALGOR(NULL, &p, plen);`, if `d2i_X509_ALGOR` returns NULL, then dereferencing `*pmaskHash` will cause a NULL pointer dereference, which can lead to a crash or undefined behavior.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add checks to ensure that the pointers returned by `d2i_RSA_PSS_PARAMS` and `d2i_X509_ALGOR` are not NULL before using them. Here's an updated version of the code with the necessary checks:

The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to the same reason as the original vulnerable code snippet. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` function with a filename that could potentially contain a malicious XML External Entity (XXE) reference. This can lead to an XXE attack, where an attacker can read arbitrary files on the server by crafting a special XML document that includes a reference to a system file.

In the provided code, the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` function is called with the `filename` parameter, which could be controlled by an attacker. If the filename contains an XML External Entity declaration, it could lead to the aforementioned XXE vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `filename` parameter is properly sanitized and validated before being passed to the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` function. Additionally, you should update the PHP version to a patched version (5.3.22 or later for 5.x, or 5.4.12 or later for 5.4.x) that includes fixes for this vulnerability.",1622,252,9.76114797592163

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the XML parser is configured to properly handle external entities and references. In the case of the libxml2 library, you can set the `XML_PARSE_NOENT` option to prevent the parser from processing external entities.

The vulnerability lies in the following lines:

```cpp
length = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
p      = table + 16;
count  = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
```

In this code, `TT_NEXT_ULONG(p)` is used to read an unsigned long integer from the `table` array. If the value of `length` or `count` is too large, it can cause an integer overflow when used in the subsequent calculations:

```cpp
if ( table + length > valid->limit || length < 20 + count * 2 )
```

If `length` or `count` overflows, the resulting value may be smaller than the actual value, causing the condition to be evaluated incorrectly. This can lead to a buffer overflow when accessing the `table` array, as the code may read or write beyond the allocated memory.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add checks to ensure that `length` and `count` do not overflow when used in calculations.

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it handles the `rlen` variable. The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-ID CVE-2018-14600. In the code, `rlen` is calculated as `rep.length << 2`, which assumes that `rep.length` is a valid unsigned integer. However, if `rep.length` is a large value that exceeds the maximum value of an unsigned integer, the left shift operation could cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect `rlen` value.

This incorrect `rlen` value could result in an out-of-bounds write when reading from the `ch` buffer, as the code assumes that `ch` has enough space to store the data read from the display. If `rlen` is too large, it could cause the code to write past the end of the `ch` buffer, leading to a potential DoS or remote code execution vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that `rlen` is calculated correctly and does not cause an integer overflow. Additionally, the code should validate the size of the `ch` buffer before reading data into it to prevent out-of-bounds writes.",1868,271,10.666121482849121

The provided code is vulnerable due to a potential buffer overflow. The vulnerability arises from the way the code reads data into the buffer `ch` without properly checking the length of the data received against the size of the buffer.

In the function `XGetFontPath`, the code allocates memory for `ch` based on the value of `rep.length` after shifting it left by 2 bits (effectively multiplying by 4). This assumes that the data received will be at most `rep.length` characters long. However, the actual data read by `_XReadPad` could be longer than `rep.length`, leading to a buffer overflow if the data exceeds the allocated size of `ch`.

The buffer overflow can occur because the code does not check if the actual length of the data read is less than or equal to the allocated size of `ch`. If the data is longer, it will overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to a crash or allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the size of the data read does not exceed the allocated size of the buffer `ch`. This can be done by checking the actual length of the data read and comparing it to the allocated size before copying the data into the buffer.",1811,275,10.71974778175354
