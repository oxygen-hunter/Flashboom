177742,DoS Overflow," YES

The provided code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The vulnerability arises from the line:

```cpp
if (psession.size > *session_data_size)
```

This line checks if the size of the data in the `psession` datum is greater than the size of the buffer pointed to by `session_data`. If the size of `psession.data` is indeed larger than the size of the buffer, the function returns an error code, but it does not prevent the subsequent `memcpy` operation from copying more data than the buffer can hold. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can cause a denial of service (application crash) or potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the `memcpy` operation does not copy more data than the size of the buffer. This can be done by modifying the `memcpy` line to:

```cpp
if (session_data!= NULL)
    memcpy (session_data, psession.data, *session_data_size);
```

This change ensures that only the size of the buffer is used for copying data, preventing a buffer overflow.","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

The provided code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the potential for an off-by-one error in the `movesToStamp` function. This error can cause the function to enter an infinite loop when processing certain inputs, leading to a DoS condition.

The vulnerability arises from the following line in the `movesToStamp` function:

```cpp
for (int j = max(0, i - M + 1); j < min(N - M, i) + 1; ++j) {
```

In this line, the loop condition is `j < min(N - M, i) + 1`. However, when `i` is equal to `N - M`, the condition becomes `j < 0`, which is an off-by-one error. This error can cause the loop to iterate indefinitely, leading to a DoS condition.

To fix this vulnerability, the loop condition should be updated to `j <= min(N - M, i) + right_left_pad(str_key, dirlen);

The provided code for the `SplashFTFont::makeGlyph` function does not appear to be vulnerable to the DoS_Exec_Overflow vulnerability described in the CVE-2009-3605 issue. The function is responsible for creating a glyph from a font file, setting transformations, loading the glyph, rendering it, and then copying the bitmap data into a buffer.

The vulnerability in the original code (CVE-2009-3605) was related to integer overflows in the handling of font files and the processing of PDF files, which could lead to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution. However, the provided `SplashFTFont::makeGlyph` function does not involve handling of external files or processing of user-supplied data in a way that could lead to similar vulnerabilities.

The `movesToStamp` function provided is a separate piece of code that calculates moves to stamp a pattern onto a target string. It does not interact with font files or glyph rendering and thus is not related to the vulnerability in question.

Therefore, based on the provided code snippet, there is no indication of a DoS_Exec_Overflow vulnerability in the `SplashFTFont::makeGlyph` function.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The provided C++ code for `BufCompressedFill` does not appear to be vulnerable to the specified Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The vulnerability in question is related to the handling of code words that are absent from the decompression table, which can lead to an infinite loop or a heap-based buffer overflow. The given code does not directly deal with decompression tables or code words in the same manner as the vulnerable code.

The `BufCompressedFill` function is a compression decompression routine that reads compressed data from a buffer and decompresses it into another buffer. It does not handle code words or decompression tables in a way that would lead to the vulnerability described. The function reads compressed data, decompresses it, and writes the decompressed data to a buffer. It does not execute any code or handle code words that could be missing from a decompression table.

This function is unrelated to the `BufCompressedFill` function and does not involve any decompression or code handling that could lead to the vulnerability.

The provided code is vulnerable due to a stack-based buffer overflow in the `sprintf` function call within the `extractPages` function. The `sprintf` function is used to format the `pathName` string with the `pageNo` variable, but the destination buffer `pathName` is only allocated with a fixed size of 1024 bytes. If the combined length of `destFileName` and the formatted `pageNo` exceeds 1023 characters (accounting for the null terminator), it will result in a buffer overflow, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) or arbitrary code execution.

This vulnerability is similar to the CVE-2013-4473 issue in the original code snippet provided.

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it handles the '*' and '?' characters in the pattern matching function. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the incorrect handling of '\0' characters when '?' is encountered in the pattern. This can lead to buffer over-reads, which may cause information disclosure or a denial of service.

In the original vulnerable code, when a '?' character is encountered, the function decrements the `stringdashes` counter if the next character in the string is `XK_minus`. However, it does not properly handle the case where the next character is a '\0' (null terminator), which should indicate the end of the string. This can lead to the function reading beyond the end of the string, causing a buffer over-read.

In the provided code snippet, the handling of '\0' characters is not shown, and it is not clear if the vulnerability has been fixed. If the same logic is applied, the vulnerability still exists. To fix this issue, the code should properly check for the null terminator and handle it accordingly to prevent buffer over-reads.","The code contains a DoS vulnerability.

The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to the way it handles XML parsing. The vulnerability is related to XML External Entities (XXE), which can be exploited to read arbitrary files on the server. The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-ID CVE-2013-1824, where the SOAP parser in PHP before version 5.3.22 and 5.4.x before 5.4.12 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a SOAP WSDL file containing an XML external entity declaration.

In the provided code, the `xmlParseDocument` function is called without proper validation of the XML content. An attacker can craft a malicious XML file with an external entity declaration that references a file on the server. When the parser processes this XML, it will attempt to access the referenced file, leading to a potential information disclosure vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, you should update the PHP version to at least 5.3.22 or 5.4.12, depending on the version you are using.

The provided C++ code for `soap_xmlParseMemory` is vulnerable due to the way it handles XML parsing. The vulnerability is related to XML External Entities (XXE), which can be exploited to read arbitrary files on the server.

In the provided code, the `xmlParseDocument` function is called without setting the `XML_PARSE_DTDLOAD` option, which means that the parser will process DTDs (Document Type Definitions) and potentially resolve external entities.

The function `TT_NEXT_ULONG` is used to read an unsigned long integer from the `table` array. If the `table` array contains a value that, when interpreted as an unsigned long integer, exceeds the maximum value that an unsigned long integer can hold (which is `ULONG_MAX`), an integer overflow will occur. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including the possibility of executing arbitrary code.

In the context of the vulnerability summary provided, this code is part of the `tt_cmap10_validate` function, which is related to the CVE-ID CVE-2009-0946 and CWE-ID CWE-189. The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to large values in certain inputs.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the values read by `TT_NEXT_ULONG` do not exceed the maximum value of an unsigned long integer. Additionally, you should consider using safer functions or techniques to handle large values and prevent integer overflows.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The provided C++ code for `add_param_to_argv` is not vulnerable to the Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability described in the context. The vulnerability in the original code snippet was due to the use of a fixed-size buffer (`char param_buffer[1024]`) and the lack of proper bounds checking when copying characters into this buffer. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the input string exceeds the buffer size.

In the provided C++ code, there is no direct evidence of a buffer overflow vulnerability. The code uses a `vector<int>` to store the results, which dynamically allocates memory as needed, and there is no fixed-size buffer that could be overflowed by the input. However, without the full context of how `xtables_error` and `add_argv` are implemented, it's not possible to definitively say there are no vulnerabilities in the code. But based on the information given, the specific vulnerability mentioned (CVE-2019-11360) does not appear to be present in the provided code snippet.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
