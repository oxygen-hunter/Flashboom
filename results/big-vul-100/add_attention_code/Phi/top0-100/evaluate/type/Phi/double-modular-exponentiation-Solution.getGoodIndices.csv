The provided code snippet is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability (CVE-2015-8467, CWE-264). The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during the creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC.

In the context of the provided code, the vulnerability is related to the `samldb_check_user_account_control_acl` function, which is responsible for checking user account control attributes. The function contains a mapping of user account control (UAC) flags to their corresponding OIDs and error strings. However, the vulnerability is not directly related to the mapping itself but rather to the lack of proper privilege checks when creating machine accounts.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should include proper privilege checks to ensure that only users with the necessary administrative privileges can create machine accounts. This can be achieved by adding a privilege check before the creation of machine accounts and ensuring that the user has the required privileges to perform the operation.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

177740,DoS Exec Code Overflow Mem. Corr.," YES

The provided C++ code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `strbuf` pointer, which is allocated using `estrdup` without checking the size of the input string `timestr->data`. If the input string is larger than the allocated buffer, this could lead to a buffer overflow when copying the string data.

In the original vulnerable code, the buffer overflow is mitigated by checking the length of the input string and returning an error if it is less than 13 characters. However, the provided code does not include this check, making it vulnerable to a buffer overflow if the input string is too long.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add a check to ensure that the input string is not longer than the allocated buffer size before copying the string data.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow_Mem._Corr. vulnerability.

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, similar to the original vulnerable code. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the size of the buffer `session_data` is determined by the value of `psession.size`, which is obtained from the session data. If a malicious TLS server sends a large `SessionTicket` with a size that exceeds the allocated buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow when copying the session data to `session_data`.

This vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (application crash) as the buffer overflow can corrupt the memory and cause the program to crash. The CVE-ID CVE-2011-4128 and CWE-ID CWE-119 mentioned in the question are associated with this type of vulnerability in the GnuTLS library.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the size of the buffer `session_data` is large enough to accommodate the session data, or implement additional checks to prevent buffer overflows.","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack, similar to the vulnerability described in the original code. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly validate the size of the `session_data` buffer before copying data into it. If an attacker can control the `session_data_size` pointer to point to a smaller buffer than the actual size of the data in `psession.data`, they can cause a buffer overflow when `memcpy` is called. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the application.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that `session_data_size` accurately reflects the size of the buffer pointed to by `session_data`. This can be done by passing the size of the buffer as an argument to the function or by using a safer function like `memcpy_s` (if available) that requires the size of the destination buffer as an argument.","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

The provided code snippet does not appear to be vulnerable to the DoS_Exec_Code vulnerability described in the CVE-ID CVE-2018-1000039. The code is a function for handling soft masks in a PDF processing context, and it does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to heap use after free, buffer overflows, or other common vulnerabilities that could lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.

The function `begin_softmask` is responsible for setting up a soft mask for PDF rendering. It checks if the `softmask` is NULL and handles it accordingly. It also sets up a transformation matrix and a colorspace for the soft mask. The function uses a try-catch-like mechanism with `fz_try`, `fz_always`, and `fz_catch` to handle potential errors during the masking process.

The `getGoodIndices` function is a separate piece of code that is not related to the PDF processing context and is used to find indices of vectors that meet a certain mathematical condition. It does not interact with any external resources or perform any operations that could lead to a vulnerability in the context of the provided PDF processing code.

The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to the potential for a stack overflow caused by recursive calls in the `dns_read_name` function. The vulnerability arises when the function encounters a compressed DNS name pointer that points to itself or creates a long chain of valid pointers, leading to infinite recursion or a very deep recursion that exceeds the stack size limit.

In the code, the recursive call to `dns_read_name` is made when a compressed pointer is encountered:

```cpp
n = dns_read_name(buffer, bufend, buffer + reader[1],
                 dest, dest_len - nb_bytes, offset);
```

If the pointer `buffer + reader[1]` points to a location within the `buffer` itself, or if it creates a long chain of valid pointers, the function will keep calling itself indefinitely or until the stack size limit is reached, causing a stack overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the compressed pointer does not point to itself or create a long chain of valid pointers. You can also implement a depth limit for the recursion to prevent excessive stack usage.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

177792,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the given C++ code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the calculation of `rowSize` and the subsequent memory allocation using `gmalloc`. The potential for integer overflow exists when calculating `rowSize` based on the width and the mode. If `width` is large enough, the multiplication by 3, 4, or 4 (in the case of `splashModeCMYK8`) could cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect `rowSize`. This incorrect `rowSize` is then used to allocate memory, which could result in a buffer overflow if the allocated memory is smaller than expected.

Additionally, the code uses `gmalloc`, which is not a standard C++ memory allocation function. If `gmalloc` is similar to `malloc` and does not perform any additional checks, it could lead to vulnerabilities if the size passed to it is incorrect due to integer overflow.

Moreover, the code does not check for integer overflow when adding `rowPad - 1` to `rowSize` or when performing the modulo operation to align `rowSize` with `rowPad`. If `rowPad` is large enough, these operations could also lead to integer overflow.

Lastly, the code does not handle the case where `height` is zero, which would lead to a division by zero error when calculating the memory allocation size.

In summary, the code is vulnerable to","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177796,Overflow," YES

The provided code snippet is vulnerable due to the same reason as the original code you mentioned. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `len` variable, which is calculated as the difference between two pointers (`p - &(data[0])`). This calculation assumes that the length of the data being passed to the `rpc_req` function is correct and does not exceed the bounds of the `data` array.

However, if an attacker can control the input to the `nfs_readlink_req` function, they could potentially manipulate the length of the data being passed, leading to a buffer overflow. This could result in the overwriting of adjacent memory, potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the length of the data being passed to the `rpc_req` function is properly validated and does not exceed the bounds of the `data` array. Additionally, you should consider using safer functions that handle buffer sizes more securely, such as `memcpy_s` or `snprintf`, to prevent buffer overflows.","The code contains a Overflow vulnerability.

The provided code is vulnerable due to a stack-based buffer overflow in the `sprintf` function call within the `extractPages` function. The `sprintf` function is used to format the `pathName` string, which is a local stack variable with a fixed size of 1024 bytes. If the `destFileName` combined with the page number (`pageNo`) exceeds this size, it will cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) or arbitrary code execution (Exec).

The provided C++ code for `reds_handle_ticket` is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, similar to the vulnerability described in the original code snippet. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `strncmp` function with the `SPICE_MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH` as the length parameter. If an attacker provides a password that is exactly `SPICE_MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH` characters long, the `strncmp` function will not null-terminate the password string, potentially leading to a buffer overflow when the password is compared.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the password string is always null-terminated, even when it is exactly `SPICE_MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH` characters long. You can do this by explicitly adding a null character at the end of the password string before using it in the `strncmp` function.

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it handles the '\0' character in the pattern matching function. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code incorrectly skips '\0' characters when processing '?' characters in the pattern. This can lead to buffer over-reads, which may cause information disclosure or a denial of service (DoS) attack.

In the original vulnerable code, the '\0' character is decremented in the `patdashes` and `stringdashes` variables, which can lead to a buffer over-read when the pattern contains a '?' character followed by a '\0' character. The vulnerability is fixed in the provided code by removing the decrement operations for `patdashes` and `rightdashes` when a '\0' character is encountered.

However, the provided code still contains a logical error in the `getGoodIndices` function. The function is not related to the pattern matching vulnerability, but it contains a potential integer overflow issue in the `addmod` function. The `addmod` function uses unsigned integer overflow to calculate the result, which can lead to incorrect results if the input values are large enough.

To fix the vulnerability in the pattern matching function, you should ensure that the decrement operations for `patdashes` and `stringdashes` are not performed when a '\0' character is encountered. Additionally","The code contains a DoS vulnerability.

The provided C++ code does not appear to be vulnerable to the specific integer overflow issue described in the question. The code uses custom functions `addmod`, `mulmod`, and `powmod` to handle arithmetic operations with modulo, which helps prevent integer overflow by ensuring that the results of these operations remain within the bounds of the data type `uint32_t`.

However, it is essential to note that the code's security and correctness depend on the context in which it is used and the input it receives.

The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to the same reason as the original code snippet you provided. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` function with a filename that could potentially contain an XML External Entity (XXE) reference. This can lead to an XXE attack, where an attacker can cause the parser to disclose local files or other sensitive information.

In the code, the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` function is called with the `filename` parameter, which is a user-supplied input. If an attacker provides a filename that contains an XML External Entity declaration, the parser will attempt to access and load the external entity, potentially leading to unautocessful disclosure of sensitive information.

The vulnerability lies in the following lines:

```cpp
length = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
p      = table + 16;
count  = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
```

In this code, `TT_NEXT_ULONG` is used to read a 4-byte unsigned long from the `table` pointer. The `table` pointer is incremented by 4 initially, and then by 16. This means that the code is reading values from the `table` pointer that are 4 and 16 bytes away, respectively.

If the input `table` is not properly sanitized and contains values that are not valid unsigned long integers, this can lead to an integer overflow. An integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is outside the range of the data type. In this case, if the value read from the `table` pointer is too large to fit in an unsigned long integer, it will cause an integer overflow.

An integer overflow can lead to unexpected behavior, such as incorrect values being used in subsequent calculations or even memory corruption.

The provided C++ code snippet is vulnerable to an integer overflow. The vulnerability arises from the way the code calculates the `length` and `num_groups` variables, as well as the arithmetic operations within the loop that checks the groups.

In the code, `length` is calculated by reading a 32-bit unsigned integer from the `table` pointer at an offset of 4 bytes. Similarly, `num_groups` is calculated by reading a 32-bit unsigned integer from the `table` pointer at an offset of 12 bytes. If the input `table` contains values that cause the `length` or `num_groups` to exceed the maximum value of a 32-bit unsigned integer (4,294,967,295), an integer overflow will occur.

Additionally, the loop that checks the groups performs arithmetic operations on the `start`, `end`, and `start_id` variables. If these variables contain values that cause an integer overflow, the code may produce incorrect results or even crash.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add checks to ensure that the values of `length`, `num_groups`, `start`, `end`, and `start_id` do not exceed the maximum value of a 32-bit unsigned integer.

The provided C++ code for `XGetFontPath` is vulnerable due to a potential buffer overflow. The vulnerability arises from the way the code calculates the size of the buffer `ch` based on the value of `rep.length`. If `rep.length` is larger than `INT_MAX / 2`, the calculation of `nbytes` will overflow, leading to a smaller buffer size than required. When `_XReadPad` is called with `nbytes`, it may not allocate enough space to read all the data, potentially causing a buffer overflow when the data is copied into `ch`.

This vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-ID CVE-2018-14599, where an off-by-one error in the `XListExtensions` function in `ListExt.c` of the libX11 library could lead to a DoS or other unspecified impacts. In this case, the vulnerability is due to an integer overflow that could lead to a buffer overflow.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to a potential integer overflow issue when calculating the powers of large numbers. The `powmod` function is used to calculate the power of a number modulo another number, which is a common operation in cryptographic algorithms. However, the code does not handle the case where the result of the power operation exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a `uint32_t` type.

In the `powmod` function, the line `a = mulmod(a, a, mod);` is responsible for squaring the number `a` and taking the modulo. If `a` is large enough, the result of `a * a` could overflow the `uint32_t` type before the modulo operation is applied. This could lead to incorrect results and potentially cause the function to return an incorrect index or no index at all.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `mulmod` function handles overflow correctly by using a larger data type or implementing a safe multiplication algorithm that can handle large numbers without overflow. Additionally, you should consider using a library or built-in functions that are designed to handle large numbers and modular arithmetic securely.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to a potential buffer overflow in the `add_param_to_argv` function. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the size of the `param_buffer` array is fixed at 1024 bytes. If the input string `parsestart` is longer than 1023 characters (excluding the null terminator), it will cause a buffer overflow when copying characters into `param_buffer`.

In the code, the `param_len` variable is used to keep track of the number of characters copied into `param_buffer`. However, there is no check to ensure that `param_len` does not exceed the size of `param_buffer` before copying more characters. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can cause a crash or potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add a check to ensure that `param_len` does not exceed the size of `param_buffer` before copying more characters. For example:

```cpp
if (param_len < sizeof(param_buffer) - 1) {
    param_buffer[param_len++] = *curchar;
}
```

Additionally, you should also ensure that the `param_buffer` is null-terminated after copying all characters, to avoid any issues with string","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177923,Bypass," YES

The provided C++ code for the `move_uploaded_file` function is vulnerable due to the same Bypass.cpp vulnerability as mentioned in the original code snippet. The vulnerability arises from the handling of file paths that may contain null bytes (`\x00`).

In the code, the `zend_parse_parameters` function is used to parse the arguments passed to the `move_uploaded_file` function. The second argument, `new_path`, is expected to be a string representing the new file path. However, if an attacker provides a file path containing a null byte, the `zend_parse_parameters` function will truncate the path at the null byte, effectively ignoring the rest of the path.

This allows an attacker to bypass intended extension restrictions and create files with unexpected names by crafting a second argument that includes a null byte followed by a different file extension. For example, an attacker could provide a path like `""./uploads/malicious_file.php\x00.txt""` which would be truncated to `""./uploads/malicious_file.php""` by the `zend_parse_parameters` function, allowing the attacker to create a file with the `.txt` extension in the intended directory.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should be updated to properly handle file paths containing null","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.
