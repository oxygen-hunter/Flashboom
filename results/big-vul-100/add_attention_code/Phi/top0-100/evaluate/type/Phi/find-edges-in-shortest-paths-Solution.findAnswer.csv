177741,DoS Overflow," YES

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly check the size of the `session_data` buffer before copying data into it. If the `psession.size` is larger than the size pointed to by `session_data`, the `memcpy` function will write past the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. This can result in a denial of service (DoS) as it may corrupt the memory and cause the application to crash.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the original code snippet, where the `gnutls_session_get_data` function does not ensure that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the data being copied into it. This can be exploited by an attacker by crafting a session with a large `SessionTicket` that, when processed by the vulnerable function, leads to a buffer overflow and potentially a crash of the application.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should include a check to ensure that `session_data_size` is at least as large as `psession.size` before performing the `memcpy` operation. If the buffer is not large enough, the function should handle the error appropriptaely, such as by returning an error code or allocating a larger buffer if possible.","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

The provided code snippet for `gnutls_session_get_data` is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, similar to the vulnerability described in the original code. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check the size of the `session_data` buffer before copying data into it. If the size of the data in `psession.data` exceeds the size of the buffer pointed to by `session_data`, a buffer overflow can occur, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) or other security issues.

In the code, the check `if (psession.size > *session_data_size)` is performed before the `memcpy` operation. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent a buffer overflow because it only checks the size of the data in `psession.data`, not the size of the buffer itself. If the `session_data_size` is smaller than the actual size of the buffer, the check will pass, but the `memcpy` operation will still overflow the buffer.

To fix this vulnerability, the function should ensure that the size of the buffer pointed to by `session_data` is at least as large as the size of the data in `psession.data`. This can be done by passing the size of the buffer as an argument to the function and using it in the `memcpy` operation, like this","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

This can potentially overwrite executable code or function pointers, leading to arbitrary code execution.

In the provided code, there are no instances of unsafe buffer manipulations or operations that could lead to a buffer overflow. The code uses standard C++ containers like `vector` and `priority_queue`, which handle memory management and prevent buffer overflows.

The provided C++ code for the `SplashBitmap` constructor is vulnerable to integer overflow, which can lead to a DoS (Denial of Service) or potentially arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability arises from the calculation of `rowSize` and the subsequent memory allocation using `gmalloc`.

In the code, `rowSize` is calculated based on the `mode` and the `width` of the bitmap. The calculation involves operations like addition, multiplication, and bitwise shifting, which can cause integer overflow if the values of `width` and `rowSize` are large enough.

For example, consider the case where `mode` is `splashModeMono1`. The calculation of `rowSize` is as follows:

```cpp
rowSize = (width + 7) >> 3;
```

If `width` is a large value, the addition of 7 can cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect `rowSize` value.

Similarly, in the case where `mode` is `splashModeRGB8`, `splashModeBGR8`, `splashModeXBGR8`, or `splashModeCMYK8`, the calculation of `rowSize` involves multiplication:

```cpp
rowSize = width * 3; // for RGB8, BGR8

The provided code is vulnerable due to a stack-based buffer overflow in the `sprintf` function call within the `extractPages` function. The `sprintf` function is used to format the `pathName` string with the `pageNo` variable, but the destination buffer `pathName` is only 1024 bytes in size. If the `pageNo` variable is large enough, it could cause the `sprintf` function to write more data than the buffer can hold, leading to a buffer overflow. This can result in a denial of service (crash) and potentially allow arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the input.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the provided CVE-ID CVE-2013-4473, where a stack-based buffer overflow in the `extractPages` function in the `poppler` library allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a source filename.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The provided C++ code is a function that determines if there is a minimum cut in a graph that separates the graph into two disconnected subgraphs. The function uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in the graph.

The provided C++ code does not appear to be vulnerable to the DoS_Overflow issue described in the original code snippet. The vulnerability in the original code was due to an integer overflow when calculating the size of the memory block to allocate.

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it handles XML parsing. The vulnerability is related to XML External Entities (XXE), which can be exploited to read arbitrary files on the server. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not disable the processing of external entities within the XML documents it parses.

In the code snippet, the `xmlParseDocument` function is called without any checks for external entities. If an XML document with an external entity reference is parsed, it could lead to the disclosure of sensitive files on the server.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should ensure that the XML parser is configured to disable the processing of external entities. This can be done by setting the `XML_PARSE_NOENT` option in the `xmlSetParserOptions` function before parsing the document.

Here's an example of how to modify the code to disable external entities:

```cpp
xmlSetParserOptions(ctxt, XML_PARSE_NOENT);
xmlParseDocument(ctxt);
```

By adding this line before parsing the document, you can prevent the XXE vulnerability in the code.","The code contains a +Info vulnerability.

The provided C++ code for the function `_asn1_ltostr` is vulnerable to an integer overflow. The vulnerability arises from the line `temp[start + count] = '0' + (char) r;` where `r` is calculated as `v - d * 10`. If `v` is a very large number, `d * 10` could cause an integer overflow when subtracted from `v`, leading to an incorrect value of `r`. This incorrect value could then be used to access an out-of-bounds index in the `temp` array, potentially leading to a buffer overflow when the string is constructed.


Additionally, the code does not check if the `str` buffer provided is large enough to hold the resulting string, including the null terminator. If the `str` buffer is smaller than the size of the string that `v` represents, this could also lead to a buffer overflow when copying the string from `temp` to `str`.

The vulnerability lies in the following lines:

```cpp
length = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
p      = table + 16;
count  = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
```

In this code, `TT_NEXT_ULONG` is a macro that reads an unsigned long integer from the byte array `table`. The vulnerability arises when the input `table` contains values that cause an integer overflow during the calculation of `length` and `count`.

For example, if the input `table` contains a large value that causes `length` to overflow, the subsequent calculation of `table + length` will also overflow, leading to an incorrect memory access. This can result in a buffer overflow, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the values read by `TT_NEXT_ULONG` do not cause an integer overflow. You can add checks to ensure that the values are within the expected range before performing the calculations. Additionally, you can use a safer data type, such as `std::uint64_t`, to handle larger values and prevent overflow.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The provided C++ code implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from node 0 to all other nodes and from node n-1 to all other nodes in a graph. It then checks if there is a path from node 0 to node n-1 that passes through any of the given edges. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the openssl_seal() function or any other part of the code.","The code contains a nan vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2017-11144. The CWE-ID is CWE-754.
Vulnerability summary:
In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, the openssl extension PEM sealing code did not check the return value of the OpenSSL sealing function, which could lead to a crash of the PHP interpreter, related to an interpretation conflict for a negative number in ext/openssl/openssl.c, and an OpenSSL documentation omission.
