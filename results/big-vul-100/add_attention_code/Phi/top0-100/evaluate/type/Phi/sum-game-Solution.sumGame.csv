177740,DoS Exec Code Overflow Mem. Corr.," NO

The provided C++ code does not appear to be vulnerable to the DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow_Mem._Corr. vulnerability described in the initial message. The code is a function that converts an ASN1_UTCTIME structure into a time_t value, which is a standard way to represent time in C/C++. The function does not execute any code or handle external input in a way that would lead to a denial of service or memory corruption.

The second part of the code, `sumGame`, is a function that takes a string representing a number with possible '?' characters and determines if Alice can win a game based on the rules described. This function is not related to the initial vulnerability and does not involve any memory operations that could lead to a buffer overflow or other memory-related vulnerabilities.

Therefore, based on the provided code snippets, there is no evidence of the specific vulnerability mentioned.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow_Mem._Corr. vulnerability.

177741,DoS Overflow," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `psession.size` and `session_data_size` variables. The code assumes that the size of the data that needs to be copied is correctly provided in `session_data_size`. If this size is underestimated, it can lead to a buffer overflow when `memcpy` is called, as it will attempt to copy more data than the allocated buffer can hold.

This is similar to the original vulnerability in the GnuTLS library, where a large `SessionTicket` could cause a buffer overflow. In this case, if the `session_data_size` is set to a value smaller than the actual size of the data in `psession.data`, it can lead to a buffer overflow and potentially a denial of service (DoS) attack.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `session_data_size` is always correctly set to the size of the data that needs to be copied, and that the buffer allocated for `session_data` is large enough to hold this data. Additionally, you should always check the return value of `memcpy` to ensure that the copy operation was successful.","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

",3.0,871.0,6.0,3.4676496982574463
177742,DoS Overflow," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `psession.size` and `session_data_size` variables. The code checks if `psession.size` is greater than `*session_data_size`, and if so, it sets the return value to `GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER`. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent a buffer overflow.

The issue is that the `memcpy` function is called without checking if the `session_data` pointer is valid and if the destination buffer is large enough to hold the data being copied. If `session_data` is a null pointer or if the size of the buffer pointed to by `session_data` is smaller than `psession.size`, a buffer overflow can occur.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that `session_data` is a valid pointer and that the size of the destination buffer is at least as large as `psession.size` before calling `memcpy`. Additionally, the code should handle the case where `session_data_size` is zero, which would also lead to a buffer overflow.","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

177792,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided C++ code is vulnerable to an integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the calculation of `rowSize` and the subsequent memory allocation using `gmalloc`. The `rowSize` is calculated based on the width and the mode, and then it is adjusted by adding `rowPad - 1` and subtracting the remainder of `rowSize % rowPad`. This could potentially lead to an integer overflow if the resulting `rowSize` is too large to be represented by an `int`.

For example, if `width` is a very large value and `rowPad` is also large, the calculation of `rowSize` could exceed the maximum value that an `int` can hold, causing an integer overflow. This overflow could result in a negative `rowSize`, which would then be used to allocate memory, potentially leading to a buffer overflow when `gmalloc` is called.

Additionally, the use of `gmalloc` is a concern because it is not a standard C++ memory allocation function. If `gmalloc` is not properly implemented to handle large allocations and potential integer overflows, it could lead to vulnerabilities such as denial of service (DoS) or even arbitrary code execution if the program crashes or behaves unexpectedly.

In summary, the vulnerability in the code is due to the potential for integer overflow in the calculation of `rowSize`, which could lead to incorrect","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177826,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the code is vulnerable due to a stack-based buffer overflow.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `sprintf` function in the following line:

```cpp
sprintf(pathName, destFileName, pageNo);
```

The `sprintf` function is used to format the `pathName` string by inserting the `pageNo` value into the `destFileName` string. However, the `destFileName` string may not have enough space to accommodate the additional characters from `pageNo`. If `pageNo` is a multi-digit number, it could cause the `sprintf` function to write beyond the bounds of the `pathName` buffer, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (crash) by crafting a malicious `srcFileName` or `destFileName` that triggers the buffer overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use a safer alternative to `sprintf`, such as `snprintf`, which allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to be written to the buffer, preventing buffer overflows. Here's an example of how to use `snprintf`:

```cpp
snprintf(pathName, sizeof(pathName), ""%s%d"", destFileName, pageNo);
```

This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack, as an attacker can craft a long `encrypted_data` input to overflow the stack and potentially execute arbitrary code or crash the application.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the length of `encrypted_data` does not exceed the size of the `password` buffer before calling `RSA_private_decrypt`.

The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to a DoS attack based on the information given. The vulnerability in the original code was related to the handling of '\0' characters in the pattern matching function, which could lead to buffer over-reads. However, the revised code correctly handles the '\0' character by returning the result of the comparison between the current character and '\0', and it also correctly decrements the `patdashes` and `stringdashes` counters.

The `sumGame` function is unrelated to the pattern matching function and does not contain any apparent vulnerabilities. It is a separate function that calculates the outcome of a game based on a given string of numbers.","The code contains a DoS vulnerability.

The `sumGame` function is a separate function that calculates the difference between two halves of a string of numbers, where one or both halves may contain '?'. This function does not have any vulnerabilities related to DoS or Overflow, as it only processes the input string and does not allocate memory or perform any operations that could lead to a buffer overflow or DoS condition.

The provided code is vulnerable due to a potential integer overflow issue. The vulnerability arises from the following lines:

```cpp
length = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
p      = table + 16;
count  = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
```

In this code, `TT_NEXT_ULONG` is a macro that reads an unsigned long integer from the byte array `table`. The vulnerability occurs when the input `table` contains large values that cause the `length` and `count` variables to overflow.

For example, if the input `table` contains a large value that causes `length` to overflow, the subsequent check:

```cpp
if ( table + length > valid->limit || length < 20 + count * 2 )
```

may not behave as expected, leading to incorrect validation results.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the values read by `TT_NEXT_ULONG` do not cause integer overflow. You can do this by adding checks to ensure that the values are within the expected range before performing arithmetic operations on them.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The provided C++ code for the `move_uploaded_file` function does not appear to be vulnerable to the Bypass.cpp vulnerability described in the CVE-2015-2348. The code includes checks for the existence of the file in the `rfc1867_uploaded_files` hash and ensures that the new path is within the allowed open_basedir if set. Additionally, the code handles file permissions and ownership correctly.

However, it is important to note that the actual vulnerability lies in the PHP function `move_uploaded_file` itself, not in the C++ implementation. The vulnerability is due to the PHP function's handling of file paths containing null bytes, which can be exploited to bypass file extension restrictions. The C++ code provided here is just a wrapper for the PHP function and does not directly address the vulnerability in the PHP function.

To mitigate the vulnerability, you should ensure that you are using a patched version of PHP that includes the fix for CVE-2015-2348.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-2348. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.
Vulnerability summary:
The move_uploaded_file implementation in ext/standard/basic_functions.c in PHP before 5.4.39, 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 truncates a pathname upon encountering a \x00 character, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended extension restrictions and create files with unexpected names via a crafted second argument.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-7243.

The provided C++ code for the `sumGame` function is not vulnerable to the specific issue described in the CVE-2017-7564. The vulnerability mentioned in the CVE-2017-7564 is related to the OpenSSL library's handling of the `EVP_Seal` function, which is not present in the given `sumGame` function. The `sumGame` function is a logic puzzle solver and does not involve any cryptographic operations or OpenSSL library usage.","The code contains a nan vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2017-11144. The CWE-ID is CWE-754.
Vulnerability summary:
In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, the openssl extension PEM sealing code did not check the return value of the OpenSSL sealing function, which could lead to a crash of the PHP interpreter, related to an interpretation conflict for a negative number in ext/openssl/openssl.c, and an OpenSSL documentation omission.
