177740,DoS Exec Code Overflow Mem. Corr.," YES

The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to a potential buffer overflow. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `strbuf` pointer, which is allocated using `estrdup` to duplicate the string pointed to by `timestr->data`. The `estrdup` function allocates memory for the new string and copies the content of the original string into it. However, there is no check to ensure that the size of the allocated memory is sufficient to hold the copied string, including the null terminator.

If the length of the string pointed to by `timestr->data` is greater than the size of the allocated memory, the `strbuf` pointer will point to a buffer that is not large enough to hold the entire string. This can lead to a buffer overflow when the `atoi` function is called on the `thestr` pointer, which is a pointer to a part of the `strbuf` buffer.

A buffer overflow can lead to memory corruption, which may result in a denial of service (DoS) or even arbitrary code execution, depending on the context in which the function is used and the surrounding code.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the allocated memory for `strbuf` is large enough to hold the entire string, including the null terminator. Additionally, it would be safer to use safer string handling functions, such as `strncpy`,","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow_Mem._Corr. vulnerability.

177742,DoS Overflow," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in the provided code is similar to the one in the original function. The issue arises from the fact that the size of the buffer (`session_data_size`) is not verified before copying data into it. If a malicious server sends a large `SessionTicket`, the `memcpy` operation could write more data than the allocated buffer can hold, leading to a buffer overflow.

In the provided code, the check `if (psession.size > *session_data_size)` is present, but it is not sufficient to prevent the vulnerability. The problem is that the `psession.size` is not necessarily the same as the size of the data that needs to be copied. The `gnutls_datum_t` structure contains a `size` field, which is the size of the data it points to, but the `memcpy` operation uses `psession.size` as the number of bytes to copy. If the `psession.size` is larger than the actual data size, it could still lead to a buffer overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the size of the data to be copied is not larger than the size of the buffer. This can be done by using the actual size of the data pointed by `psession.data` instead of `psession.size` in the `memcpy`","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

177743,DoS," YES

The provided code is vulnerable to a Time-Memory Tradeoff (TMT) attack, specifically a type of side-channel attack known as a cache timing attack. This vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses conditional branches based on the values of the elements in the array, which can lead to variable execution times depending on the input data. An attacker could potentially exploit this behavior to gain information about the secret values in the array by measuring the execution time of the function.

In the `guessMajority` function, the execution time can vary depending on the values of the elements in the array. For example, the loop that iterates over the array and compares the values at indices 0, 1, 2, and i (or 3) can take different amounts of time depending on whether the values are equal or not. An attacker could use this information to deduce the values of the array elements by carefully crafting inputs and measuring the execution time of the function.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use constant-time algorithms that do not rely on conditional branches based on the values of the elements in the array. This can be achieved by using bitwise operations and avoiding data-dependent branching. Additionally, the code should be carefully reviewed and tested to ensure that it does not leak any sensitive information through side channels.","The code contains a DoS vulnerability.

The provided code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the recursive nature of the `ldap_parse_tree` function. An attacker can craft a malicious LDAP filter with a deeply nested structure, causing the function to recurse indefinitely and potentially exhaust system resources, leading to a DoS condition.

For example, an attacker could create a filter with a nested structure like this:

```
(&(objectClass=person)(|(cn=*)(|(sn=*)(|(givenName=*)(cn=*))))
```

This filter would cause the `ldap_parse_tree` function to recurse deeply, as it would need to process the nested conditions in the filter. The recursive calls would continue until the system's stack memory is exhausted, leading to a crash or a DoS condition.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `ldap_parse_tree` function should be modified to include a depth limit or a maximum recursion depth to prevent excessive recursion. Additionally, the LDAP server should be configured to handle malformed or maliciously crafted LDAP filters appropriately.","The code contains a DoS vulnerability.

The provided code is vulnerable due to the potential for stack exhaustion caused by recursive calls in the `dns_read_name` function. The vulnerability arises from the handling of compressed pointers, which can lead to infinite recursion or a long chain of valid pointers being processed.

In the `dns_read_name` function, the line:

```c++
n = dns_read_name(buffer, bufend, buffer + reader[1], dest, dest_len - nb_bytes, offset);
```

causes a recursive call to the same function with a new buffer pointer (`buffer + reader[1]`). If the compressed pointer points to a location within the buffer that contains a valid pointer to itself, the function will keep recursively calling itself with the same buffer, leading to infinite recursion.

Additionally, if the compressed pointer points to a valid chain of pointers, the function will keep recursively calling itself with each pointer in the chain, potentially leading to stack exhaustion.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to handle compressed pointers more securely, ensuring that recursive calls do not lead to infinite recursion or excessive stack usage.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

The provided C++ code is vulnerable to a DoS (Denial of Service) attack due to a potential integer overflow issue. The function `guessMajority` uses an `ArrayReader` object to query values from an array. The loop iterates from `reader.length() - 1` down to `4`, and within the loop, it queries values using indices that are calculated based on the loop variable `i`.

The vulnerability arises when the `reader.query` function is called with indices that may exceed the bounds of the array. If the `reader.length()` is less than `4`, the function will attempt to access elements outside the bounds of the array, which can lead to undefined behavior, including a DoS attack if the function is part of a larger system that relies on the correctness of this function.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add a check to ensure that the indices used in the `reader.query` calls are within the bounds of the array:

The code does not exhibit any clear integer overflows or other vulnerabilities that would lead to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution. The memory allocation for `cairo_data` is done with `gmalloc`, which should handle the allocation size properly, and the checks for `transparent` ensure that the memory is initialized correctly.

However, without a full context of the codebase and the environment in which this function operates, it is not possible to definitively say that there are no vulnerabilities.

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflow, which can lead to a DoS (Denial of Service) or potentially arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability arises from the calculation of `rowSize` and the subsequent memory allocation using `gmalloc`.

In the `SplashBitmap` constructor, `rowSize` is calculated based on the `mode` and then adjusted by `rowPad`. The calculation of `rowSize` can result in an integer overflow if the width and rowPad values are large enough. This overflow can lead to a negative `rowSize` or a smaller `rowSize` than expected, which in turn affects the memory allocation.

The line `data = (SplashColorPtr)gmalloc(rowSize * height);` allocates memory based on the calculated `rowSize`. If `rowSize` is negative or smaller than expected due to integer overflow, this can lead to a memory allocation error or a smaller buffer than needed. This can cause a DoS if the program crashes when trying to access or write to this buffer, or it could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if the program writes beyond the allocated buffer and overwrites adjacent memory.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add checks to ensure that `rowSize` does not overflow and that the memory allocation is successful. Additionally, you should consider using safer memory allocation functions that can handle large sizes and provide error","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to an integer overflow. The vulnerability arises from the calculation of the variable `n` which is used to determine the number of pixels to read from the file. The line `n = image->width * image->height;` calculates the total number of pixels by multiplying the width and height of the image. If either `width` or `height` is a very large value, the multiplication could result in an integer overflow, leading to a negative value for `n`. This would cause the subsequent loop to behave unexpectedly, potentially leading to a buffer overflow when accessing the `pixels` array.

In the context of the vulnerability summary provided, the integer overflow could lead to heap buffer overflows when processing malicious cursors, as mentioned in the summary. This is because the code does not properly validate the size of the image data before reading it, which could be exploited by an attacker to cause a buffer overflow.","The code contains a Overflow vulnerability.

The provided code snippet is vulnerable due to the use of `snprintf` with a format string that does not properly handle the formatting of the `pageNo` variable. This can lead to a format string vulnerability if `destFileName` contains format specifiers that are not properly escaped or if `pageNo` is not a valid integer.

In the `extractPages` function, the `snprintf` call is as follows:

```cpp
snprintf(pathName, sizeof(pathName) - 1, destFileName, pageNo);
```

This line is intended to create a filename for each page extracted from the PDF document. However, if `destFileName` contains format specifiers (like `%d`), and `pageNo` is not a valid integer, it could lead to a format string vulnerability.

For example, if `destFileName` is something like `""page%d.pdf""` and `pageNo` is a string or a non-integer value, the `snprintf` call could be misused to execute arbitrary code or cause a crash.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that `destFileName` does not contain any format specifiers, or if it does, you should properly escape them.

However, the `destFileName` string may not have enough space to accommodate the additional characters from `pageNo`. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the resulting string exceeds the size of the `pathName` buffer (1024 bytes).

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the `snprintf` function instead of `sprintf`, which allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to be written to the buffer:

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it handles string lengths and memory allocation. The vulnerability arises from the assumption that the size of the output string will not exceed twice the size of the input string (`2*(n+1)`). This assumption may not hold true for all inputs, especially when dealing with multi-byte characters or when the input contains characters that require more than one byte to represent in memory.

In the `strupper_talloc_n_handle` function, the `talloc_array` function is used to allocate memory for the destination string, which is based on the assumption that the size of the output string will not exceed twice the size of the input string. However, this assumption may not hold true for all inputs, especially when dealing with multi-byte characters or when the input contains characters that require more than one byte to represent in memory.

If the assumption fails, the `talloc_realloc` function may not be able to correctly reallocate the memory for the destination string, leading to potential memory corruption or other unintended behavior. This can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code.

The provided code snippet is vulnerable due to the way it handles the `sharename` pointer. The code attempts to modify the `sharename` pointer by incrementing it after duplicating the `share` string. However, the `sharename` pointer is not initialized with a valid memory address before it is used. This can lead to undefined behavior, as the pointer may point to an invalid memory location.

Additionally, the code does not check if the `talloc_strdup` function call was successful, which could result in a NULL pointer being dereferenced if memory allocation fails. This could lead to a segmentation fault or other memory-related issues.

Moreover, the code does not properly handle the case where the `server` parameter is NULL. If `server` is NULL, the code assigns `sharename` to it, which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference if `sharename` is not properly initialized.

These issues can potentially lead to vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, memory leaks, or crashes, which can be exploited by attackers.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

The provided code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability (CVE-ID: CVE-2015-5252, CWE-ID: CWE-264). The vulnerability arises from the use of the `SMB_VFS_REALPATH` function without proper validation of the resolved path. This can allow an attacker to bypass file access restrictions by creating a symbolic link that points outside of the intended share.

In the code, the `SMB_VFS_REALPATH` function is called with the argument `"".""`, which means it will return the absolute path of the current working directory. If an attacker can manipulate the current working directory or the symbolic links in the file system, they may be able to trick the application into accessing files outside of the intended share.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the resolved path returned by `SMB_VFS_REALPATH` to ensure it is within the intended share directory. This can be done by checking if the resolved path starts with the expected share directory path or by using other methods to verify the path's legitimacy.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it handles the execution of an external command using the `execl` function. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `editor_program` string is constructed by concatenating the `editor_program` constant with the `outname` file path and a potential command-line argument (`"" - ""`). If an attacker can control the `outname` file path, they could inject additional shell commands into the `editor_program` string.

For example, if an attacker sets `outname` to something like `""; rm -rf / #"", the resulting `editor_program` string would be `""ed_program ; rm -rf / #""`. When the `execl` function is called, it would execute both the `ed` command and the `rm -rf /` command, leading to a potential system-wide deletion of files.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly sanitize the `outname` file path and ensure that it does not contain any shell metacharacters or command injections. Additionally, the code should use a safer method for executing external commands, such as using the `execvp` function with a fixed command and arguments, or using a library that provides a higher-level abstraction for command execution with proper argument handling.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

The provided code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles the '\0' character in the pattern matching function. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code incorrectly skips '\0' characters when processing '?' characters in the pattern. This can lead to buffer over-reads, causing the program to read beyond the end of the input string, which can result in information disclosure or a crash.

In the original vulnerable code, the issue was that when a '?' character was encountered in the pattern, the code would decrement the `stringdashes` counter if the next character in the string was '\0'. This would cause the pattern matching function to continue processing the string even after reaching the end, leading to a potential buffer over-read.

In the modified code you provided, the same issue still exists. The line:

```cpp
if (*string++ == XK_minus)
    stringdashes--;
```

is still present, which means that if the next character after a '?' in the pattern is '\0', the `stringdashes` counter will be decremented, potentially causing a buffer over-read.

The code is a modified version of the `zsetcolor` function, which sets the color in the Ghostscript interpreter. The modifications include additional checks and validations that were not present in the original code.

The original code contained a vulnerability due to a type confusion in the `setcolor` function, which could be exploited by crafting a PostScript file with a specific color space that would cause the interpreter to crash or behave unpredictably. However, the modified code includes additional checks and validations to prevent this type of vulnerability.

In this line, the function `TT_NEXT_ULONG` is used to read an unsigned long integer from the `table` array. If the input data contains a value that is too large to be represented by an unsigned long integer, it will cause an integer overflow. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as incorrect values being read or even memory corruption.

The provided code is vulnerable due to a potential buffer overflow. The vulnerability arises from the way the code reads data into the buffer `ch` without proper bounds checking. The code assumes that the length of the data read from the server (`rep.length`) will not exceed the allocated buffer size (`nbytes`). However, if the server sends more data than expected, it could lead to a buffer overflow, which is a classic security vulnerability.

In the code, `nbytes` is calculated as `(unsigned long) rep.length << 2`, which means it allocates space for the length of the data times four (assuming each character is 4 bytes). The code then reads the data into `ch` using `_XReadPad(dpy, ch, nbytes);`. If `rep.length` is larger than the actual size of the data being sent, the code will still allocate `nbytes` and attempt to read that much data, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.

This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending a specially crafted response that includes more data than the buffer can hold.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

Additionally, the code does not check for integer overflow when calculating the length of the extensions. If `rep.length` is very large, the calculation of `length = *ch;` could also overflow, leading to incorrect behavior when unpacking the strings.
