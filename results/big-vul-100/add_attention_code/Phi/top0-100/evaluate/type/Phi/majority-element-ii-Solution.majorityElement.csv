The provided code is vulnerable due to a potential buffer overflow. The function `asn1_right_to_time_t` assumes that the input string `timestr->data` is a valid ASN.1 time string and attempts to parse it without checking the length of the string. If the input string is longer than expected, the `strbuf` buffer may not be large enough to hold the entire string, leading to a buffer overflow when `strdup` is called. This can result in memory corruption and potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

Additionally, the function uses `atoi` to parse the time components from the string, which does not handle errors or invalid input gracefully. If the input string contains non-numeric characters or is malformed, the function may return incorrect values or cause undefined behavior.

To fix these vulnerabilities, the function should validate the input string length and content before parsing, and use safer string parsing functions that handle errors and invalid input more gracefully.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow_Mem._Corr. vulnerability.

The provided code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack, similar to the vulnerability in the original `gnutls_session_get_data` function. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly check the size of the `session_data` buffer before copying data into it. If an attacker can control the `psession.size` value, they could cause a buffer overflow by setting it to a value larger than the actual size of the `session_data` buffer provided. This could lead to a denial of service (application crash) or potentially allow arbitrary code execution, depending on the system and compiler used.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `session_data_size` is always correctly set to the size of the `session_data` buffer before calling this function. Additionally, you should add a check to ensure that `psession.size` does not exceed the `session_data_size` before performing the `memcpy` operation.","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

The provided code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack, similar to the vulnerability described in the original code snippet. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly validate the size of the `session_data` buffer before copying data into it. If an attacker can control the `psession.size` value, they could potentially set it to a value larger than the actual size of the `session_data` buffer provided by the caller. This would result in a buffer overflow when the `memcpy` function is called, leading to a potential crash or other unintended behavior, which is a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, the function should ensure that `psession.size` does not exceed the size of the `session_data` buffer before performing the copy operation. This can be done by adding an additional check before the `memcpy` call:

```cpp
if (psession.size > *session_right_size) {

The provided code snippet for `SplashBitmap::SplashBitmap` constructor is vulnerable to integer overflow, which can lead to a denial of service (DoS) or potentially arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability arises from the calculation of `rowSize` and the subsequent memory allocation using `gmalloc`.

In the code, `rowSize` is calculated based on the `mode` and the `width` of the bitmap. The calculation involves multiplication and addition, which can lead to integer overflow if the values of `width` and `rowSize` are large enough.

For example, in the case of `splashModeRGB8` or `splashModeBGR8`, `rowSize` is calculated as `width * 3`. If `width` is a large value, the multiplication can cause an integer overflow, resulting in an incorrect `rowSize` value.

Similarly, in the case of `splashModeXBGR8` or `splashModeCMYK8`, `rowSize` is calculated as `width * 4`. Again, if `width` is a large value, the multiplication can cause an integer overflow, resulting in an incorrect `rowSize` value.

After calculating `rowSize`, the code adds `rowPad - 1` to it and then subtracts the remainder of `rowSize` divided by `rowPad`. This can","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177796,Overflow," YES

The provided code snippet for `nfs_readlink_req` contains a vulnerability similar to the one described in the original code. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `len` variable, which is calculated as the difference between the pointer `p` (after adding credentials and file handle) and the address of the first element of the `data` array. This length is then used to allocate memory for the `target` pointer without proper bounds checking.

The vulnerability is a buffer overflow, as the length of the data read from the network is used directly to allocate memory for the `target` pointer. If the length is larger than the size of the `data` array (1024 bytes), it will result in a buffer overflow, potentially leading to a crash or allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, proper bounds checking should be added to ensure that the length of the data read from the network does not exceed the size of the `data` array. Additionally, the code should handle the case where the length is larger than the size of the `data` array, either by truncating the data or by allocating a larger buffer.","The code contains a Overflow vulnerability.

177825,DoS," YES, the provided C++ code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of the `snprintf` function within the `extractPages` function. The `snprintf` function is used to format the `pathName` string with the page number, which is then used to create a `GooString` object. The issue arises when the `destFileName` does not contain the `%d` format specifier, and the user provides a filename that can be manipulated to cause a buffer overflow.

For example, if a user provides a filename like `../../../../etc/passwd`, the resulting `pathName` would be `../../../../etc/passwd1`, `../../../../etc/passwd2`, etc., depending on the page number. This could potentially overwrite critical memory areas, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `destFileName` contains the `%d` format specifier, and you should also validate the input to prevent directory traversal attacks. Additionally, consider using safer string formatting functions like `snprintf_s` or `vsnprintf` that include buffer size parameters to prevent buffer overflows.","The code contains a DoS vulnerability.

177826,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided C++ code is vulnerable due to a stack-based buffer overflow.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `sprintf` function in the following line:

```cpp
sprintf(pathName, destFileName, pageNo);
```

The `sprintf` function is used to format a string and store the result in `pathName`. However, `pathName` is a fixed-size buffer of 1024 characters. If the resulting string (including the page number) exceeds this size, it will cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) or even arbitrary code execution.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use a safer alternative like `snprintf`, which allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to be written to the buffer:

```cpp
snprintf(pathName, sizeof(pathName), ""%s%d"", destFileName, pageNo);
```

This change ensures that the buffer will not be overflowed, preventing the vulnerability.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it handles the '*' and '?' characters in the pattern matching function. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not correctly handle the case where the '*' character is followed by a '?' character in the pattern. This can lead to a buffer over-read, which is a type of vulnerability that can cause information disclosure or a denial of service.

In the original vulnerable code, when a '*' character is encountered, the code checks for a 'XK_minus' character to determine if the '*' should be treated as a '*' or as a '?'. However, in the provided code, the check for 'XK_minus' is missing after encountering a '*' character. This means that if a '*' is followed by a '?' in the pattern, the code will not correctly handle the '?' character, potentially leading to a buffer over-read.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add a check for 'XK_minus' after encountering a '*' character in the pattern. This will ensure that the '*' character is correctly handled as a '*' or as a '?', preventing the buffer over-read vulnerability.","The code contains a DoS vulnerability.

The provided C++ code for `drm_load_edid_firmware` is vulnerable due to the unchecked use of `kstrdup`. The `kstrdup` function is used to duplicate a string, but if the source string (`edid_firmware`) is not properly null-terminated or if it contains a null byte, `kstrdup` may return a pointer that does not point to a properly null-terminated string. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference when the function tries to access the string, potentially causing a denial of service (DoS) or system crash.

In the context of the Linux kernel, such vulnerabilities can be particularly dangerous because they can be exploited to crash the kernel, leading to a system crash or denial of service. The CVE-ID CVE-2019-12382 and CWE-ID CWE-476 associated with this vulnerability highlight the severity of the issue.

The vulnerability arises from the assumption that the `edid_firmware` string is well-formed and properly null-terminated. If this assumption is incorrect, the code may behave unexpectedly and lead to a security issue.","The code contains a DoS vulnerability.

The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to a DoS overflow as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2015-3228. The code includes a check to prevent integer overflow when calculating the new memory size to allocate:

```c
if (size > mmem->limit - sizeof(gs_malloc_block_t)) {
    /* Definitely too large to allocate; also avoids overflow. */
    set_msg(""exceeded limit"");
 } else {
     uint added = size + sizeof(gs_malloc_block_t);
     if (mmem->limit - added < mmem->used)

     else if ((ptr = (byte *) Memento_label(malloc(added), cname)) == 0)

The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to the way it handles XML parsing, which can lead to an XML External Entity (XXE) attack. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` function without proper validation or sanitization of the input filename. An attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious XML file that includes an external entity reference, which, when processed by the parser, could lead to unauthorized access to the file system or other resources.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-ID CVE-2013-1824, where the SOAP parser in PHP before version 5.3.22 and 5.4.x before version 5EE-12 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a SOAP WSDL file containing an XML external entity declaration.

The provided code is vulnerable due to a potential integer overflow in the calculation of `d0` and `d1`. The expression `(255 << 23) / xp` and `(255 << 23) / (xp + 1)` can cause an integer overflow if `xp` is too large. This is because the left shift operation `255 << 23` results in a very large number, and dividing by `xp` or `xp + 1` may not be enough to prevent the overflow.

Additionally, the code does not check for division by zero, which could occur if `xp` is zero. This would lead to undefined behavior and could potentially cause a crash.

Moreover, the code does not handle the case where `srcWidth` is not a multiple of `srcHeight`, which could lead to incorrect memory accesses and potential buffer overflows.

The vulnerability lies in the following lines:

```cpp
length = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
p      = table + 16;
count  = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
```

In this code, `TT_NEXT_ULONG` is a macro that reads an unsigned long integer from the memory location pointed by `p`. The `p` pointer is initially set to `table + 4`, and then it is incremented by 16.

The vulnerability arises when the input `table` is a specially crafted buffer that contains a large value in the first 4 bytes, followed by a large value in the next 4 bytes (at the position `table + 16`). In this case, the `length` variable will be set to a very large value, which may cause an integer overflow when it is used in the subsequent condition:

```cpp
if ( table + length > valid->limit || length < 20 + count * 2 )
```

If the `length` variable overflows, it may lead to an incorrect comparison and potentially allow an attacker to bypass the validation check. This could result in an integer overflow vulnerability, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

The provided code is vulnerable due to the potential for an out-of-bounds write, which can lead to a denial of service or remote code execution. The vulnerability is related to the handling of the `rlen` variable and the subsequent memory allocation and access.

In the `XListExtensions` function, the `rlen` variable is calculated as `rep.length << 2`. This operation assumes that `rep.length` is a valid unsigned integer value. However, if `rep.length` is a signed integer and it contains a negative value, the left shift operation could result in an incorrect `rlen` value that is too large, leading to an out-of-bounds write when allocating memory for `ch`.

Moreover, the code does not check if the allocated memory for `ch` is sufficient to hold the data read by `_XReadPad`. If the actual data size is larger than the allocated memory, it could also lead to an out-of-bounds write.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that `rep.length` is a valid unsigned integer and that the allocated memory for `ch` is sufficient to hold the data read by `_XReadPad`.

The provided C++ code is vulnerable due to a potential buffer overflow in the `add_param_to_argv` function. The vulnerability arises from the use of a fixed-size buffer `param_buffer[1024]` to store parameters parsed from the input string. If the input string contains more than 1024 characters, the code will write beyond the bounds of the `param_buffer` array, leading to a buffer overflow. This can result in undefined behavior, including crashes or, in the worst case, arbitrary code execution if an attacker crafts the input carefully.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-ID CVE-2019-11360, where a buffer overflow in iptables-restore in netfilter iptables 1.8.2 allows an attacker to crash the program or potentially gain code execution via a specially crafted iptables-save file.

To fix this vulnerability, you should consider using safer alternatives to C-style strings and buffers, such as `std::string` and `std::vector<char>`, which can dynamically resize to accommodate the input data. Additionally, you should validate the input data to ensure it does not exceed the expected size before processing it.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2019-11360. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The provided C++ code for the `majorityElement` function is not vulnerable to the specific vulnerability described in the PHP code snippet. The PHP code snippet contains a potential vulnerability related to the handling of the `EVP_SealInit` function, which could lead to an integer overflow or misinterpretation of the return value, potentially causing a crash or unexpected behavior. However, the C++ code provided for finding the majority element in a vector does not involve any similar cryptographic operations or handling of sensitive data that could lead to a similar vulnerability.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.
