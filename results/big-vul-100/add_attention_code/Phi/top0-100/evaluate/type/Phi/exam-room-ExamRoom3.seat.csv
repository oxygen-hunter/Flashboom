The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow_Mem._Corr. vulnerability described in the original code snippet. The vulnerability in the original code was related to improper parsing of time strings in X.509 certificates, which could lead to memory corruption or arbitrary code execution.

The provided code snippet is a function that seems to be part of a seat reservation system, where `seats_` is a map that keeps track of seat assignments, and `max_heap_` is a priority queue that helps in finding the next available seat. The function `seat()` is responsible for assigning a seat to a passenger.

The vulnerability in the original code was due to the use of `atoi` for parsing time strings without proper validation, which could lead to buffer overflows or incorrect parsing of the time string. In contrast, the provided code snippet does not involve parsing of external input strings or handling of time data. Instead, it deals with seat assignments and maintaining a heap for efficient retrieval of available seats.

The provided code is vulnerable due to the potential for infinite recursion in the `dns_read_name` function. This vulnerability arises from the handling of compressed DNS names, which can lead to a crafted packet that causes the function to enter an infinite loop or exhaust the stack.

In the `dns_read_name` function, the line `n = dns_read_name(buffer, bufend, buffer + reader[1], dest, dest_len - nb_bytes, offset);` can cause infinite recursion if the pointer `buffer + reader[1]` points to a compressed DNS name that references itself. This can happen when a compressed pointer points to a label that is part of the domain name itself, creating a loop that the function will never exit.

Additionally, the function does not have a proper mechanism to handle the case when the compressed pointer points to a label that is not part of the domain name, which can also lead to stack exhaustion.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly handle compressed DNS names and ensure that the recursion does not lead to infinite loops or stack exhaustion. This can be achieved by implementing a mechanism to detect and handle compressed pointers, and by adding proper checks to prevent infinite recursion.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflow, which can lead to a denial of service (DoS) or potentially arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability arises from the calculation of `cairo_width` and `cairo_height` without proper checks for overflow when multiplying `width` and `height` by `scale`. If `scale` is a large value, the multiplication could overflow the `int` data type, leading to incorrect values for `cairo_width` and `cairo_height`. This could result in an invalid surface being created, which might cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add checks to ensure that the multiplication does not cause an overflow. For example, you could use a larger integer type for the calculations or implement a function to safely multiply integers and detect overflow.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The provided code snippet for the `SplashBitmap` constructor is vulnerable to integer overflow, which can lead to a DoS (Denial of Service) or potentially arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability arises from the calculation of `rowSize` and the subsequent memory allocation using `gmalloc`.

In the `switch` statement, `rowSize` is calculated based on the `mode` and the `width`. The calculation for `splashModeCMYK8` is `rowSize = width * 4;`. If `width` is large enough, the multiplication can cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect `rowSize` value.

Later in the code, `rowSize` is modified by adding `rowPad - 1` and then adjusting it to be a multiple of `rowPad` by subtracting the remainder of `rowSize % rowPad`. This could potentially lead to a negative `rowSize` if the initial calculation was incorrect due to overflow.

Finally, `gmalloc` is used to allocate memory for `data` and `alpha` based on `rowSize * height`. If `rowSize` is negative or too large due to overflow, this can result in a failure to allocate the correct amount of memory, leading to a DoS condition or, in some cases, arbitrary code execution if the memory allocation function behaves unpredictably.

177826,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided code is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `sprintf` function call within the `for` loop:

```cpp
sprintf (pathName, destFileName, pageNo);
```

The `sprintf` function is used to format the `pathName` string, which is a fixed-size buffer of 1024 characters. The `destFileName` is expected to contain a format specifier `%d` to indicate where the `pageNo` should be inserted. However, if the `destFileName` does not contain the `%d` format specifier, or if the resulting string after inserting `pageNo` exceeds 1024 characters, the `sprintf` function will write past the end of the `pathName` buffer. This can lead to a stack-based buffer overflow, which can cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly allow arbitrary code execution.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use a safer alternative to `sprintf`, such as `snprintf`, which allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to write to the buffer, preventing buffer overflows:

```cpp
snprintf (pathName, sizeof(pathName), destFileName, pageNo);
```

The vulnerability lies in the handling of the string length and the escape sequence processing. The function `ldb_dn_escape_internal` is designed to escape certain characters in a string, but it does not properly handle the case where the input string length (`len`) is incorrect or when the input string is not properly null-terminated.

The function assumes that the input string `src` is properly null-terminated and that the length `len` provided is accurate. If `len` is greater than the actual length of the string, the function may read beyond the end of the string, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability. This can be exploited by an attacker to read or manipulate memory, potentially leading to information disclosure or code execution.

Additionally, the function does not check if the destination buffer `dst` is large enough to hold the escaped string. If `dst` is not large enough, this could also lead to a buffer overflow when copying the escaped string into `dst`.

The provided code snippet does not show the full context of the `seat` function, but if it is related to the same vulnerability, it would be important to ensure that the `seats_` map and `max_heap_` are properly managed to prevent similar issues.

177879,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `pos` variable when `FD_MSR_NONDMA` is set. The code correctly wraps `pos` around using the modulo operator `%` to ensure it stays within the bounds of the sector size. However, the vulnerability arises from the fact that the `pos` variable is not checked for bounds before being used as an index to access the `fifo` array.

In the line `retval = fdctrl->fifo[pos];`, if `pos` is greater than or equal to `FD_SECTOR_LEN`, it will lead to an out-of-bounds access, which can cause a buffer overflow. This can potentially lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) or even arbitrary code execution, as mentioned in the provided vulnerability summary.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add a bounds check before accessing the `fifo` array:

```cpp
if (pos >= FD_SECTOR_LEN) {
    pos = 0;
}
retval = fdctrl->fifo[pos];
```

This will ensure that `pos` is always within the valid range of the `fifo` array, preventing out-of-bounds access and the associated vulnerabilities.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177891,DoS," YES

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles the decoding of the RSA PSS parameters. The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2015-31EE, where the absence of a mask generation function (MGF) parameter in the RSA PSS signature can lead to a NULL pointer dereference and application crash.

In the code, the function `rsa_pss_decode` checks if the `maskGenAlgorithm` parameter is present in the RSA PSS signature. If it is not present, the function returns `NULL` without performing any further checks or handling the missing parameter. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference when the function is called by other parts of the code that expect a valid `RSA_PSS_PARAMS` structure.

To fix this vulnerability, the function should properly handle the case when the `maskGenAlgorithm` parameter is missing, either by providing a default value or by throwing an exception. This will prevent the application from crashing when encountering a signature without the MGF parameter.","The code contains a DoS vulnerability.

The provided code is vulnerable to the same type of vulnerability as the original code snippet. The vulnerability is related to XML External Entities (XXE), which can be exploited to read arbitrary files on the server.

In the provided code, the `PG(allow_url_fopen)` is set to `1`, which allows the parser to open URLs. This can be exploited by an attacker to pass a malicious XML file containing an external entity declaration that references a local file on the server. When the parser processes this XML file, it will attempt to access the local file, leading to a potential information disclosure vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `PG(allow_url_fopen)` is set to `0` or that the parser is configured to disable the processing of external entities. Additionally, you should update the PHP version to a version that has fixed this vulnerability (PHP 5.3.22 for CLI and 5.4.12 for Zend Engine).","The code contains a +Info vulnerability.

177907,DoS Exec Code Overflow," YES, the provided code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the way the code handles memory allocation and deallocation. Specifically, the code allocates memory for `lineBuf` using `gmalloc(srcWidth)` but does not check if the allocation was successful. If the allocation fails, the code will proceed to use `lineBuf` as if it were successfully allocated, which can lead to undefined behavior.

Additionally, the code uses `gfree(lineBuf)` to deallocate the memory at the end of the function. If the allocation was not successful, this will also lead to undefined behavior.

The vulnerability type is 'DoS' (Denial of Service) because if the memory allocation fails, the function may crash, causing the application to become unresponsive.

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to an integer overflow, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the following line:

```cpp
length = TT_NEXT_ULONG( p );
```

In this line, the function `TT_NEXT_ULONG` is used to read an unsigned long value from the `table` pointer. If the value of `length` exceeds the size of the buffer pointed to by `table`, it can lead to a buffer overflow when accessing the buffer using the `length` variable.

This vulnerability is similar to the one described in the original code snippet, where the integer overflow can lead to an out-of-bounds access of the buffer, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `length` variable does not exceed the size of the buffer.

The vulnerability lies in the following lines:

```cpp

and

```cpp

The function `TT_NEXT_ULONG` is used to read the next 4-byte unsigned long integer from the `table` array. However, the code does not check if the value read is within the valid range of an unsigned long integer (0 to 4294967295). If the input data contains a value that exceeds this range, an integer overflow can occur, leading to incorrect values being used in subsequent calculations.

For example, if the input data contains a value that is larger than 4294967295, the `length` and `num_groups` variables will hold incorrect values, which can cause the code to access invalid memory locations or perform incorrect calculations.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add checks to ensure that the values read by `TT_NEXT_ULONG` are within the valid range of an unsigned long integer.

The provided code snippet is vulnerable due to the potential for an out-of-bounds write, similar to the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-1EE80. The vulnerability arises from the handling of the `rlen` variable and the subsequent memory allocation and access.

In the code, `rlen` is calculated as `rep.length << 2`. This operation assumes that `rep.length` is a valid unsigned integer value. However, if `rep.length` is a signed integer and it contains a negative value, the left shift operation will not behave as expected, potentially leading to an incorrect `rlen` value.

Moreover, the code does not perform any bounds checking on the `ch` pointer before writing to it. The loop that copies the extension names into the `list` array assumes that the `ch` pointer points to a valid memory region of size `rlen + 1`. If `rlen` is incorrect due to the signed integer issue, this could lead to an out-of-bounds write, which is a classic vulnerability that can result in a denial of service or even remote code execution.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in CVE-2018-1EE80, where an out-of-bounds write occurred due to incorrect handling of an integer value. In this case, the integer is `","The code contains a Exec_Code vulnerability.

The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the 'nan' vulnerability described. The 'nan' vulnerability typically involves an off-by-one error that can lead to denial of service or other unspecified impacts. In the given code snippet, there is no clear indication of an off-by-one error or similar vulnerability. The code is handling memory allocation and deallocation properly, and the loop that processes the font names seems to be correctly bounded by the length of the data received.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

The provided code snippet for `XGetFontPath` is vulnerable due to a potential buffer overflow issue. The vulnerability arises from the way the function reads data into the buffer `ch` without proper bounds checking.

In the code, `nbytes` is calculated based on the value of `rep.length`, which is read from the response. The assumption is that `rep.length` contains the number of bytes to be read. However, if the server sends a malicious response with a `rep.length` value that is larger than the actual data size, the function `_XReadPad` will read more bytes into `ch` than it can hold. This can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and causing a crash or allowing arbitrary code execution.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the number of bytes read does not exceed the allocated size of the buffer `ch`. Additionally, the code should check that the value of `rep.length` is within a reasonable range before allocating memory and reading data.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

The provided C++ code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The vulnerability arises from the use of a fixed-size buffer `param_buffer[1024]` without proper bounds checking when copying characters into it. Although there is a check for `param_len >= sizeof(param_buffer)` before copying a null terminator, this check is not performed after each character is copied into the buffer. This means that if the input string `parsestart` is longer than 1023 characters (leaving space for the null terminator), it will cause a buffer overflow by writing past the end of the `param_buffer` array.

This can lead to undefined behavior, including memory corruption, crashes, and potentially code execution if an attacker crafts a carefully designed input to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the provided vulnerability summary (CVE-2019-11360), where a buffer overflow in iptables-restore allowed an attacker to crash the program or potentially gain code execution.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the buffer is not overflowed by checking the buffer size before each copy operation, not just before adding the null terminator. Additionally, using safer functions like `strncpy` or `snprintf` that limit the number of characters copied can help prevent buffer","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
