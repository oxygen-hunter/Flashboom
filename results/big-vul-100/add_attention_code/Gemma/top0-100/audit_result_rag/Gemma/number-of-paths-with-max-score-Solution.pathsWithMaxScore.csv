",1402,115,6.7786784172058105
177913,Exec Code Overflow,"YES
The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. 

The code uses `TT_NEXT_ULONG` to read a potentially large value from memory. If the value is larger than the allocated memory, it could overflow the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

Vulnerability summary:
A buffer overflow in iptables-restore in netfilter iptables 1.8.2 allows an attacker to (at least) crash the program or potentially gain code execution via a specially crafted iptables-save file. This is related to add_param_to_argv in xshared.c.

Vulnerability summary:
Integer overflow in the gst_vorbis_tag_add_coverart function (gst-libs/gst/tag/gstvorbistag.c) in vorbistag in gst-plugins-base (aka gstreamer-plugins-base) allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted COVERART tag that is converted from a base64 representation, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
