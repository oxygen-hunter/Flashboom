The SOAP parser in PHP before 5.3.22 and 5.4.x before 5.4.12 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a SOAP WSDL file containing an XML external entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference, related to an XML External Entity (XXE) issue in the soap_xmlParseFile and soap_xmlParseMemory functions. 


",1560,122,7.14104700088501
177900,+Info,"YES
The code contains a CWE-200 vulnerability. 

The code uses the `xmlParseDocument` function, which is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. 

Here's why:

* **XML External Entities (XXE):**  XML External Entities allow attackers to inject arbitrary code into the XML document. 
* **Vulnerability:** The code parses XML data from a buffer. If the buffer contains an XML External Entity (XXE) declaration, an attacker can manipulate the XML document to execute arbitrary code. 
* **CVE-ID:** CVE-2013-1824 
* **CWE-ID:** CWE-200
