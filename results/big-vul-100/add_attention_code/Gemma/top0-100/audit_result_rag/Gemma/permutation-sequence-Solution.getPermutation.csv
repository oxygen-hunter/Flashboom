Vulnerability summary:
Integer overflow in the gs_heap_alloc_bytes function in base/gsmalloc.c in Ghostscript 9.15 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted Postscript (ps) file, as demonstrated by using the ps2pdf command, which triggers an out-of-bounds read or write.

The code contains a CWE-200 vulnerability. 

The code uses the `xmlParseDocument` function, which is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. 

Here's why:

* **XML External Entities (XXE):**  XXE allows attackers to execute arbitrary code by manipulating XML documents. 
* **Vulnerability:** The code parses an XML document, potentially including external entities. An attacker could craft a malicious XML document with an external entity that references a file on the server. This could allow the attacker to read sensitive data or execute arbitrary code. 
* **CVE-ID:** CVE-2013-1824 
* **CWE-ID:** CWE-200

The code uses the `xmlParseDocument` function, which is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. 

Here's why:

* **XML External Entities (XXE):**  XML External Entities allow attackers to inject arbitrary code into your application. 
* **Vulnerability:** The code parses XML data from a buffer. If the buffer contains an XML External Entity (XXE) declaration, an attacker can manipulate the XML to execute arbitrary code.
