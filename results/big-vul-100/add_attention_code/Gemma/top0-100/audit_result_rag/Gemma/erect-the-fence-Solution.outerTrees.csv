Vulnerability summary:
psi/ztoken.c in Artifex Ghostscript 9.21 mishandles references to the scanner state structure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted PostScript document, related to an out-of-bounds read in the igc_reloc_struct_ptr function in psi/igc.c.

The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. 

The code uses `TT_NEXT_ULONG` to read a potentially large value from memory. If the value is larger than the allocated memory, it could overflow the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. 

The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.
Vulnerability summary:
Multiple integer overflows in FreeType 2.3.9 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to large values in certain inputs in (1) smooth/ftsmooth.c, (2) sfnt/ttcmap.c, and (3) cff/cffload.c.

Vulnerability summary:
A buffer overflow in iptables-restore in netfilter iptables 1.8.2 allows an attacker to (at least) crash the program or potentially gain code execution via a specially crafted iptables-save file. This is related to add_param_to_argv in xshared.c.

Vulnerability summary:
Integer overflow in the gst_vorbis_tag_add_coverart function (gst-libs/gst/tag/gstvorbistag.c) in vorbistag in gst-plugins-base (aka gstreamer-plugins-base) allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted COVERART tag that is converted from a base64 representation, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
