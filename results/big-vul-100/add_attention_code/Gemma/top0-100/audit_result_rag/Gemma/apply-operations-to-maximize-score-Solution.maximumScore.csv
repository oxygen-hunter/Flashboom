Vulnerability summary:
psi/ztoken.c in Artifex Ghostscript 9.21 mishandles references to the scanner state structure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted PostScript document, related to an out-of-bounds read in the igc_reloc_struct_ptr function in psi/igc.c.

Vulnerability summary:
Multiple integer overflows in FreeType 2.3.9 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to large values in certain inputs in (1) smooth/ftsmooth.c, (2) sfnt/ttcmap.c, and (3) cff/cffload.c.

The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. 

Here's why:

* **The code reads and writes data to memory:** The `FT_READ_USHORT` and `FT_READ_BYTE` functions read data from memory.
* **The code uses `FT_READ_USHORT` and `FT_READ_BYTE`:** These functions can read data from memory, potentially exceeding the allocated memory.
* **The code uses `FT_GET_USHORT`:** This function reads data from memory, potentially exceeding the allocated memory.


This code is vulnerable to buffer overflow because it reads and writes data to memory without proper bounds checking.

Vulnerability summary:
The move_uploaded_file implementation in ext/standard/basic_functions.c in PHP before 5.4.39, 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 truncates a pathname upon encountering a \x00 character, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended extension restrictions and create files with unexpected names via a crafted second argument.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-7243.
