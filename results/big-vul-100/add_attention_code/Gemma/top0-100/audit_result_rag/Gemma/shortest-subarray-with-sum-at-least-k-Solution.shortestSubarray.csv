The code contains a CWE-200 (Sensitive Data Exposure) vulnerability. 

Here's why:

* **XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability:** The code uses `xmlParseDocument` which can be exploited to read arbitrary files from the XML document. This is a classic XXE vulnerability. 
* **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can craft a malicious XML document with an external entity reference that points to a file on the server. This file could contain malicious code, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
