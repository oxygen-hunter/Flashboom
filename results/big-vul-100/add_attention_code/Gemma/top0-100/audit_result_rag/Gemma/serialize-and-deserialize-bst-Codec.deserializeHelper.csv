The code snippet you provided is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. 

Specifically, it's vulnerable to CVE-2015-5330, which allows attackers to read sensitive information from the daemon heap memory. 

Here's why:

* **Unbounded String Length:** The code assumes that the input string is limited to 5 bytes. However, it doesn't check the length of the input string before processing it.
* **Buffer Overflow:** If the input string is longer than 5 bytes, it could overflow the buffer allocated for the string. 
* **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker could craft a malicious string that exceeds the 5-byte limit, potentially overwriting memory and executing arbitrary code.

Here's why:

* **Unbounded String Input:** The code reads user input from `filename` and uses it to construct a string. 
* **Potential Overflow:** The code uses `malloc` to allocate memory for the string, but it doesn't check the size of the input. If the input string is longer than the allocated memory, it could overflow the buffer. 
* **CWE-120:** This vulnerability is a classic example of a buffer overflow.

Vulnerability summary:
In the PatternMatch function in fontfile/fontdir.c in libXfont through 1.5.2 and 2.x before 2.0.2, an attacker with access to an X connection can cause a buffer over-read during pattern matching of fonts, leading to information disclosure or a crash (denial of service).
