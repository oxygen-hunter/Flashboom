177859,Exec Code Bypass,"YES

The code contains a potential use-after-free vulnerability. 

Here's why:

* **Memory Allocation:** The code allocates memory using `gs_copydevice` and `gs_setdevice_no_erase`.
* **Potential Leak:** The code doesn't explicitly free the memory allocated for `ndev` after it's no longer needed. 
* **Use-After-Free:** The code uses `ndev` after it's been deallocated.

177860,Exec Code Bypass,"YES
The code contains a potential Exec Code Bypass vulnerability. 

The code uses functions like `restore_check_operand`, `restore_check_stack`, and `restore_fix_stack` which could be manipulated to execute arbitrary code. 

The CVE-ID is CVE-2018-16863. The CWE-ID is CWE-78.
Vulnerability summary:
It was found that RHSA-2018:2918 did not fully fix CVE-2018-16509. An attacker could possibly exploit another variant of the flaw and bypass the -dSAFER protection to, for example, execute arbitrary shell commands via a specially crafted PostScript document. This only affects ghostscript 9.07 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. 


",1280,177,10.195983648300171
177862,Exec Code,"YES
The code contains a potential use-after-free vulnerability. 

Here's why:

* **The code uses `dev_proc` to get a device pointer.** This function likely returns a pointer to a device object.
* **The code then calls `get_page_device` on the device pointer.** This function is likely responsible for retrieving the page device information.
* **The code then uses `dev_proc` again to get a device pointer.** This function likely returns a pointer to a device object.
* **The code then calls `get_page_device` on the device pointer.** This function is likely responsible for retrieving the page device information.

This pattern suggests that the code is using a pointer to a device object that is not properly managed. 

**Potential Exploitation:**

An attacker could craft malicious input to trigger a use-after-free error. For example, they could manipulate the device pointer to point to a memory location that has been freed. This could allow them to execute arbitrary code.
