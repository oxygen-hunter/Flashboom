Vulnerability summary:
GNU Tar through 1.30, when --sparse is used, mishandles file shrinkage during read access, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (infinite read loop in sparse_dump_region in sparse.c) by modifying a file that is supposed to be archived by a different user's process (e.g., a system backup running as root).

The code contains a potential use-after-free vulnerability. 

Here's why:

* **The code allocates memory using `new` and `malloc`.**
* **The code then uses pointers to access that memory.**
* **The code does not properly deallocate the memory after it is no longer needed.** 

This can lead to a use-after-free error, where the code tries to access memory that has already been deallocated.
