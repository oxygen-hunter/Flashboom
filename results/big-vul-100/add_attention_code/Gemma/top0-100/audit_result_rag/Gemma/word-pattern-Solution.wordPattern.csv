* **Potential Leak:** The code doesn't explicitly deallocate the memory allocated for `dev_old` and `dev_new` after they are no longer needed. 
* **Use-After-Free:** The code might access memory that has been deallocated, leading to a crash or unexpected behavior.

Vulnerability summary:
In the PatternMatch function in fontfile/fontdir.c in libXfont through 1.5.2 and 2.x before 2.0.2, an attacker with access to an X connection can cause a buffer over-read during pattern matching of fonts, leading to information disclosure or a crash (denial of service). This occurs because '\0' characters are incorrectly skipped in situations involving? characters.
