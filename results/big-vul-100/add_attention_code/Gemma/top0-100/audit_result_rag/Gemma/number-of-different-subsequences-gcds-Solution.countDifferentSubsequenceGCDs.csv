177900,+Info,"YES
The code contains a CWE-200 vulnerability. 

The code uses the `xmlParseDocument` function, which is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. 

Here's why:

* **XML External Entities (XXE):**  XML External Entities allow attackers to inject arbitrary code into the XML document. 
* **Vulnerability:** The code parses XML data from a buffer. If the buffer contains an XML External Entity (XXE) declaration, the parser will attempt to resolve it, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. 
* **CVE-ID:** CVE-2013-1824 
* **CWE-ID:** CWE-200
