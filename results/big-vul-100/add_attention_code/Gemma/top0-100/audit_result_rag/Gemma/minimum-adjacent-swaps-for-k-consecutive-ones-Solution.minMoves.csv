The code contains a CWE-200 vulnerability. 

The code uses the `xmlParseDocument` function, which is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. 

Here's why:

* **XML External Entities (XXE):**  XXE allows attackers to execute arbitrary code by manipulating XML documents. 
* **Vulnerability:** The code parses an XML document, potentially including external entities. An attacker could craft a malicious XML document that includes an external entity reference to a file on the server. This could allow the attacker to read sensitive data or execute arbitrary code. 
* **CVE-ID:** CVE-2013-1824 
* **CWE-ID:** CWE-200
