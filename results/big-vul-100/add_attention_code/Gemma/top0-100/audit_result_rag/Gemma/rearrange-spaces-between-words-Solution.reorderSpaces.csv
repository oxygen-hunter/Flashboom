* **Memory Management:** The code allocates memory for `softmask` and `mask_bbox` using `pdf_xobject_bbox` and `pdf_xobject_matrix`.
* **Potential Leak:** The code then sets `gstate->softmask` to `NULL` and `gstate->softmask_resources` to `NULL`. 
* **Use After Free:** The code then uses `pdf_xobject_matrix` and `pdf_xobject_bbox` again.

The code contains a DoS vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2017-13720. The CWE-ID is CWE-125.
Vulnerability summary:
In the PatternMatch function in fontfile/fontdir.c in libXfont through 1.5.2 and 2.x before 2.0.2, an attacker with access to an X connection can cause a buffer over-read during pattern matching of fonts, leading to information disclosure or a crash (denial of service). This occurs because '\0' characters are incorrectly skipped in situations involving? characters.

The code uses a string manipulation function `reorderSpaces` that rearranges spaces in a string. This function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. 

Here's why:

* **Unbounded Input:** The function takes a string as input, but there's no check to ensure the input string's length is within bounds. 
* **Potential Overwriting:** If the input string is longer than the allocated memory for the string, the function could overwrite memory outside the allocated space. 
* **Exploitable:** This could lead to an attacker overwriting critical data or even executing arbitrary code.
