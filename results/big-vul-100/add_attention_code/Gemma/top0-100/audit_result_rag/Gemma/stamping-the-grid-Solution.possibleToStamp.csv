* **Potential Leak:** The code then sets `gstate->softmask` to `NULL` and `gstate->softmask_resources` to `NULL`.

The code contains a CWE-200 vulnerability. 

The code uses the `xmlParseDocument` function, which is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. 

Here's why:

* **XML External Entities (XXE):**  XXE allows attackers to execute arbitrary code by manipulating XML documents. 
* **Vulnerability:** The code parses XML data from a buffer. If the buffer contains an XML External Entity (XXE) declaration, an attacker can exploit it to access sensitive information or execute arbitrary code. 
* **CWE-200:** This vulnerability is specifically related to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.
