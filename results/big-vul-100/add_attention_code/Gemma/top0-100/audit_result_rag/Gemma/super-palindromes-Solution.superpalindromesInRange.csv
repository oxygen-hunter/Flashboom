Vulnerability summary:
crypto/rsa/rsa_ameth.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1q and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2e allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via an RSA PSS ASN.1 signature that lacks a mask generation function parameter.

The code contains a CWE-200 vulnerability. 

The code uses the `xmlParseMemory` function, which is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. 

Here's why:

* **XML External Entities (XXE):**  XML External Entities allow attackers to inject arbitrary XML code into the parser. This can lead to arbitrary code execution or data manipulation.
* **Vulnerability:** The code parses XML data from a buffer. The `xmlCreateMemoryParserCtxt` function can be exploited to inject malicious XML code. 
* **CVE-ID:** CVE-2013-1824 
* **CWE-ID:** CWE-200

Vulnerability summary:
psi/ztoken.c in Artifex Ghostscript 9.21 mishandles references to the scanner state structure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted PostScript document, related to an out-of-bounds read in the igc_reloc_struct_ptr function in psi/igc.c.
