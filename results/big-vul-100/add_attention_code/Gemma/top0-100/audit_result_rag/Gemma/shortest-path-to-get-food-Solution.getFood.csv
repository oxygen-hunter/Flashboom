Integer overflow in the gs_heap_alloc_bytes function in base/gsmalloc.c in Ghostscript 9.15 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted Postscript (ps) file, as demonstrated by using the ps2pdf command, which triggers an out-of-bounds read or write.

The code contains a CWE-200 (Sensitive Data Exposure) vulnerability. 

Specifically, the code parses a SOAP WSDL file, which could contain an XML External Entity (XXE) declaration. This could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server.

The code contains a CWE-200 vulnerability. 

The code uses the `xmlParseDocument` function, which is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. 

Here's why:

* **XML External Entities (XXE):**  XML External Entities allow attackers to inject arbitrary code into the XML document. 
* **Vulnerability:** The code parses XML data from a buffer. If the buffer contains an XML External Entity (XXE) declaration, the parser will attempt to resolve it, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. 
* **CWE-200:** This vulnerability is specifically related to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.
