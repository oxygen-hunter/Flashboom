* **Buffer Overflow:** If the input string is longer than 5 characters, it could overflow the buffer allocated for the string. 
* **Remote Code Execution:** This vulnerability allows an attacker to write arbitrary code to the memory space of the program.

Vulnerability summary:
Integer overflow in the gs_heap_alloc_bytes function in base/gsmalloc.c in Ghostscript 9.15 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted Postscript (ps) file, as demonstrated by using the ps2pdf command, which triggers an out-of-bounds read or write.
