GNU patch through 2.7.6 is vulnerable to OS shell command injection that can be exploited by opening a crafted patch file that contains an ed style diff payload with shell metacharacters. The ed editor does not need to be present on the vulnerable system. This is different from CVE-2018-1000156. 
",2429,119,7.225329399108887
177857,nan,"YES
The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. 

Here's why:

* **Unbounded String Input:** The code uses `char const *s` and `char const *lim` to represent string boundaries.  
* **Potential Overwriting:**  The code allocates memory using `malloc` and then reads from the file.  If the file size is larger than the allocated memory, the code could overwrite memory outside the allocated space. 
* **CWE-120:** This vulnerability is a classic example of a buffer overflow. 


Let me know if you'd like to explore other potential vulnerabilities.

177859,Exec Code Bypass,"YES

The code contains a potential Exec Code Bypass vulnerability. 

It appears to be based on the CVE-2018-16863 vulnerability, which allows for arbitrary code execution via a specially crafted PostScript document. 
",1044,52,3.201543092727661
177860,Exec Code Bypass,"YES
The code contains a potential Exec Code Bypass vulnerability. 

The code uses the `restore_check_stack` function, which could be vulnerable to a buffer overflow or code execution. 
",1098,42,2.645705461502075
177862,Exec Code,"YES
The code contains a potential use-after-free vulnerability. 

Here's why:

* **The code uses `dev_proc` to get a device pointer.**
* **The code then calls `get_page_device` on the device pointer.**
* **The code then calls `(*dev_proc(dev_old, get_page_device)) (dev_old)` to get a device pointer.**
* **The code then calls `(*dev_proc(dev_new, get_page_device)) (dev_new)` to get a device pointer.**
* **The code then calls `(*dev_proc(dev_old, get_page_device)) (dev_old)` to get a device pointer.**
* **The code then calls `(*dev_proc(dev_new, get_page_device)) (dev_new)` to get a device pointer.**


This means that the code is likely to call `get_page_device` on a device pointer that has already been freed.

The CVE-ID is CVE-2017-13720. The CWE-ID is CWE-125.
Vulnerability summary:
In the PatternMatch function in fontfile/fontdir.c in libXfont through 1.5.2 and 2.x before 2.0.2, an attacker with access to an X connection can cause a buffer over-read during pattern matching of fonts, leading to information disclosure or a crash (denial of service).
