The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. 

The code uses `TT_NEXT_ULONG` to read a potentially large value from memory. If the value is larger than the allocated memory, it could overflow the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.
Vulnerability summary:
Multiple integer overflows in FreeType 2.3.9 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to large values in certain inputs in (1) smooth/ftsmooth.c, (2) sfnt/ttcmap.c, and (3) cff/cffload.c.

The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2019-11360. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.
Vulnerability summary:
A buffer overflow in iptables-restore in netfilter iptables 1.8.2 allows an attacker to (at least) crash the program or potentially gain code execution via a specially crafted iptables-save file. This is related to add_param_to_argv in xshared.c.
