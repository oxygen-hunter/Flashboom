The code contains a potential use-after-free vulnerability. 

Here's why:

* **Memory Management:** The code allocates memory using `new` and `malloc`.
* **Potential Leak:** The code doesn't explicitly deallocate the memory allocated using `new` and `malloc`. 
* **Use-After-Free:** The code might be accessing memory that has already been deallocated.

Vulnerability summary:
In the PatternMatch function in fontfile/fontdir.c in libXfont through 1.5.2 and 2.x before 2.0.2, an attacker with access to an X connection can cause a buffer over-read during pattern matching of fonts, leading to information disclosure or a crash (denial of service). This occurs because '\0' characters are incorrectly skipped in situations involving? characters.
