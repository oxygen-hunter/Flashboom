* **Potential Leak:** The code doesn't explicitly deallocate the memory allocated using `new` or `malloc`.
* **Use-After-Free:** The code might be accessing memory that has been deallocated.

The CVE-ID is CVE-2017-13720. The CWE-ID is CWE-125.
Vulnerability summary:
In the PatternMatch function in fontfile/fontdir.c in libXfont through 1.5.2 and 2.x before 2.0.2, an attacker with access to an X connection can cause a buffer over-read during pattern matching of fonts, leading to information disclosure or a crash (denial of service). This occurs because '\0' characters are incorrectly skipped in situations involving? characters.
