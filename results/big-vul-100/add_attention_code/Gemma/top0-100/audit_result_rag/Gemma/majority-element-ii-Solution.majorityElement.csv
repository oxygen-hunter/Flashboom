Vulnerability summary:
The SOAP parser in PHP before 5.3.22 and 5.4.x before 5.4.12 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a SOAP WSDL file containing an XML external entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference, related to an XML External Entity (XXE) issue in the soap_xmlParseFile and soap_xmlParseMemory functions.

The code contains a CWE-200 vulnerability. 

The code uses the `xmlParseDocument` function, which is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. 

Here's why:

* **XML External Entities (XXE):**  XML External Entities allow attackers to inject arbitrary code into your application. 
* **Vulnerability:** The code parses XML data from a buffer. If the buffer contains an XML External Entity (XXE) declaration, an attacker can control the parsing process. 
* **Impact:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to a complete compromise of the system.
