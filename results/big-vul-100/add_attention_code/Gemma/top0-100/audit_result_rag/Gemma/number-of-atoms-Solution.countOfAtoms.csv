Integer overflow in the gs_heap_alloc_bytes function in base/gsmalloc.c in Ghostscript 9.15 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted Postscript (ps) file, as demonstrated by using the ps2pdf command, which triggers an out-of-bounds read or write.

The code contains a CWE-200 vulnerability. 

The code uses the `xmlParseMemory` function, which is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. 

Here's why:

* **XML External Entities (XXE):**  XML External Entities allow attackers to inject arbitrary XML code into the parser. 
* **Vulnerability:** The code parses XML data from a buffer. If the buffer contains an XML External Entity (XXE) declaration, the parser will attempt to resolve it, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. 
* **CVE-ID:** CVE-2013-1824 
* **CWE-ID:** CWE-200

The code contains a CWE-200 vulnerability. 

The code uses the `xmlParseDocument` function, which is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. 

Here's why:

* **XML External Entities (XXE):**  XML External Entities allow attackers to inject arbitrary code into your application. 
* **Vulnerability:** The code parses XML data from a buffer. If the buffer contains an XML External Entity (XXE) declaration, an attacker can control the parsing process. 
* **Impact:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on your system. 


**Recommendation:**  
* **Sanitize Input:**  Always sanitize user-provided input before parsing XML data. 
* **Limit XML Parsing:**  Avoid parsing XML data from untrusted sources. 
* **Use a Secure XML Parser:**  Consider using a secure XML parser that mitigates XXE vulnerabilities.
