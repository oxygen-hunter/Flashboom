* **Unbounded String Input:** The code uses `char const *s` and `char const *lim` to represent string boundaries.  
* **Potential Overwriting:**  The code allocates memory using `malloc` and then reads from the file.  If the file size is larger than the allocated memory, the code could overwrite memory outside the allocated space. 
* **CWE-120:** This vulnerability is a classic example of a buffer overflow.
