The code reads data from a floppy disk controller. The code reads data from the controller's FIFO buffer. The FIFO buffer is a circular buffer, and the code reads data from the buffer at a specific position. The code then writes data to the buffer at the same position. 

The code does not check the length of the data being read or written. If the data being read or written is longer than the buffer, the code will write data to the buffer beyond the buffer's bounds. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

177923,Bypass,"YES
The code uses the `VCWD_RENAME` function, which truncates the path upon encountering a null character. This allows for a remote attacker to bypass intended extension restrictions and create files with unexpected names via a crafted second argument. 
","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-2348. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.
Vulnerability summary:
The move_uploaded_file implementation in ext/standard/basic_functions.c in PHP before 5.4.39, 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 truncates a pathname upon encountering a \x00 character, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended extension restrictions and create files with unexpected names via a crafted second argument.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-7243.

The code contains an integer overflow vulnerability.

Vulnerability summary:
Integer overflow in the gst_vorbis_tag_add_coverart function (gst-libs/gst/tag/gstvorbistag.c) in vorbistag in gst-plugins-base (aka gstreamer-plugins-base) allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted COVERART tag that is converted from a base64 representation, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow. 
","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0586. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.
Vulnerability summary:
Integer overflow in the gst_vorbis_tag_add_coverart function (gst-libs/gst/tag/gstvorbistag.c) in vorbistag in gst-plugins-base (aka gstreamer-plugins-base) before 0.10.23 in GStreamer allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted COVERART tag that is converted from a base64 representation, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.

","The code contains a nan vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2017-11144. The CWE-ID is CWE-754.
Vulnerability summary:
In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, the openssl extension PEM sealing code did not check the return value of the OpenSSL sealing function, which could lead to a crash of the PHP interpreter, related to an interpretation conflict for a negative number in ext/openssl/openssl.c, and an OpenSSL documentation omission.
