177922,Exec Code Overflow,"YES
The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. 
It uses the `add_argv` function, which is vulnerable to buffer overflow. 
The code does not properly check the length of the input string before copying it to the buffer. 
This can lead to an overflow of the buffer, which can then be exploited to overwrite memory in other parts of the program. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2019-11360. The CWE-ID is CWE-119. 
","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2019-11360. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.
Vulnerability summary:
A buffer overflow in iptables-restore in netfilter iptables 1.8.2 allows an attacker to (at least) crash the program or potentially gain code execution via a specially crafted iptables-save file. This is related to add_param_to_argv in xshared.c.

Vulnerability summary:
The move_uploaded_file implementation in ext/standard/basic_functions.c in PHP before 5.4.39, 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 truncates a pathname upon encountering a \x00 character, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended extension restrictions and create files with unexpected names via a crafted second argument.
