NO.

The function `gnutls_session_get_data` is not vulnerable to the same issue as in the original code, because it has proper bounds checking before the `memcpy` operation. The `psession.size` value is checked against `*session_data_size` and the copy operation is performed only when `psession.size` is less than or equal to `*session_data_size`. This prevents a buffer overflow condition.

However, the provided `getGoodIndices` function in the second code snippet has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `addmod` lambda function. The input parameters `a`, `b`, and `mod` are of type `uint32_t`, and the function uses modulo arithmetic to avoid overflow. However, the check `mod - a <= b` may not correctly detect an integer overflow when `a + b` exceeds the maximum value of `uint32_t`. This can lead to an integer overflow, causing incorrect results or buffer miscalculations.

To fix this issue, you can use a safer approach by using `std::numeric_limits<uint32_t>::max()` to check for integer overflow:

The function sum\_update() you provided does not contain the bypass vulnerability CVE-2017-15994 (CWE-354) as it is not related to access restrictions. However, I would like to address some potential issues in the provided getGoodIndices() function:

1. Integer Overflow/Underflow (CWE-190, CWE-191): In the lambda function 'addmod', the calculation of 'b -= mod' can result in an integer underflow if 'b' is already less than'mod'. Similarly, in the lambda function'mulmod', the calculation of 'a * b' can result in an integer overflow if 'a' and 'b' are large enough.

2. Performance: The 'powmod' lambda function calculates powers using repeated multiplication, which can be inefficient for large exponents. It would be more efficient to use a method like binary exponentiation to calculate the power.

However, the `getGoodIndices` function has an integer overflow vulnerability. In the `addmod` and `mulmod` functions, the check `if (mod - a <= b)` is used to determine if an unsigned integer overflow has occurred.

In this case, `mod - a` will wrap around to a large positive number, and `b` will be less than that large positive number, causing the condition `mod - a <= b` to be true, even though an integer overflow has occurred.

NO, the second code snippet is not vulnerable to the Exec Code Bypass vulnerability. The code is different from the first one and does not contain any function that could be used for arbitrary shell command execution.

The function `Splash::scaleMaskYuXd` does not contain any of the vulnerabilities listed in the audit guidelines. It is a function that scales an image and does not have any security vulnerabilities based on the provided code.

However, the function `getGoodIndices` has some potential issues related to integer overflows in the helper lambdas `addmod`, `mulmod`, and `powmod`. These functions use unsigned integers and rely on the wrapping behavior of unsigned integers to achieve the desired functionality. While this behavior is well-defined in C++, it can lead to confusion and potential bugs if not used carefully.

For example, in the `addmod` function, the expression `mod - a <= b` can lead to an integer overflow if `a` and `b` are large enough. Similarly, in the `powmod` function, the expression `b >>= 1` can cause an integer overflow if `b` is the maximum value for a `uint32_t` and has a 1-bit set.

To avoid these potential issues, you can use signed integers and check for integer overflows explicitly. Alternatively, you can use a library that provides modular arithmetic operations to ensure that the operations are performed correctly and securely.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The provided code does not contain the nan vulnerability mentioned in the CVE-2017-11144. The code checks the return value of the OpenSSL sealing function and handles failures by freeing resources and returning FALSE. The PHP_OPENSSL_CHECK_SIZE_T_TO_INT macro is used to ensure data_len is within the range of an integer, which prevents potential buffer overflows. The code also initializes and cleans up resources properly, and it validates the parameters passed to the function.","The code contains a nan vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2017-11144. The CWE-ID is CWE-754.
Vulnerability summary:
In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, the openssl extension PEM sealing code did not check the return value of the OpenSSL sealing function, which could lead to a crash of the PHP interpreter, related to an interpretation conflict for a negative number in ext/openssl/openssl.c, and an OpenSSL documentation omission.
