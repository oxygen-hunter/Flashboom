However, the sampleStats function has a potential integer overflow in the'mi' and'ma' calculations. If 'count' has a large number of elements, the subtraction in the calculation of'mi' and'ma' could result in an integer overflow. To fix this, you can use'size_t' instead of 'int' for the'mi' and'ma' variables and ensure that intermediate values are also of the same type.

```cpp
size_t mi = distance(count.cbegin(), find_if(count.cbegin(), count.cend(), 
                                   [](int x) { return x!= 0; }));
