NO, the provided `sum_update` function is not vulnerable to the same issue as described in CVE-2017-15994. The vulnerability in the original code was related to the improper handling of archaic checksums, which is not reflected in this function.

However, I would like to point out that the `isGoodArray` function has a potential issue. It does not check for the size of the input vector. If the vector is empty, the function will cause undefined behavior by accessing the first element (`nums[0]`). To fix this, you should add a check for an empty vector:

```c++
bool isGoodArray(const vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.empty()) {
        return false;
    }

    // Bézout's identity
    int result = nums[0];

The vulnerable code is related to LDAP server crafted packet handling and database value reading, while the provided code is about character encoding conversion.

However, I would like to point out that the given code still has a bug. In the `next_codepoint_handle_ext` function, the `ilen` variable is assigned the value of `strnlen(str, 5)`, which limits the string length check to 5 bytes. If the string is longer than 5 bytes and contains a multi-byte character that starts at the 5th byte, the function will not process it correctly. The code should use `strnlen(str, <actual string length>)` or `strlen(str)` instead.

The function Splash::blitMask() provided in the second code snippet is the same as the one in the first snippet, except for the addition of the SplashClipResult clipRes parameter in the function signature. Since the vulnerability in the first code snippet is not related to this parameter, the second code snippet is not vulnerable either.

However, I would like to point out that the code could potentially have a NULL pointer dereference if the SplashBitmap object (src) has a width or height of zero. In the code, 'w' and 'h' are assigned the values of src->getWidth() and src->getHeight() respectively. If these functions return zero, then 'p = src->getDataPtr();' will result in a NULL pointer dereference in the for loop. To avoid this, you should check if 'w' and 'h' are greater than zero before processing the data pointer.
