YES, the code is vulnerable to the same issue as described in CVE-2015-5252 and CWE-264. The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of share names with certain substring relationships, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended file-access restrictions via a symlink that points outside of a share.

The provided code snippet is part of the Samba `check_reduced_name_with_privilege` function, which is responsible for checking the validity of a file path based on the share name and the parent directory. However, the code does not properly handle cases where the parent directory is a symlink pointing outside of the share. This can lead to unintended access, as the function may not detect that the parent directory is outside the share.

The second code snippet also has a different function signature and does not contain the same vulnerability.

However, I would like to point out that the second code snippet has a potential issue with the 'to_minute' lambda function. If the's' vector contains an invalid string that cannot be converted to an integer, the'stoi' function will throw an 'invalid_argument' exception. It is essential to handle this exception or validate the input before passing it to the'stoi' function to avoid any undefined behavior or crashes.

Here is the revised version of the 'to_minute' lambda function:

const auto& to_minute = [](const auto& s) -> int {
try {
return stoi(s.substr(0, 2)) * 60 + stoi(s.substr(2));
} catch (const std::invalid_argument&) {
// Handle invalid input or throw an exception
return -1;
