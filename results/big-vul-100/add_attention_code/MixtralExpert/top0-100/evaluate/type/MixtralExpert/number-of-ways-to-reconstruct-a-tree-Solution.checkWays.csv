NO, the provided code is not vulnerable to the same issue as the original code. The reason is that in this version of the function, there is only one allocation for the `control` variable, which is done with the `talloc` function. This function takes care of memory management and returns an error if there is not enough memory to allocate. Therefore, there is no vulnerability related to memory consumption and daemon crash via crafted packets in this version of the function.

However, it is important to note that the `talloc_realloc` function is used to resize the `r` array, but it is not clear if there is a limit to the size of this array. If the array can grow indefinitely, it could lead to a denial of service due to resource exhaustion. It is recommended to add a check to ensure that the array does not grow beyond a certain limit.

The function dns_read_name() is vulnerable to the nan (name compression attack) vulnerability as described in CVE-2018-20103 and CWE-835. The vulnerability is due to the recursive call in the case of a compressed pointer:

This code only calculates the checksum using MD5 or MD4 algorithms and does not have the bypass vulnerability.

However, I would like to point out that the function has a potential memory leak. In the case of CSUM_MD4, CSUM_MD4_OLD, and CSUM_MD4_BUSTED, the code allocates memory using `new_array` but does not release it using `free` before the function returns. This can lead to a memory leak if this function is called frequently.

To fix this, you should add a `free(buf1)` before the end of the function, like this:

case CSUM_MD4_BUSTED: {
    //...

NO, the provided Splash::makeDashedPath function is not vulnerable to the CVE-2013-1788 vulnerability or CWE-119 (DoS Exec Code Overflow). The function does not contain any memory allocation or deallocation operations, and it does not perform any arithmetic operations that could lead to an overflow or underflow.
