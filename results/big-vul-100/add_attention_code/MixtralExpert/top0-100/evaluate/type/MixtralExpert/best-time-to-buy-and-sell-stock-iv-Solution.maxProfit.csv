The provided C++ code is not vulnerable to the same Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability as the original code. The main reason is that the `ldap_push_filter` function in this code does not allocate memory based on user input, unlike the original code. In this code, the function processes a pre-defined data structure (`struct ldb_parse_tree`) and its sub-fields, which are not based on user input.
