177773,DoS Exec Code Overflow Mem. Corr.," NO, the second code is not vulnerable to the mentioned vulnerability type (DoS Exec Code Overflow Mem. Corr.). The first code is vulnerable because it uses unvalidated user inputs in arithmetic operations without proper bounds checking, which can lead to an integer overflow/underflow vulnerability (CWE-190, CWE-191). The second code does not perform any arithmetic operations with user inputs, so it is not vulnerable.

However, I would like to point out a potential issue in the second code. In the following lines:

```c++
for (int i = 0; i < N - M + 1; ++i) {
   ...
    for (int j = 0; j < M; ++j) {
        if (stamp[j] == target[i + j]) {

        } else {
            todo.emplace(i + j);
        }
    }
   ...
}
```

If the `target` string does not have enough characters to compare with the `stamp` string, the code will access the `target` string out of bounds, causing undefined behavior. To fix this, you should add a check before the inner loop to ensure that `i + j` is within the bounds of the `target` string. For example:

177922,Exec Code Overflow," Answer: YES

The function add_param_to_argv is vulnerable to buffer overflow (CWE-119). The code uses a fixed size buffer param_buffer with a size of 1024, but it does not check if the number of characters copied into the buffer exceeds its size. This can lead to writing past the allocated memory space, causing undefined behavior, which can be exploited by an attacker to crash the program or potentially execute arbitrary code (Exec Code Overflow).

The vulnerable line is:

param_buffer[param_len++] = *curchar;

This line is within the switch statement and is executed for all cases, without checking if the buffer has enough space to store the next character. This can result in a buffer overflow if the input string is longer than 1023 characters.

The given CVE-ID CVE-2019-11360 and CWE-ID CWE-119 are correct for this vulnerability.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
