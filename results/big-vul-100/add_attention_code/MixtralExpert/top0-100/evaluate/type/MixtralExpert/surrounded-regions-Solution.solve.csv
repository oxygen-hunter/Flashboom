The provided code for `add_param_to_argv` function is the same as the vulnerable code you've shown, but the second code snippet you've given is completely unrelated and has no vulnerabilities related to buffer overflow or exec code overflow.

However, the vulnerability in the `add_param_to_argv` function is due to insufficient bounds checking when copying characters to `param_buffer`. The buffer size is 1024, but there is no check to limit the number of characters copied, which can lead to a buffer overflow.
