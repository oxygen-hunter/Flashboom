NO, the provided code is not vulnerable to the mentioned DoS Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The code snippet is the same as the previous one, but the vulnerable part is not presented here. The vulnerability is related to the handling of crafted PDF files, which is not shown in the provided code.

However, the provided code snippet does have a potential integer overflow in the lines:

n = 1 << colorMap->getBits();
imgData.lookup = (SplashColorPtr<SplashColor>)gmalloc(n);

If the value of colorMap->getBits() is large enough, it can cause an integer overflow in the 'n' variable, leading to a smaller allocation than expected. This can potentially lead to a buffer overflow if more data is written to the 'imgData.lookup' buffer than it can handle. To fix this, you can use a long long type for the 'n' variable or limit the number of bits to the maximum supported by the SplashColorPtr type.

For example:

long long n = 1LL << colorMap->getBits();
imgData.lookup = (SplashColorPtr<SplashColor>)gmalloc(n);
