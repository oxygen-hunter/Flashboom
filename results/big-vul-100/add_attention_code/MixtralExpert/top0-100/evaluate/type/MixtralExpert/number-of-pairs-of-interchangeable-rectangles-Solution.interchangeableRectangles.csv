The code snippet you provided is different from the one associated with CVE-2013-6051. The new code snippet does not contain the uninitialized variable total, so it is not vulnerable to the described denial of service attack.

However, I would like to point out that the code you provided at the end of your message, interchangeableRectangles, has a potential integer overflow issue. In the function, the expression `static_cast<int64_t>(c) * (c - 1) / 2` might cause an integer overflow if `c` is equal to `INT_MAX`.

The previous code had a problem with not checking for overflow when calculating the number of bytes to read for the pixels array. This code does not have that issue because it calculates the number of pixels to read (n) correctly using multiplication of width and height, and then it reads each pixel one by one in a loop, which does not have an overflow vulnerability.

However, I would like to point out that the code you provided after the original vulnerable code, `interchangeableRectangles` function, has a potential integer overflow vulnerability. In the function, the variable `result` is an `int64_t`, but the calculation `c * (c - 1) / 2` is performed using `int` type, which could lead to an integer overflow if `c` is large enough. To fix this, you can cast `c` to `int64_t` before performing the calculation. Here's the corrected code:
```c++
result += static_cast<int64_t>(c) * (static_cast<int64_t>(c) - 1) / 2;
