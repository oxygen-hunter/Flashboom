NO, the provided code is not vulnerable to the Exec Code Overflow vulnerability (CVE-2009-0946, CWE-189) you described. The code snippet is different from the one that has the vulnerability. However, I will point out some potential issues in the code unrelated to the CVE-2009-0946:

1. In the `switch` statement, the `case 0` is not handled properly. If `charset->format` is not 0, it will fall through to the `default` case, which sets the error flag. However, if `charset->format` is 1 or any other value, the code inside the `case 0` block will execute without checking the error flag. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

2. The variable `i` is declared and used in the `case 0` block, but it is not declared before use. It should be declared as `FT_UInt i = 1;` before the `for` loop.

3. The `nleft` variable is used without being initialized in the `case 0` block. It should be initialized before being used in the `for` loop condition.

4. The `cff_charset_load` function does not return or propagate the error flag.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
