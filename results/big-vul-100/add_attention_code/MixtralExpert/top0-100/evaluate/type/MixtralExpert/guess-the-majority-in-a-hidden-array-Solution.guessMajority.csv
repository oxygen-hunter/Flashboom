NO, the given dns_read_name function is not vulnerable to the nan vulnerability mentioned in the CVE-2018-20103 and CWE-835. The vulnerability in the original code was due to the lack of a termination condition when handling compressed pointers, allowing for infinite recursion or stack exhaustion.

2. The code does not check for integer overflow when incrementing nb_bytes.
3. The code does not validate the input parameters.

To mitigate these issues, you can:
