However, it is essential to review the entire codebase, including the `SplashImageMaskSource` function, as the vulnerability might be in the code not provided here.

That being said, the provided code does have some issues that should be addressed:

1. Memory allocation: The code uses `gmalloc` and `gfree` for memory management, which might not be standard C++ functions. Make sure that these functions are part of a well-maintained library and that they handle memory allocation correctly.

2. Integer division: In the following line, there is an integer division that might not produce the desired result:

   yp = scaledHeight / srcHeight;

   If `scaledHeight` and `srcHeight` are not guaranteed to be greater than zero, or if they are unsigned integers, the result might not be what you expect. Consider using:

   yp = scaledHeight > 0? scaledHeight / srcHeight : 0;

177922,Exec Code Overflow," Answer: YES

The function `add_param_to_argv` is vulnerable to a buffer overflow (CWE-119, CWE-120). The code uses the `param_buffer` array to store the parsed parameters, but it does not properly check if the total length of the parameter string exceeds the size of the buffer (1024 bytes). This can lead to writing past the allocated memory space, causing undefined behavior, which can be exploited by an attacker to crash the program or potentially execute arbitrary code (CVE-2019-11360).

The following lines of code are responsible for the vulnerability:

```cpp
char param_buffer[1024], *curchar;
...
param_buffer[param_len++] = *curchar;
...
if (param_len >= sizeof(param_buffer))
	xtables_error(PARAMETER_PROBLEM,
		      ""Parameter too long!"");
```

The code checks if `param_len` is equal to or greater than the size of `param_buffer` after each character is added, but this check should be performed before adding the character to the buffer. This way, the function can avoid writing past the buffer's allocated memory space.

A safer implementation would be:
