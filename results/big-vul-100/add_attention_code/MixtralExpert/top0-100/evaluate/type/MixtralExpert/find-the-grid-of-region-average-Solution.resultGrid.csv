The function SplashFTFont::makeGlyph() appears to be safe from the DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability mentioned in CVE-2009-3605 and CWE-189. The function does not perform any arithmetic operations with user-provided input that could lead to an integer overflow or underflow. The function uses the gid variable for array indexing, but gid is either obtained from the codeToGID array or directly from the user input after checking if it's less than ff->codeToGIDLen. Therefore, the function should not be vulnerable to the mentioned vulnerability.

However, I cannot analyze the rest of the codebase, so there could be vulnerabilities in other functions or parts of the code.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

NO.

The provided C++ code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow (CVE-2019-11360, CWE-119) as it does not contain any function that is directly manipulating arrays or buffers without proper bounds checking. Instead, it uses `std::string`, `std::vector`, and other STL containers, which automatically handle memory management and provide safety guarantees against buffer overflows.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177923,Bypass," NO.

The provided C++ code is not vulnerable to the same issue as the previous PHP code. The first code sample was vulnerable because it used strncpy to copy a filename from user input, which can be manipulated to include null bytes and bypass the filename extension check. The second code sample does not perform any filename extension checks, so the issue of bypassing them does not apply.

However, the second code sample still has some issues that should be addressed:

1. Memory leaks: In the case of an error during the move_uploaded_file operation, the allocated memory for the paths is not freed.
2. Insecure function usage: The code uses strncpy, which is not inherently insecure, but it is essential to use it correctly. In this case, the size parameter should be the actual buffer size, not the length of the source string plus one.

To fix these issues, you should:

1. Free the allocated memory for paths in the error handling section.
2. Update the strncpy call to use the correct buffer size.

Here's an example of how to fix these issues:

```cpp
if (zend_parse_parameters(ZEND_NUM_ARGS() TSRMLS_CC, ""ss"", &path, path_len, &new_path, new_path_len) == FAILURE","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.
