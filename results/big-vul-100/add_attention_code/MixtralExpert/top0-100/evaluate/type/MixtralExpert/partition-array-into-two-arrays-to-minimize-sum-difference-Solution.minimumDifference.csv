Therefore, the refactored code is not vulnerable to the same DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability (CVE-2013-1788, CWE-119) as the original code.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177922,Exec Code Overflow," Answer: YES

The function `add_param_to_argv` is vulnerable to a buffer overflow (CWE-119). The code uses a fixed-size buffer `param_buffer` of 1024 characters to store the parameter string. However, there is no bound checking when copying characters to this buffer in the loop:

```cpp
while (*curchar) {
    param_buffer[param_len++] = *curchar;
   ...
}
```

If the input string is larger than 1023 characters, it will result in a buffer overflow, which can lead to arbitrary code execution (Exec Code Overflow, CVE-2019-11360) or program crashes. To fix this vulnerability, you should use a dynamic memory allocation technique or limit the number of characters copied into the buffer based on its size.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
