The function add\_param\_to\_argv is vulnerable to a buffer overflow (CWE-119). The code uses a fixed-size buffer (param\_buffer) of 1024 characters to store the parameter string, but it does not properly check the input length before copying it into the buffer. This can lead to writing past the allocated memory space, causing undefined behavior, including potential code execution (CVE-2019-11360).

The problematic line is:

This line is within the default case of the switch statement, which copies characters one by one into the param\_buffer without checking if there's enough space left.
