} else {

The function `add_param_to_argv` is vulnerable to a buffer overflow (CWE-119). The code uses a fixed-size buffer `param_buffer` of 1024 characters to store the parsed parameters. However, there is no bound checking when copying characters to this buffer in the loop:

```c++
while (*curchar) {
    param_buffer[param_len++] = *curchar;
   ...
}
```

If the input data contains more than 1023 characters, it will result in a buffer overflow, which can lead to arbitrary code execution (Exec Code Overflow, CVE-2019-11360) or a program crash.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
