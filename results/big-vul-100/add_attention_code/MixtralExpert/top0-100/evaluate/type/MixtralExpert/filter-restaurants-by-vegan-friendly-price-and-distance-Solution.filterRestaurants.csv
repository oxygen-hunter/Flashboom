However, I would like to point out that the `filterRestaurants` function has a potential issue related to unbounded vector resizing (CWE-188). The `result` vector uses `emplace_back` to add elements, which can cause the vector to resize if it runs out of capacity. If the vector needs to resize, it may trigger memory reallocations, which can be expensive and potentially cause performance issues. While this is not a security vulnerability, it can still lead to unintended consequences.

To mitigate this, consider reserving space for the `result` vector upfront if the final size is known or can be estimated. You can use the `resize` or `reserve` function to preallocate memory for the vector.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.
