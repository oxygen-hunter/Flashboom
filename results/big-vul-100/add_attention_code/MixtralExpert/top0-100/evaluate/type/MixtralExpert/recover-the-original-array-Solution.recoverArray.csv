The function _XcursorReadImage() provided in the second code snippet does not contain any vulnerabilities related to Overflow (CWE-190) based on the given code. The potential vulnerability in the first code snippet is due to the missing bounds checking when reading the width and height of the image, which is not present in the second code snippet.

However, there is a missing initialization of the `image` pointer, which could lead to a use-after-free vulnerability if the function is called with an uninitialized `image` pointer. To fix this, you should initialize the `image` pointer before using it:

```c++
XcursorImage *image = new XcursorImage();

The function do\_ed\_script() does not seem to contain any vulnerabilities related to the issues listed in your audit steps. It is a function that writes a temporary file and executes an editor program on that file. The function does not perform any operations that involve user input validation, memory management, or error handling, which are the main areas of concern in your audit.

However, the function does call an external function sprintf(), which can be vulnerable to format string attacks if the format string is not properly validated. But in this case, the format string is a hardcoded string literal, so there is no risk of a format string attack.

However, the `recoverArray` function provided in the second part of your question has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability (CWE-120). In the `check` lambda function, the `cnt` map is passed by value, not by reference. This means that if the `check` function modifies `cnt`, it will not affect the original `cnt` variable used in the `recoverArray` function. If the size of `nums` is large, this could lead to a buffer overflow in the `cnt` map when the `check` function attempts to access an index outside its allocated memory.

To fix this vulnerability, change the `cnt` parameter in the `check` lambda function to be passed by reference:

`auto check = [&nums,&cnt](int k, vector<int> *result) {... };`

This will ensure that any modifications to `cnt` inside the `check` function will be reflected in the original `cnt` variable used in the `recoverArray` function.","The code contains a Exec_Code vulnerability.
