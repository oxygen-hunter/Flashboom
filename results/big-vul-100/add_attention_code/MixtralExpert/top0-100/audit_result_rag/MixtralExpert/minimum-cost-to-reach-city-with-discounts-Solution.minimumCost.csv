The function `bool extractPages(const char *srcFileName, const char *destFileName)` does not contain any of the vulnerabilities mentioned in the audit steps. It is a function that extracts pages from a PDF file and saves them with a specified pattern, so it mainly deals with input/output operations and does not contain any risky operations such as dynamic memory management, pointer arithmetic, or user input validation.

The `minimumCost` function, on the other hand, has some potential issues that should be addressed:

1. In the `adj` map, the key is an `int`, but the value is a `vector<P>` where `P` is a `pair<int, int>`. This could lead to a potential integer overflow if the number of edges in the graph is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in an `int`.
2. The `best` map uses an `int` as the key for the outer map and another `int` as the key for the inner map. If the graph is large, this could lead to a large amount of memory usage. It would be more efficient to use an `unordered_set` to store the visited nodes instead of an `unordered_map`.
