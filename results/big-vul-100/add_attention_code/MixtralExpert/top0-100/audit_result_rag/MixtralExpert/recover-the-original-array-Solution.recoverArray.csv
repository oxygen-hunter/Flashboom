However, the `recoverArray` function provided in the second part of your question has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability (CWE-120). In the `check` lambda function, the `cnt` map is passed by value, not by reference. This means that if the `check` function modifies `cnt`, it will not affect the original `cnt` variable used in the `recoverArray` function. If the size of `nums` is large, this could lead to a buffer overflow in the `cnt` map when the `check` function attempts to access an index outside its allocated memory.

To fix this vulnerability, change the `cnt` parameter in the `check` lambda function to be passed by reference:
