1. The `image` pointer is not initialized before being dereferenced in the `if (chunkHeader.version < image->version)` line. This will likely cause a compilation error, but if it doesn't, it will lead to undefined behavior.

2. The `XcursorImageDestroy` function is called when the function returns `NULL`, but it is not called when the function returns a valid `XcursorImage` pointer. This could lead to memory leaks.

The first code snippet was vulnerable because it used xmlCreateMemoryParserCtxt, which could be exploited if the input buffer contained malicious XML data. The second code snippet does not have any XML parsing or processing, so it is not vulnerable to the same issue.

To ensure the security of XML parsing and processing, you should:

1. Disable DTD loading and external entities.

The function `add_param_to_argv` is vulnerable to a buffer overflow (CWE-119). The code uses a fixed-size buffer `param_buffer` of 1024 characters to store the parsed parameters. However, there is no bound checking when copying characters to this buffer in the loop:

```c++
