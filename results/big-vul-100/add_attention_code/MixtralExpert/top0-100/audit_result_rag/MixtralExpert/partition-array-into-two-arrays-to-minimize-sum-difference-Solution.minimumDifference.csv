NO, the provided `drawImage` function is not vulnerable to the mentioned DoS Exec Code Overflow vulnerability (CVE-2009-3605, CWE-189). The vulnerability in the original code was due to multiple integer overflows in different files, which are not present in this function.

However, there are some issues in the given code that should be addressed:

1. Memory Leak (CWE-401): In the case where `image` is `NULL`, the code deletes `imgStr` and returns. However, there is a memory leak because the memory allocated for `buffer` is not freed.
