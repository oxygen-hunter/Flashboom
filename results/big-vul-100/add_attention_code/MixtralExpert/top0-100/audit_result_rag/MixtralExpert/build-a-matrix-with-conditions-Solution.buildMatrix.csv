However, the code snippet does have memory management issues that need to be addressed:

1. Memory leaks: In case of failure, the code allocates memory for `new_hook_print` but does not free it, leading to a memory leak.

2. Null pointer dereference: In the `HOOK_CONNECT` callback, if `ptr_hook` is null, the code will dereference it, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability.
