The function `add_param_to_argv` is vulnerable to a buffer overflow (CWE-119). The code uses a fixed-size buffer `param_buffer` of 1024 characters to store the parameter string. However, there is no bound checking when copying characters from `curchar` to `param_buffer`. If the input string contains more than 1023 characters, it will result in a buffer overflow, leading to undefined behavior, including potential code execution (CVE-2019-11360).
