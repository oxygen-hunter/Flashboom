The function dns\_read\_name() is vulnerable to the nan (name at nowhere) vulnerability as described in CVE-2018-20103 and CWE-835. The vulnerability is due to the recursive call in the case of a compressed pointer, where the pointer can be made to point to itself or a long chain of valid pointers, causing infinite recursion and stack exhaustion.

In the given code, the check for the pointer comparison is performed as (buffer + reader[1]) > reader, which does not prevent the pointer from pointing to itself or creating a long chain of valid pointers.

While these functions are not insecure per se, the function can potentially cause performance issues or even a Denial of Service (DoS) if the input `formula` string is very large or contains a large number of matches for the regular expression. This is because the function creates a new `map` and `string` object for each match, which can lead to excessive memory allocation and deallocation.
