The function `asn1_time_to_time_t` deals with time parsing but not certificate parsing.

However, the code still has some potential issues that should be addressed:

1. Input validation: The code does not validate the input `timestr`. It is assumed to be of a certain length, but there is no check for this. It is a good practice to validate inputs before processing them.

2. Memory management: The code uses `estrdup` to duplicate the input string, but there is no check if the memory allocation was successful. It is a good practice to check if the memory allocation was successful before using the allocated memory.

3. Code readability: The code is difficult to read due to the lack of comments and inconsistent indentation. It is a good practice to make the code more readable by adding comments and consistent indentation.

4. Integer overflow: The code uses `static_cast<int64_t>` to avoid integer overflow, but it is still a good practice to validate the inputs and ensure that the calculation does not result in an overflow.
