It only uses BN_mod_exp and BN_mod_exp_mont_consttime functions, which are not vulnerable in this context.

However, there are some issues in the code that should be addressed:

1. Memory leaks: The code does not free the memory allocated for 'e' in the second loop.
2. Integer overflow: In the expression '20 + i * 5', if 'i' is large enough, it can cause an integer overflow, leading to unexpected results.
3. Unchecked user input: The 'num2' variable is not checked for validity before being used in the for loop conditions.

To fix these issues, you should:

1. Free the memory allocated for 'e' in the second loop.
2. Validate the 'num2' variable and check for integer overflow in the expression '20 + i * 5'.
