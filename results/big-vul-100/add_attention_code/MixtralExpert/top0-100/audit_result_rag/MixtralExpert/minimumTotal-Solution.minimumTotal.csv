```cpp
if (!EVP_SealInit(ctx, cipher, eks, eksl, &iv_buf[0], pkeys, nkeys) ||
   !EVP_SealUpdate(ctx, buf, &len1, (unsigned char *)data, (int)data_len) ||
   !EVP_SealFinal(ctx, buf + len1, &len2)) {
    RETVAL_FALSE;
    efree(buf); // This line is not reachable if any of the above functions fail
    EVP_CIPHER_CTX_free(ctx);
    goto clean_exit;
}
```

To fix this, move the `efree(buf)`",3685,301,29.075202703475952
