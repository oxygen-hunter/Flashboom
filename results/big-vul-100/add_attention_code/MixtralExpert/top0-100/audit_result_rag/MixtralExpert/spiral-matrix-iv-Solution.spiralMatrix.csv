YES, the code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `ITEM_XNAME_FOLLOWS` flag in the `if` condition. The code does not validate or sanitize the input received in the `vstring` when the `ITEM_XNAME_FOLLOWS` flag is set. This can lead to bypassing intended access restrictions, similar to the CVE-2017-17434 vulnerability you mentioned.

The issue is that the code does not check if the input received in the `vstring` is within the allowed bounds or if it contains any malicious content. An attacker can exploit this by sending specially crafted input to bypass access restrictions and access unauthorized files or data.",3192,169,16.047051429748535

The function dns_read_name() does not properly check for infinite recursion when handling compressed pointers. If a crafted packet creates a long chain of valid pointers or makes the pointer point to itself, it can result in stack exhaustion due to infinite recursion.

The vulnerability is in the following part of the code:

```c++
