177773,DoS Exec Code Overflow Mem. Corr.," NO, the second code is not vulnerable to the mentioned vulnerability type (DoS Exec Code Overflow Mem. Corr.). The first code is vulnerable because it uses unvalidated user inputs in arithmetic operations without proper bounds checking, which can lead to an integer overflow/underflow vulnerability (CWE-190, CWE-191). The second code does not perform any arithmetic operations with user inputs, so it is not vulnerable.

However, I would like to point out a potential issue in the second code. In the following lines:

```c++
for (int i = 0; i < N - M + 1; ++i) {

        }
    }

If the `target` string does not have enough characters to compare with the `stamp` string, the code will access the `target` string out of bounds, causing undefined behavior. To fix this, you should add a check before the inner loop to ensure that `i + j` is within the bounds of the `target` string. For example:
