The provided C++ code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow (CVE-2019-11360, CWE-119) as it does not contain any function that is directly manipulating arrays or buffers without proper bounds checking.

177923,Bypass," NO.

The provided C++ code is not vulnerable to the same issue as the previous PHP code. The first code sample was vulnerable because it used strncpy to copy a filename from user input, which can be manipulated to include null bytes and bypass the filename extension check. The second code sample does not perform any filename extension checks, so the issue of bypassing them does not apply.

However, the second code sample still has some issues that should be addressed:

1. Memory leaks: In the case of an error during the move_uploaded_file operation, the allocated memory for the paths is not freed.
2. Insecure function usage: The code uses strncpy, which is not inherently insecure, but it is essential to use it correctly. In this case, the size parameter should be the actual buffer size, not the length of the source string plus one.

To fix these issues, you should:

1. Free the allocated memory for paths in the error handling section.
2. Update the strncpy call to use the correct buffer size.

Here's an example of how to fix these issues:
