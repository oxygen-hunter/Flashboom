However, it does contain integer calculations and memory allocation, which could potentially lead to integer overflows or memory leaks.

To determine if the code is vulnerable, we need to analyze the specific integer calculations and memory allocation operations. Based on the provided code snippet, it appears that the integer calculations are performed within a switch statement based on the mode variable. The mode variable is assigned a value based on user input, but the code snippet does not show the user input validation or sanitation process.
