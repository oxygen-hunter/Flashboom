The `maximumValueSum` function appears to be implementing a 3-sum problem solution.

For instance, it does not check if the memory allocation for the `min_heaps` vector is successful. If the memory allocation fails, the function may continue executing, leading to undefined behavior.

To mitigate this risk, you should always check if memory allocation is successful before proceeding with further processing. In this case, you can add a check after the `min_heaps.resize()` statement to ensure that the memory allocation was successful. If it fails, you can return an error code or throw an exception.

Here's an example of how you can modify the code to check for memory allocation errors:

min_heaps.resize(min_heaps.size() + size(board[0]));
