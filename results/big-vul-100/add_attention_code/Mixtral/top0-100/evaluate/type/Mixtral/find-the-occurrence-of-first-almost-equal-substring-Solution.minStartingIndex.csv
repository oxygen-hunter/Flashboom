177840,+Info," The given `ldb_dn_escape_internal` function is not directly related to the `minStartingIndex` function. Therefore, the vulnerability assessment should be focused on the `ldb_dn_escape_internal` function.

Based on the provided code, the `ldb_dn_escape_internal` function appears to be vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The vulnerability arises from the `memcpy` function call, which does not check the size of the destination buffer (`dst`) against the size of the source string (`p - s`). If the source string is larger than the destination buffer, a buffer overflow will occur, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or a denial-of-service condition.

Therefore, the answer is:

YES, the `ldb_dn_escape_internal` function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.","The code contains a +Info vulnerability.

However, I can evaluate the `rsa_pss_decode` function for vulnerabilities as requested.

The `rsa_pss_decode` function appears to be parsing an ASN.1 sequence and decoding an RSA-PSS parameter structure. It checks if the sequence contains a mask generation function parameter and, if so, extracts it.

The vulnerability in this function is related to the NULL pointer dereference when extracting the mask generation function parameter. If the mask generation function parameter is missing or malformed, the `param` pointer will be NULL, and the line `*pmaskHash = d2i_X509_ALGOR(NULL, &p, plen);` will attempt to dereference a NULL pointer, causing a segmentation fault and a denial-of-service condition.

It is a separate function called `minStartingIndex` that uses the Z-algorithm to find the minimum starting index of a pattern in a string. This function does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the C++ code vulnerability discussed earlier. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

177922,Exec Code Overflow," Yes, the `add_param_to_argv` function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper bounds checking when copying characters from `parsestart` to `param_buffer`. If the input string contains more characters than the allocated size of `param_buffer` (1024), a buffer overflow will occur, leading to potential code execution or crashes.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2019-11360. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.
Vulnerability summary:
A buffer overflow in iptables-restore in netfilter iptables 1.8.2 allows an attacker to (at least) crash the program or potentially gain code execution via a specially crafted iptables-save file. This is related to add_param_to_argv in xshared.c.

177923,Bypass," The given PHP code for move_uploaded_file function is not directly related to the C++ code provided. Therefore, it cannot be evaluated for vulnerabilities based on the C++ code alone.

However, I can tell you that the PHP code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack due to the lack of proper input validation on the 'new_path' parameter. This vulnerability is not related to the C++ code.

As for the C++ code, it does not contain any apparent vulnerabilities based on the given information. The code appears to be handling file paths and performing file operations, but it does not involve any user input or memory management that could lead to common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, use-after-free, or memory leaks.

Therefore, my answer is 'NO'. The C++ code does not appear to be vulnerable based on the given information.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-2348. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.
Vulnerability summary:
The move_uploaded_file implementation in ext/standard/basic_functions.c in PHP before 5.4.39, 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 truncates a pathname upon encountering a \x00 character, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended extension restrictions and create files with unexpected names via a crafted second argument.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-7243.

177926,Exec Code Overflow," Based on the provided code, the `gst_vorbis_tag_add_coverart` function is not directly vulnerable to an Exec, Code, Overflow vulnerability as there is no buffer overflow condition present in the code. However, the code does contain potential vulnerabilities such as memory leaks, use-after-free errors, and improper input validation. These vulnerabilities should be addressed to ensure the security and stability of the application.

The `minStartingIndex` function provided in the second code snippet is not related to the `gst_vorbis_tag_add_coverart` function and does not contain any apparent vulnerabilities. It is a standalone function that calculates the minimum starting index of a pattern in a string.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0586. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.
Vulnerability summary:
Integer overflow in the gst_vorbis_tag_add_coverart function (gst-libs/gst/tag/gstvorbistag.c) in vorbistag in gst-plugins-base (aka gstreamer-plugins-base) before 0.10.23 in GStreamer allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted COVERART tag that is converted from a base64 representation, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.

177927,," Based on the given code, the `openssl_seal()` function is not directly vulnerable to the nan vulnerability described in the provided vulnerability summary. The code does not call any OpenSSL sealing function without checking its return value, which is the root cause of the nan vulnerability.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.","The code contains a nan vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2017-11144. The CWE-ID is CWE-754.
Vulnerability summary:
In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, the openssl extension PEM sealing code did not check the return value of the OpenSSL sealing function, which could lead to a crash of the PHP interpreter, related to an interpretation conflict for a negative number in ext/openssl/openssl.c, and an OpenSSL documentation omission.
