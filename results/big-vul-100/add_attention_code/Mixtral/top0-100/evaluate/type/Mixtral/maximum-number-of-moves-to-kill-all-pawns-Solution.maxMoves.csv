However, there are some potential integer overflow vulnerabilities. For instance, in the function `int maxMoves(int kx, int ky, vector<vector<int>>& positions)`, there are several integer operations that could potentially overflow if the input values are not properly checked. For example, in the `bfs` function, the `dist` vector is initialized with `POS_INF` for all elements, and the `dist[nr][nc]` is updated with the sum of the previous distance and 1.

However, it does contain several potential integer overflows, which could lead to denial-of-service or possibly arbitrary code execution if a crafted PDF file is used as input. The specific integer overflows occur in the following lines:

1. `if (maskWidth > width || maskHeight > height)`
2. `n = 1 << colorMap->getBits();`
3. `for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)`

These integer overflows could potentially be exploited by an attacker to cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code. Therefore, it is recommended to validate and check the input values for these integer operations to prevent potential integer overflows.

However, it is important to note that the given code snippet might not be the only place where these integer operations occur, and there might be other parts of the codebase that could also be vulnerable to integer overflows.

177840,+Info," The `ldb_dn_escape_internal` function is not directly related to the `int maxMoves` function. The `ldb_dn_escape_internal` function appears to be a string escaping function, and based on the provided code, it does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. It checks the length of the input string and properly handles escaping characters.

However, the `int maxMoves` function is a different function that uses dynamic memory allocation and a recursive depth-first search algorithm. It is not vulnerable based on the provided code, but it does have some potential security concerns. For example, it uses a static vector and a static function for the BFS algorithm, which could lead to memory leaks or other issues if the input is large or malicious. Additionally, the function does not perform any input validation or sanitization, which could lead to buffer overflows or injection attacks if the input is not properly checked.

In summary, the `ldb_dn_escape_internal` function is not vulnerable based on the provided code, but the `int maxMoves` function has some potential security concerns that should be addressed.","The code contains a +Info vulnerability.

177841,+Info," The given code for the function `strupper_talloc_n_handle` is not directly vulnerable to the vulnerabilities listed in the provided steps. However, it does allocate memory dynamically using `talloc_array` and does not check the return value of `next_codepoint_handle_ext` before calling it. This means that if `next_codepoint_handle_ext` fails to allocate memory or returns an error, `strupper_talloc_n_handle` will continue executing and attempt to allocate more memory, potentially leading to a memory leak.

To mitigate this issue, the code should check the return value of `next_codepoint_handle_ext` and handle any errors appropriately, such as by freeing the previously allocated memory and returning an error code or null pointer.

Therefore, the answer is:

NO (with a caveat about potential memory leaks due to unchecked return values from `next_codepoint_handle_ext`).","The code contains a +Info vulnerability.

The `restore_page_device` function appears to be checking if the page devices are the same by comparing their memory addresses.

177887,DoS Overflow," The given code for the function `gs_heap_alloc_bytes` is not directly related to the `maxMoves` function provided. Therefore, I cannot determine if the `maxMoves` function is vulnerable based on the provided code alone.

However, I can evaluate the `gs_heap_alloc_bytes` function for potential vulnerabilities as requested.

The `gs_heap_alloc_bytes` function appears to be checking for size limits before allocating memory. However, it does not seem to have any bounds checking on the `size` parameter passed to the function. This could potentially lead to integer overflows if the `size` parameter is not properly validated or sanitized before being used.

Therefore, the `gs_heap_alloc_bytes` function is vulnerable to integer overflows, which could lead to denial-of-service attacks or other exploits.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `size` parameter should be validated and sanitized before being used in the calculation of `added` and other memory-related calculations. Additionally, the function should check for integer overflows before performing any memory-related operations.

In summary, the `gs_heap_alloc_bytes` function is vulnerable to integer overflows, and the `maxMoves` function is not directly related to this vulnerability.","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2019-11360. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.
Vulnerability summary:
A buffer overflow in iptables-restore in netfilter iptables 1.8.2 allows an attacker to (at least) crash the program or potentially gain code execution via a specially crafted iptables-save file. This is related to add_param_to_argv in xshared.c.

177923,Bypass," The given PHP code is not C++ code, so it is not directly related to the vulnerability audit task. However, I can evaluate the provided C++ code for potential vulnerabilities based on the steps you've outlined.

The C++ code provided does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities based on the given information. It is a recursive function to find the maximum number of moves in a given board. It does not involve any string manipulation, memory management, or user input validation, which are common sources of vulnerabilities. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-2348. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.
Vulnerability summary:
The move_uploaded_file implementation in ext/standard/basic_functions.c in PHP before 5.4.39, 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 truncates a pathname upon encountering a \x00 character, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended extension restrictions and create files with unexpected names via a crafted second argument.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-7243.

177926,Exec Code Overflow," The given gst_vorbis_tag_add_coverart function is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow. The vulnerability arises from the img_len calculation in the g_base64_decode_step function, which does not check for integer overflow. An attacker can provide a base64_len value that, when decoded, results in a larger-than-expected img_len, causing the img_data buffer to be overflowed. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.

Therefore, the answer is 'YES' and the vulnerability is an Integer Overflow/Underflow (CWE-190).","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0586. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.
Vulnerability summary:
Integer overflow in the gst_vorbis_tag_add_coverart function (gst-libs/gst/tag/gstvorbistag.c) in vorbistag in gst-plugins-base (aka gstreamer-plugins-base) before 0.10.23 in GStreamer allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted COVERART tag that is converted from a base64 representation, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.

177927,," The given PHP code does not contain any C++ code, so it cannot be evaluated for C++ vulnerabilities directly. The code snippet is written in PHP, and the vulnerability mentioned in the text is related to an OpenSSL function used in PHP. Therefore, the answer is: NO.","The code contains a nan vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2017-11144. The CWE-ID is CWE-754.
Vulnerability summary:
In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, the openssl extension PEM sealing code did not check the return value of the OpenSSL sealing function, which could lead to a crash of the PHP interpreter, related to an interpretation conflict for a negative number in ext/openssl/openssl.c, and an OpenSSL documentation omission.
