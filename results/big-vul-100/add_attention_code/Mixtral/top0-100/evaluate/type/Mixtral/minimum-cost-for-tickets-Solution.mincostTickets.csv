177922,Exec Code Overflow, The given code for `add_param_to_argv` function is vulnerable. The reason is that it does not properly check the length of the input string before copying it to the `param_buffer`. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is longer than the allocated size of `param_buffer`. This can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause the program to crash.,"The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2019-11360. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.
Vulnerability summary:
A buffer overflow in iptables-restore in netfilter iptables 1.8.2 allows an attacker to (at least) crash the program or potentially gain code execution via a specially crafted iptables-save file. This is related to add_param_to_argv in xshared.c.

177923,Bypass," The given PHP code is not C++ code, so it is not directly related to the vulnerability audit task. However, I can evaluate the potential vulnerabilities in the provided PHP code based on the given information.

The PHP code does not appear to contain any obvious buffer overflow, use-after-free, memory leak, or integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities. It does involve user input (file paths), but it uses the zend_parse_parameters function to validate and sanitize the inputs, which should help prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.

However, the code does not appear to perform any bounds checking on the file paths, and it uses the VCWD_RENAME and VCWD_CHMOD functions without checking their return values. This could potentially allow for file path traversal attacks or other vulnerabilities if the underlying operating system is not properly secured.

Additionally, the code uses the umask function to change the file permissions, but it does not restore the original umask value after the operation. This could potentially lead to unintended file permission changes if the code is executed multiple times or in a multi-threaded environment.

Overall, the code may be vulnerable to file path traversal attacks and unintended file permission changes. However, without more context or information about the underlying operating system and environment, it is difficult to determine the exact vulnerabilities or risks.

As for the C++ code","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

Vulnerability summary:
The move_uploaded_file implementation in ext/standard/basic_functions.c in PHP before 5.4.39, 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 truncates a pathname upon encountering a \x00 character, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended extension restrictions and create files with unexpected names via a crafted second argument.

177926,Exec Code Overflow," The given C++ code for `gst_vorbis_tag_add_coverart` function is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow issue when decoding base64 image data. The `img_len` variable is not checked against the actual size of the allocated memory before being used to populate the image buffer. This can lead to writing beyond the allocated memory, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
