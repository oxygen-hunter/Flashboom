177883,," Based on the provided code, there are no obvious buffer overflow, use-after-free, memory leak, integer overflow/underflow, null pointer dereference, or race condition vulnerabilities. However, there are some potential issues related to input validation and error handling:

1. Improper Input Validation (CWE-20): The code does not validate the input `tags` when calling `string_split()`. This function may not handle empty strings or null pointers properly, leading to potential buffer overflows or other issues. It is recommended to validate and sanitize the input before passing it to this function.

2. Improper Error Handling (CWE-248): The code does not check the return value of `malloc()` and `strdup()` functions. If these functions fail, the code will continue execution, potentially leading to memory leaks or other issues. It is recommended to check the return values and handle errors appropriately.

However, these issues do not directly result in a nan vulnerability as described in the provided vulnerability summary. The code snippet provided does not involve SSL chat servers, GnuTLS API, or certificate validation, so it is not vulnerable to the nan vulnerability mentioned in the summary.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

177887,DoS Overflow," The given C++ code for `gs_heap_alloc_bytes` function is not directly related to the `minimumCost` function provided. Therefore, I cannot evaluate the vulnerability of the `minimumCost` function based on the given code.

Regarding the `gs_heap_alloc_bytes` function, it appears to be checking the size of the allocation request against the available memory limit. However, there is no explicit check for integer overflow in the code. Since the size is being added to `added` variable, which is then compared with `mmem->limit - mmem->used`, there is a potential risk of integer overflow if the input size is not properly validated. This could lead to a DoS condition as the code might allocate more memory than intended, causing a memory exhaustion attack.

Therefore, the answer is:

YES, the `gs_heap_alloc_bytes` function is vulnerable to a DoS attack due to the potential for integer overflow.","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

However, I can evaluate the `rsa_pss_decode` function for vulnerabilities as requested:

The `rsa_pss_decode` function appears to be parsing an ASN.1 sequence and decoding an RSA-PSS parameter structure. It checks if the sequence contains a mask generation function parameter and, if so, extracts it.

There doesn't seem to be any obvious vulnerabilities in the code. However, it is important to note that the function relies on the `d2i_RSA_PSS_PARAMS` and `d2i_X509_ALGOR` functions, which are not shown in the code snippet. These functions could potentially have vulnerabilities if they are not implemented correctly or if they are using vulnerable libraries.

Therefore, it is recommended to thoroughly review the implementation of these functions and ensure that they are using secure coding practices to prevent any potential vulnerabilities.

177926,Exec Code Overflow," The given C++ code for `gst_vorbis_tag_add_coverart` function is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow issue when decoding base64 image data. The code does not properly check the size of the decoded image data before storing it in a buffer, allowing an attacker to provide maliciously crafted base64 data that can cause a heap-based buffer overflow. This can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0586. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.
Vulnerability summary:
Integer overflow in the gst_vorbis_tag_add_coverart function (gst-libs/gst/tag/gstvorbistag.c) in vorbistag in gst-plugins-base (aka gstreamer-plugins-base) before 0.10.23 in GStreamer allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted COVERART tag that is converted from a base64 representation, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.

177927,," The given PHP code does not directly relate to the C++ code provided, so it cannot be evaluated for vulnerabilities based on the information given. The PHP code appears to be handling user input and managing OpenSSL keys, but it does not contain any C++ code or any indications of C++ vulnerabilities. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.","The code contains a nan vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2017-11144. The CWE-ID is CWE-754.
Vulnerability summary:
In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, the openssl extension PEM sealing code did not check the return value of the OpenSSL sealing function, which could lead to a crash of the PHP interpreter, related to an interpretation conflict for a negative number in ext/openssl/openssl.c, and an OpenSSL documentation omission.
