177740,DoS Exec Code Overflow Mem. Corr.," The given C++ code for the `asn1_time_to_time_t` function is vulnerable. The vulnerability is related to a buffer overflow issue, specifically a memory corruption vulnerability. The vulnerability arises from the way the code parses the time string, which can lead to writing past the end of the allocated memory for the `strbuf` variable. This can result in arbitrary code execution or a denial of service attack.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in CVE-2013-6420, where the `openssl.c` library in PHP is affected by a failure to properly parse X.509 certificates, leading to a memory corruption vulnerability.

In the given code, the `strbuf` variable is allocated based on the length of the input `timestr->data`. However, the code does not check if the length of the parsed time string exceeds the allocated size of `strbuf`. If the input is maliciously crafted, it can cause a buffer overflow, leading to memory corruption and potential code execution.

However, I can provide some general advice on the `maxProfit` function:

The `maxProfit` function appears to be implementing a variation of the ""Buy and Sell by Sliding Window"" problem. It looks correct at first glance, but it's essential to ensure that the input vector `prices` is valid and that the function handles edge cases properly.

Here are some potential issues to consider:

1. Empty or one-element input: The function should handle the case when the input vector is empty or has only one element.
2. Negative prices: The function should ensure that all prices are non-negative.
3. Large input: The function should handle large inputs efficiently.
4. Overlapping intervals: The function should ensure that it doesn't count the same profit multiple times when intervals overlap.
5. Corner cases: The function should be tested with various corner cases, such as all prices being the same, or prices increasing and then decreasing.

However, it is always a good practice to validate user inputs and ensure proper error handling in C++ code as well.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-2348. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.
Vulnerability summary:
The move_uploaded_file implementation in ext/standard/basic_functions.c in PHP before 5.4.39, 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 truncates a pathname upon encountering a \x00 character, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended extension restrictions and create files with unexpected names via a crafted second argument.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-7243.

177926,Exec Code Overflow," The given C++ code for `gst_vorbis_tag_add_coverart` function is not directly related to the code snippet you provided earlier, which was vulnerable to an Exec_Code_Overflow. The `maxProfit` function you provided is a different function and does not contain any apparent vulnerabilities. It appears to be implementing a solution to the problem of finding the maximum profit from buying and selling a certain number of items at various prices, which is a common problem in computer science.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'. The `maxProfit` function does not contain any apparent vulnerabilities.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0586. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.
Vulnerability summary:
Integer overflow in the gst_vorbis_tag_add_coverart function (gst-libs/gst/tag/gstvorbistag.c) in vorbistag in gst-plugins-base (aka gstreamer-plugins-base) before 0.10.23 in GStreamer allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted COVERART tag that is converted from a base64 representation, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.

177927,," The given PHP code is not C++ code, so it cannot be directly evaluated for vulnerabilities using the steps provided for C++ code. The steps provided are for conducting a vulnerability audit on C++ code. The code snippet you've given is written in PHP, and it would require a different approach to evaluate its vulnerabilities.

To audit PHP code for vulnerabilities, you would need to follow a different set of guidelines, such as checking for SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and other PHP-specific vulnerabilities. You can refer to the OWASP PHP Security Cheat Sheet for more information on auditing PHP code.","The code contains a nan vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2017-11144. The CWE-ID is CWE-754.
Vulnerability summary:
In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, the openssl extension PEM sealing code did not check the return value of the OpenSSL sealing function, which could lead to a crash of the PHP interpreter, related to an interpretation conflict for a negative number in ext/openssl/openssl.c, and an OpenSSL documentation omission.
