177787,DoS Exec Code Overflow," Based on the given code, the SplashOutputDev::drawMaskedImage function does not appear to contain any obvious buffer overflow vulnerabilities. However, it does contain several potential integer overflow vulnerabilities, as integers are not checked for overflow conditions when they are assigned values like width, height, maskWidth, maskHeight, and n. This could potentially lead to incorrect calculations and unintended behavior.

To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to validate and check the input values for overflow conditions before using them in arithmetic operations. Additionally, it is a good practice to use standard C++ libraries for handling common data types and operations, such as std::vector and std::string, instead of implementing custom data structures and manipulating raw memory.

Therefore, the answer is:

YES (Integer Overflow)

The code is vulnerable to integer overflow vulnerabilities, which could potentially lead to incorrect calculations and unintended behavior. This can be mitigated by validating and checking input values for overflow conditions before using them in arithmetic operations. It is also recommended to use standard C++ libraries for handling common data types and operations.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The code divides the base64 length by 4 and then multiplies it by 3 to get the size of the decoded image data. However, this calculation does not take into account the possibility of the base64 length being a multiple of 4, which would result in an incorrect size calculation and a buffer overflow when decoding the image data.

Therefore, the answer is 'YES' and the vulnerability is due to an Integer Overflow issue.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0586. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.
Vulnerability summary:
Integer overflow in the gst_vorbis_tag_add_coverart function (gst-libs/gst/tag/gstvorbistag.c) in vorbistag in gst-plugins-base (aka gstreamer-plugins-base) before 0.10.23 in GStreamer allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted COVERART tag that is converted from a base64 representation, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.

It does not involve any OpenSSL functions or memory management that could lead to the types of vulnerabilities mentioned in the original question. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.","The code contains a nan vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2017-11144. The CWE-ID is CWE-754.
Vulnerability summary:
In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, the openssl extension PEM sealing code did not check the return value of the OpenSSL sealing function, which could lead to a crash of the PHP interpreter, related to an interpretation conflict for a negative number in ext/openssl/openssl.c, and an OpenSSL documentation omission.
