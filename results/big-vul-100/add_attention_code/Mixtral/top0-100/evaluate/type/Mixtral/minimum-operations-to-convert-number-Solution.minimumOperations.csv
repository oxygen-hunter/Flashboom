177922,Exec Code Overflow," Yes, the `add_param_to_argv` function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The `param_buffer` array has a fixed size of 1024 bytes, but there is no check on the length of the parameter being parsed. If a malicious user provides a long enough parameter, it can be written beyond the bounds of the `param_buffer` array, leading to a buffer overflow. This can result in arbitrary code execution or a denial-of-service attack.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2019-11360. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.
Vulnerability summary:
A buffer overflow in iptables-restore in netfilter iptables 1.8.2 allows an attacker to (at least) crash the program or potentially gain code execution via a specially crafted iptables-save file. This is related to add_param_to_argv in xshared.c.

177923,Bypass," The given PHP code for move_uploaded_file function is not directly related to the provided C++ code. Therefore, it cannot be evaluated for vulnerabilities based on the provided C++ code alone.

However, I can tell you that the PHP code is vulnerable to a file path traversal attack, as described in the vulnerability summary provided. This issue is not related to the C++ code.

As for the C++ code, it does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities based on the provided information. The code appears to be a function for finding the minimum number of operations required to reach a goal number using a given set of numbers. It does not involve any file I/O, memory management, or other operations that could potentially lead to vulnerabilities.

Therefore, my answer is 'NO'. The C++ code is not vulnerable based on the provided information.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-2348. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.
Vulnerability summary:
The move_uploaded_file implementation in ext/standard/basic_functions.c in PHP before 5.4.39, 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 truncates a pathname upon encountering a \x00 character, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended extension restrictions and create files with unexpected names via a crafted second argument.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-7243.

177926,Exec Code Overflow," The given gst_vorbis_tag_add_coverart function is vulnerable. The issue is related to a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the lack of proper bounds checking when decoding base64 image data. The img_len variable is not checked against the actual size of the decoded image data, allowing for potential overflow conditions. This can lead to arbitrary code execution or memory corruption.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0586. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.
Vulnerability summary:
Integer overflow in the gst_vorbis_tag_add_coverart function (gst-libs/gst/tag/gstvorbistag.c) in vorbistag in gst-plugins-base (aka gstreamer-plugins-base) before 0.10.23 in GStreamer allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted COVERART tag that is converted from a base64 representation, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.

177927,," Based on the given code, the `openssl_seal()` function in the PHP extension does not directly interact with C++ code. Instead, it uses OpenSSL library functions, which are written in C. Therefore, the code snippet provided does not directly relate to the vulnerability described in the CVE-2017-11144.

However, it's essential to understand that the vulnerability lies in the OpenSSL library itself, not in the PHP extension code. The PHP extension code only calls the vulnerable OpenSSL functions.

So, the answer is: NO, the provided C++ code is not vulnerable in this context. However, the OpenSSL library functions called within the PHP extension code might be vulnerable to the nan issue (CVE-2017-11144).","The code contains a nan vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2017-11144. The CWE-ID is CWE-754.
Vulnerability summary:
In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, the openssl extension PEM sealing code did not check the return value of the OpenSSL sealing function, which could lead to a crash of the PHP interpreter, related to an interpretation conflict for a negative number in ext/openssl/openssl.c, and an OpenSSL documentation omission.
