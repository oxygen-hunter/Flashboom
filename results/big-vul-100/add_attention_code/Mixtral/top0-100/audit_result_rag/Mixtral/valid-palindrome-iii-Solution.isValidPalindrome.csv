However, there is a potential issue with the use of `snprintf` function. If the `destFileName` string contains a large number for the page number, it could result in a buffer overflow. To mitigate this, the size of the `pathName` array should be checked against the length of the formatted string before using `snprintf`.

However, the code snippet provided does not contain the `printUsage` function call, which is used inside the for loop. It is unclear if this function call is checking the size of the formatted string before using `snprintf`. If it is not, then this could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

However, it is essential to note that the `fz_chartorune` function called within the loop is not shown in the code snippet. If this function contains any buffer overflow vulnerabilities, it could potentially affect the security of the `walk_string` function. Therefore, it is crucial to thoroughly examine the implementation of `fz_chartorune` to ensure it is free of buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

In summary, the `walk_string` function itself does not seem to be vulnerable to buffer overflow, but it depends on the implementation of the `fz_chartorune` function.
