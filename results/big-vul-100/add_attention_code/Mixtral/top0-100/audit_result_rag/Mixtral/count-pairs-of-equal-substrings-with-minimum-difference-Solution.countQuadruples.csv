177907,DoS Exec Code Overflow," Based on the given code, the `Splash::scaleMaskYuXd` function does not appear to be directly vulnerable to the mentioned vulnerabilities (DoS, Exec, Code, Overflow) as it does not involve user input, memory allocation beyond the bounds of the allocated memory, or the use of insecure functions. However, it does contain some potential issues, such as the nested loops that iterate over `srcHeight` twice, which could potentially be optimized. Additionally, the use of `gmalloc` and `gfree` for memory allocation and deallocation could potentially hide memory leaks or other issues if not used correctly. It is recommended to review the implementation of the `(*src)` function and ensure that it properly handles memory allocation and deallocation, as well as any potential user input or other potential vulnerabilities.

The `countQuadruples` function, on the other hand, does not appear to be directly vulnerable to the mentioned vulnerabilities as it does not involve memory allocation, user input, or the use of insecure functions. However, it does contain some potential issues, such as the use of `numeric_limits<int>::max()` which could potentially hide integer overflows or underflows if not handled properly. It is recommended to review the use of this constant and ensure that it is used correctly in the context of the function.
