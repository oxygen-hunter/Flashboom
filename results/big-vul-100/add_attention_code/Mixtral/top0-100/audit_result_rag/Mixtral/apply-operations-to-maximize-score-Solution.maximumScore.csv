The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly check the length of the data being read from the network response, allowing an attacker to write more data than intended into the allocated memory. This can result in arbitrary code execution or denial-of-service attacks.

The vulnerability is due to the following lines in the code:

```c++
