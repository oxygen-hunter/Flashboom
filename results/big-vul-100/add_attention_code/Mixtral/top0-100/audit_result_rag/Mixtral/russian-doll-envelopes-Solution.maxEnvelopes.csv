However, I can evaluate the `asn1_time_to_time_t` function for vulnerabilities as requested in the initial question.

Answer for `asn1_time_to_time_t`:

YES, the `asn1_time_to_time_t` function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow issue. The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper bounds checking when parsing the time string. The code extracts each component of the time string using `atoi` and assumes that the input string is always 13 characters long. If the input string is longer than expected, it can lead to a buffer overflow when writing to the `thestr` pointer. This can result in arbitrary code execution or a denial of service (DoS) attack.
