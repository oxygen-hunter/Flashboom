However, it's important to note that the `executeInstructions` function may still have other vulnerabilities or issues that are not related to the ones mentioned in the steps. For example, it uses a static unordered_map, which may lead to memory leaks or other issues if not managed properly. Additionally, the function uses recursive calls to itself, which could potentially lead to stack overflow attacks if the input is not properly validated.

To thoroughly evaluate the security of the `executeInstructions` function, it would be necessary to perform a more comprehensive analysis, including checking for proper input validation, memory management, and error handling.",1423,192,10.445444345474243
177911,Exec Code Overflow," The given `tt_cmap10_validate` function is not directly related to the `executeInstructions` function provided. Therefore, I cannot determine if the `executeInstructions` function is vulnerable based on the information given.

Regarding the `tt_cmap10_validate` function, it does not appear to be vulnerable to the Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability described in the provided context. The code snippet does not involve any arithmetic operations on user-supplied data or unchecked calculations that could lead to integer overflows.

However, it is essential to note that the `tt_cmap10_validate` function might still have other vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, or memory leaks, which are not covered in the provided vulnerability audit steps. It is always recommended to thoroughly review the code and follow secure coding practices to mitigate potential risks.",1288,200,10.80806589126587
177912,Exec Code Overflow," Based on the provided code snippet, the `tt_cmap12_validate` function itself does not appear to be vulnerable to the Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability described in the given vulnerability summary. The vulnerability in the summary is related to a different part of the FreeType library.

However, the code does contain other potential vulnerabilities, such as integer overflows and unvalidated user inputs, which should be addressed. The `executeInstructions` function, which is not shown in the provided code snippet, may be vulnerable to these types of issues. It is important to validate and sanitize inputs, and perform proper bounds checking on arithmetic operations to prevent integer overflows.

Therefore, the answer is:

NO (regarding the `tt_cmap12_validate` function specifically)

YES (regarding the potential vulnerabilities in the code as a whole)",1526,197,10.74835729598999
177913,Exec Code Overflow," Based on the provided code snippet, the `tt_cmap8_validate` function does not appear to be directly vulnerable to integer overflows or buffer overflows. However, it does perform some bounds checking on input data, so if that data is not properly validated before being passed to this function, it could potentially lead to vulnerabilities.

The `executeInstructions` function, on the other hand, does contain some potential vulnerabilities. The `iota` function is used to initialize a vector with numbers from 1 to the size of the input string `s`. However, there is no check to ensure that the size of `s` is not too large, which could lead to a buffer overflow if `s` contains more characters than the allocated memory can hold. Additionally, the `lookup_x` and `lookup_y` unordered maps are used to store vectors of indices, but there is no check to ensure that the indices being added to these maps are valid. If an attacker can manipulate the input `s` to cause these maps to store invalid indices, it could potentially lead to out-of-bounds array accesses or other vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the answer is: 'YES', the `executeInstructions` function contains potential vulnerabilities related to buffer overflows and out-of-bounds array accesses if the input `s` is not properly validated.",2528,297,16.064746618270874

177927,nan," Based on the given code, the `openssl_seal()` function in the provided PHP extension code is not directly vulnerable to the nan vulnerability described in the CVE-2017-11144. The nan vulnerability is related to the OpenSSL sealing function not checking its return value, which is not the case in the provided code.

However, the code does have other potential vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, and memory leaks, which should be addressed in a thorough vulnerability audit.

For example, the `buf` memory allocation in the following line:

`buf = emalloc(data_len + EVP_CIPHER_CTX_block_size(ctx));`

should check the return value of `emalloc()` and handle the case where it returns `NULL` appropriately to prevent a memory leak.
