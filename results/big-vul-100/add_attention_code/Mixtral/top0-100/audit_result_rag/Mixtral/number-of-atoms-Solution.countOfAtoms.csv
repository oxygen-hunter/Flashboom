2. Improper Resource Management:
   - In the function, resources like `maskImage`, `image`, and `pattern` are created and then destroyed without proper error checking. This can lead to unintended consequences if the resource creation fails.

To mitigate these issues, consider the following:

1. Memory Leaks:
   - Free the memory allocated for `maskImgStr` and `imgStr` after use.

177919,nan," Based on the provided code, there are no obvious buffer overflow, use-after-free, memory leak, or integer overflow vulnerabilities. However, there are some potential issues:

1. The code does not validate user input (pattern) before passing it to XSend. This could potentially lead to injection attacks or other vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized.
2. The code does not check for race conditions when accessing shared resources (dpy). This could potentially lead to inconsistent program states or data corruption if the application is multi-threaded.
3. The code does not properly handle errors or exceptions. If an error occurs during memory allocation or XReply processing, the code may not properly release resources or return an error code.
4. The code uses some deprecated functions like Xmalloc and Xfree. It is recommended to use new C++ memory management functions like std::vector or std::unique_ptr instead.
