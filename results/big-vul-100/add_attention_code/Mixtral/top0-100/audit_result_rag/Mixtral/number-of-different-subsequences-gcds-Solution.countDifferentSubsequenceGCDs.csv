However, it does contain a hardcoded error message for each UAC bit, which could potentially leak information if an attacker is able to trigger an error condition. Additionally, the function appears to be checking for specific rights on a domain object, which could potentially be bypassed if an attacker is able to manipulate the domain object in question.
