However, it does contain some complex logic and dynamic memory management, so it's still important to ensure proper input validation, error handling, and resource management.

The code does not directly interact with user input, and it uses standard library functions like `vector` and `numeric_limits`, which are less prone to common vulnerabilities compared to custom string or memory handling functions.

However, it's important to note that the code does contain some complex logic and dynamic memory management, so it's still crucial to ensure proper input validation, error handling, and resource management. For example, the `positions` vector may contain user-supplied data, so it's essential to validate and sanitize that data to prevent potential injection attacks or other vulnerabilities.

In summary, while the code snippet does not appear to contain any obvious buffer overflow, use-after-free, memory leak, or integer overflow vulnerabilities, it's still important to ensure proper input validation, error handling, and resource management to mitigate potential risks.

Answer: NO.",2290,256,13.871866464614868
177909,DoS Exec Code Overflow," The given `Splash::scaleMaskYdXu` function is not directly vulnerable to the mentioned vulnerabilities in the provided list. However, it does have some potential issues:

1. Memory management: The code uses `gmalloc` and `gfree` for dynamic memory allocation, which is not the recommended way for C++ memory management. Instead, use `new` and `delete` or `std::vector` for better memory management.
2. Buffer overflows: Although not directly present in the given code, the `(*src)(srcData, lineBuf)` call could potentially lead to buffer overflows if the `src` function is not properly validating its inputs.
3. Race conditions: The code does not use any synchronization mechanisms for the shared `destPtr` pointer, which could potentially lead to race conditions if the function is called concurrently.

However, the second function `maxMoves` provided in the code snippet is not related to the `Splash::scaleMaskYdXu` function and does not seem to have any apparent vulnerabilities. It is a standalone function that performs a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm and calculates the maximum number of moves in a given game situation.",2276,268,14.485993146896362
177910,DoS," The second code snippet provided, `token_continue(i_ctx_t *i_ctx_p, scanner_state * pstate, bool save)`, is not vulnerable to the DoS vulnerability described in the first code snippet or the vulnerability types listed in the initial question. It is a separate function that appears to be handling scanner state in Ghostscript.

The second code snippet, `int maxMoves(int kx, int ky, vector<vector<int>>& positions)`, is not vulnerable to any of the vulnerability types mentioned in the initial question. It is a separate function that calculates the maximum number of moves for a given knight position on an 8x8 chessboard. The function uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to calculate the shortest path between each position and the given knight position. The function does not involve any string or memory functions, dynamic memory management, arithmetic operations, pointers, or user input, which are the primary sources of vulnerabilities in the initial question.",1865,229,12.428079843521118
177911,Exec Code Overflow," The given `tt_cmap10_validate` function does not appear to be vulnerable to the Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability described in the provided context. The function is checking bounds and validating input lengths, which helps prevent integer overflows and other related vulnerabilities.

However, the `maxMoves` function is a different piece of code, and it is not directly related to the `tt_cmap10_validate` function. The `maxMoves` function is a complex function that uses dynamic memory allocation and bitwise operations. It is essential to thoroughly analyze this function to identify any potential vulnerabilities.

To perform a vulnerability audit on the `maxMoves` function, follow the steps mentioned earlier in the provided order. This will help you identify any potential vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, memory leaks, integer overflows, null pointer dereferences, improper input validation, race conditions, insecure function usage, insecure resource management, and improper error handling.

Based on the given code snippet, it is not possible to determine if the `maxMoves` function is vulnerable without a thorough analysis. Therefore, the answer is 'NO', but with the understanding that the `maxMoves` function requires further investigation to ensure its security.",1730,282,15.185868263244629
