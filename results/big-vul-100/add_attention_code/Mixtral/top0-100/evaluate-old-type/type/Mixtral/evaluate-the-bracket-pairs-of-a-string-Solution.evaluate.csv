However, there is a separate issue in the `evaluate` function defined later in the code. This function has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of `push_back` without checking the size of the string before appending new characters.

The `evaluate` function uses a `vector<vector<string>>` named `knowledge` and an `unordered_map<string, string>` named `lookup`. It iterates through the `knowledge` vector and populates the `lookup` map. Inside the for loop, it appends characters to the `curr` string and then to the `result` string using the `push_back` function.
