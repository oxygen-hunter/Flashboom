However, the `majorityElement` function in the second code snippet might be vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks if the input vector `nums` is large enough. The function iterates through the vector multiple times, and each iteration may take a significant amount of time depending on the size of the input. An attacker could potentially cause a denial-of-service by providing a large enough input vector to cause the function to take an excessive amount of time to execute.

Here's a brief explanation of the vulnerability:

The `majorityElement` function uses a hash map to keep track of the occurrence of each integer in the input vector `nums`. It then iterates through the vector again to count the occurrence of each candidate integer in the hash map. The function returns a vector containing the integers that occur more than `n / k` times, where `n` is the size of the input vector and `k` is a constant.
