The `aspath_put` function appears to be responsible for writing AS Paths to a stream.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the function should check the length of the AS Paths being written to the stream against the available writable space in the stream before writing any data. If the length of the AS Paths exceeds the available writable space, the function should return an error or reject the AS Paths to prevent potential DoS attacks.
