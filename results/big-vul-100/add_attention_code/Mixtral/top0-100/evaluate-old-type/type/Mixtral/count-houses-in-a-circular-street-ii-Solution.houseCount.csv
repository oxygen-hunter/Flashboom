The `houseCount` function, on the other hand, does contain a potential vulnerability. The function attempts to close the door after checking if `i` is non-zero and the door is open. However, there is no check to ensure that the door is actually a door (i.e., that `street` is a valid `Street` object). If `street` is a null pointer or an invalid object, attempting to call `isDoorOpen()` or `closeDoor()` on it will result in a null pointer dereference and a crash.
