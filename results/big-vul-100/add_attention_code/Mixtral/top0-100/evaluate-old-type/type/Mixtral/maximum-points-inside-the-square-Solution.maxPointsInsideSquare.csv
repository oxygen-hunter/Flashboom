However, there is a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `maxPointsInsideSquare` function, which is not directly related to the `extractPages` function.

The `maxPointsInsideSquare` function calculates the maximum distance of points inside a square from the center of the square. It then checks if this distance is smaller than the corresponding character in a given string. If it is, it increments a counter. If the counter is greater than the number of points inside the square that have a smaller distance, the result is the number of such points.

The potential integer overflow vulnerability occurs when calculating the absolute value of the x and y coordinates of a point. If the point is outside the square, the absolute value of its coordinates can be larger than the maximum representable value of an int, causing an integer overflow. This can lead to incorrect results or even crashes if the integer overflow is not handled properly.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you can use a larger data type, such as a long long int, to store the coordinates and their absolute values. Alternatively, you can ensure that the points are within the square before processing them in the `maxPointsInsideSquare` function.

YES, the `rsa_pss_decode` function is vulnerable to a DoS attack due to a NULL pointer dereference. The vulnerability arises from the following condition:

```c++
if (pss->maskGenAlgorithm) {

In this condition, the `pmaskHash` pointer is assigned the result of `d2i_X509_ALGOR(NULL, &p, plen)` only when `pss->maskGenAlgorithm` is not NULL. If `pss->maskGenAlgorithm` is NULL, the `pmaskHash` pointer remains uninitialized, and later in the function, it is dereferenced, causing a NULL pointer dereference and application crash.
