Since the provided C++ code is a part of the PHP extension, it is possible that the vulnerability exists in the underlying PHP code that is being called by this C++ function. Therefore, it is recommended to thoroughly review the PHP code and ensure that it is not vulnerable to XXE attacks.

As for the `findSafeWalk` function, it appears to be a standalone C++ function that does not involve any input from external sources or file I/O operations. Therefore, it is unlikely to be vulnerable to the types of attacks mentioned in the provided vulnerability audit steps.
