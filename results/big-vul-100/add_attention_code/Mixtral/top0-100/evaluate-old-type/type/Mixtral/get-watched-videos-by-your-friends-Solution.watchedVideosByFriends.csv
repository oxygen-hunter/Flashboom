However, the code does involve the use of standard C++ libraries and data structures, so it is still important to follow secure coding practices. Some potential issues to consider:

1. Buffer Overflow: In the `watchedVideosByFriends` function, there are no bounds checks on the indices when accessing `watchedVideos` and `friends`. This could potentially lead to buffer overflow if the indices are out of bounds.
2. Use-After-Free: In the `watchedVideosByFriends` function, the `lookup` set is modified within the loop, and then used to look up elements in the `friends` vector. If an element is removed from the `friends` vector while the loop is running, the `lookup` set will contain an invalid index, which could lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities.
3. Integer Overflow: In the `watchedVideosByFriends` function, there are no checks for integer overflow when calculating indices or when adding elements to the `new_level` vector. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
4. Memory Management: In the `watchedVideosBy",nan,0.0,725.0,6.0,0.8549795150756836
