177922,Exec Code Overflow," The given code for the function `add_param_to_argv` is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow issue. The `param_buffer` array has a fixed size of 1024 bytes, but the code does not perform any bounds checking when copying characters into this buffer. If a long enough input string is provided, it can cause the buffer to overflow, leading to arbitrary code execution or a crash.

The vulnerability is present in the following lines:

```cpp
param_buffer[param_len++] = *curchar;
if (param_len >= sizeof(param_buffer))
	xtables_error(PARAMETER_PROBLEM, ""Parameter too long!"");
continue;
```

The check for the buffer size is not performed before copying a character to the buffer, allowing the buffer to be overflowed when a large input string is encountered.
