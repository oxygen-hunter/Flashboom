However, the code does contain a nested loop that iterates through `scaledHeight` and `srcWidth` multiple times, which could potentially be used as a vector for a denial-of-service (DoS) attack if the function is called with large values for `scaledWidth` and `scaledHeight`. This could cause the function to consume excessive resources and potentially crash the application.

Therefore, the answer is:

YES - DoS vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not perform any checks on the input values of `scaledWidth` and `scaledHeight`. An attacker could potentially pass large values to these parameters, causing the function to iterate through a large number of pixels, consuming excessive resources and potentially crashing the application.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the function should include checks on the input values of `scaledWidth` and `scaledHeight` to ensure they are within reasonable bounds. This can be done by adding a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that `scaledWidth` and `scaledHeight` are not excessively large. For example, the check could be implemented as follows:
