The vulnerability arises from the `snprintf` function call in the loop where the `pathName` buffer is filled with the formatted string. If the input `destFileName` contains a large number for the `%d` placeholder, the `snprintf` function may not be able to write the entire formatted string into the `pathName` buffer, resulting in a truncation. This truncation may cause the `snprintf` function to write beyond the end of the buffer, leading to undefined behavior and potentially a denial-of-service condition.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `snprintf` function should be replaced with a safer alternative such as `snprintf_s` or `sprintf_s` (if available on the platform), or the size of the `pathName` buffer should be increased to accommodate the largest possible input.
