YES, the `asn1_time_to_time_t` function is vulnerable. The vulnerability is related to the lack of proper bounds checking when parsing the time string. An attacker could potentially provide a maliciously crafted time string that is longer than expected, leading to a buffer overflow. This could result in arbitrary code execution or a denial of service.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in CVE-2013-6420, where the `openssl_x509_parse` function in PHP fails to properly parse the notBefore and notAfter timestamps in X.509 certificates, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption).

177887,DoS Overflow," The given C++ code for `gs_heap_alloc_bytes` function is vulnerable to a DoS attack through integer overflow. The vulnerability allows an attacker to allocate more memory than the limit, causing the program to crash or behave unexpectedly. This can lead to a denial-of-service condition.

The code does not properly check the size argument before allocating memory. The check `if (size > mmem->limit - sizeof(gs_malloc_block_t))` only ensures that the size is less than the limit minus the size of the block header. However, it does not prevent the size from being larger than the limit itself. This can be exploited by an attacker to allocate more memory than the limit, causing a buffer overflow or a crash.

Therefore, the answer is 'YES' and the vulnerability is of type 'DoS'. The CVE-ID for this vulnerability is CVE-2015-3228, and the CWE-ID is CWE-189.",DoS Overflow,3.0,649.0,6.0,0.8934807777404785
