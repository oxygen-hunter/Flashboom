However, it does contain a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `minOperations` function, which is defined outside of the `extractPages` function. The `minOperations` function calculates the minimum number of operations required to reduce all numbers in a vector to 1. It uses the `gcd` function to find the greatest common divisor of each pair of numbers, and if the greatest common divisor is 1, it returns the index difference between the current and next number. If the greatest common divisor is not 1, it continues to the next pair. If all numbers in the vector have a greatest common divisor of 1, it returns the size of the vector minus the number of 1s in the vector.

The potential integer overflow vulnerability arises from the fact that the `minOperations` function uses the `numeric_limits<int>::max()` constant to represent an infinite value. If the vector contains very large numbers, the calculation of the minimum number of operations could result in an integer overflow, leading to incorrect results or undefined behavior.

1. Look for potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities in string and memory functions like strcpy, sprintf, and array access. Ensure proper bounds checking is implemented to prevent writing or reading outside the allocated memory space.
2. Identify use-after-free errors by tracing pointer lifetimes. Check if pointers are used after the memory they point to has been deallocated.
3. Inspect dynamic memory management. Look for missing or improper calls to free() after allocating memory using malloc(). Memory leaks can degrade system performance or lead to denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities.
4. Check arithmetic operations, especially on integer types, for overflow or underflow conditions. Look for unvalidated user inputs or unchecked calculations that can cause integers to wrap around, leading to incorrect results or buffer miscalculations.
5. Ensure error handling mechanisms are robust. Check for areas where exceptions or errors are ignored or mishandled, as",nan,0.0,720.0,6.0,1.0277719497680664
