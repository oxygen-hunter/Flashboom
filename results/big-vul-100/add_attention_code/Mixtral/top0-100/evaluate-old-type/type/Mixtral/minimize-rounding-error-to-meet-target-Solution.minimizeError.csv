If the target price is outside the range of the prices, the function returns ""-1"". If the target price is within the range, it calculates the sum of the absolute differences for the prices within the target range and returns the sum as a string with 4 decimal places.

The potential integer overflow vulnerability occurs when the sum of the absolute differences for the prices within the target range exceeds the maximum representable value of an `int` or `long long int` data type. In such a case, the sum would wrap around, resulting in an incorrect value. This could potentially lead to incorrect calculations and unexpected behavior.

To mitigate this vulnerability, consider using a larger data type, such as `long long int`, to store the sum of the absolute differences. Alternatively, you could use a numerical library, such as Boost.Multiprecision, to handle arbitrary-precision arithmetic.
