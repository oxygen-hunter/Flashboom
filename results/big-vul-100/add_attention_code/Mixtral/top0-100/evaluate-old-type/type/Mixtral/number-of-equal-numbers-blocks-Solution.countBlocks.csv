If the `dir` parameter is not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially provide a malicious directory path that includes `../` or other similar sequences to traverse up the directory structure and access sensitive files or directories.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the `dir` parameter before using it in the `manifest` hash table traversal. One possible solution would be to use a function like `realpath()` or `canonicalize_file_name()` to ensure that the given path is absolute and normalized. Additionally, the code should check that the accessed directories and files have the appropriate access permissions.
