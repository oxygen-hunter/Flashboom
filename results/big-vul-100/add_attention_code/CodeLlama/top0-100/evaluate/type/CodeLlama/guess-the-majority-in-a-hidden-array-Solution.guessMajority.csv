The vulnerability arises from the use of the `guessMajority` function, which takes an `ArrayReader` object as input and returns the index of the majority element in the array. The function uses a naive approach to determine the majority element, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input array is maliciously crafted.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the line length. This means that if the image data is corrupted or malicious, it can cause the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the stream, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an exploitable crash or code execution.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted PDF file that contains a malicious image with a large number of pixels. The malicious image can be crafted to cause the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the stream, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an exploitable crash or code execution.

To fix the vulnerability, the `ImageStream` class should be modified to perform bounds checking on the line length, or a separate bounds checking function should be added to the `ImageStream` class.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the FT_Load_Glyph function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input glyph index is too large. The function takes an FT_UInt as input, which is an unsigned integer type. However, the function does not perform any bounds checking on the input value, which means that an attacker can potentially overflow the buffer by providing a large value for the glyph index.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large glyph index value. When the PDF file is processed by the application, the FT_Load_Glyph function will attempt to load the glyph with the specified index, which can cause a buffer overflow. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability, as the application may crash or become unresponsive.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `guessMajority` function uses the `reader` object to query the values of the array elements, but it does not properly handle the case where the `reader` object is not initialized. Specifically, the function assumes that the `reader` object is always initialized, but it is not guaranteed that the `reader` object is initialized before it is used.

Therefore, if the `reader` object is not initialized, the function will access uninitialized memory, which can lead to a nan vulnerability. This is because the `reader` object is not properly initialized, and the function does not properly handle the case where the `reader` object is not initialized.

To fix this vulnerability, the `guessMajority` function should properly check whether the `reader` object is initialized before using it. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the `reader` object is not null before using it.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

The function then iterates over the array and checks if the values are equal to a specific value. However, the function does not perform any bounds checking on the array, which means that it can read out of bounds and access memory that is not part of the array. This can lead to a buffer overflow attack, which can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check the length of the array before accessing its elements. The function assumes that the array has at least 4 elements, but it does not check if the array has more elements. This means that the function can read out of bounds and access memory that is not part of the array.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can provide an array with more than 4 elements and then manipulate the values of the array to cause a buffer overflow. The attacker can then use the buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code or cause the program to crash.

The vulnerability is fixed by adding bounds checking to the function. The function should check the length of the array before accessing its elements, and it should not access elements that are out of bounds.

To fix the vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly handle the case where the input array has more than 4 elements.

Additionally, the function also uses the BN_mod_exp function, which can also lead to a buffer overflow if the input is too large.

The vulnerability is due to the use of untrusted user input without proper validation and sanitation. The input is used directly without any bounds checking, which can lead to buffer overflows if the input is too large.

The recommended solution is to properly validate and sanitize the user input before using it in the BN_bntest_rand function. Additionally, the BN_mod_exp function should also be used with proper bounds checking to prevent buffer overflows.","The code contains a +Info vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input value is too large.

If the input value is too large, the function will return a value that is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input value, but rather a value that is too large to be represented by the integer type. This can cause the loop to run indefinitely, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted input that causes the `splashFloor` function to return a value that is too large, leading to an infinite loop. This can cause the application to crash or become unresponsive, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.

The move_uploaded_file implementation in ext/standard/basic_functions.c in PHP before 5.4.39, 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 truncates a pathname upon encountering a \x00 character, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended extension restrictions and create files with unexpected names via a crafted second argument.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-7243.

177926,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code is a function that takes a GstTagList pointer, a base64-encoded image data string, and a base64-encoded image data length as input. It decodes the base64-encoded image data and then converts it to a GstBuffer object. Finally, it adds the GstBuffer object to the GstTagList object.

There is no direct execution of code in the given code. The code only manipulates memory and performs operations on the GstBuffer object. Therefore, there is no vulnerability to Exec Code Overflow.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0586. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.
Vulnerability summary:
Integer overflow in the gst_vorbis_tag_add_coverart function (gst-libs/gst/tag/gstvorbistag.c) in vorbistag in gst-plugins-base (aka gstreamer-plugins-base) before 0.10.23 in GStreamer allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted COVERART tag that is converted from a base64 representation, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.

177927,,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a nan vulnerability. The code is a PHP function that implements the OpenSSL sealing algorithm, and it does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to nan.","The code contains a nan vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2017-11144. The CWE-ID is CWE-754.
Vulnerability summary:
In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, the openssl extension PEM sealing code did not check the return value of the OpenSSL sealing function, which could lead to a crash of the PHP interpreter, related to an interpretation conflict for a negative number in ext/openssl/openssl.c, and an OpenSSL documentation omission.
