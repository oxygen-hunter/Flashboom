The vulnerability arises from the use of the `cairo_mask` function, which takes a pattern as an argument. The pattern is created from the `maskImage` surface, which is created from the `maskBuffer` buffer. The `maskBuffer` buffer is created by copying the `maskImgStr` stream into it, which can potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the stream is too large.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large mask image, which can cause the application to allocate a large amount of memory and eventually crash. This can be done by sending a PDF file with a large number of pages, each with a large mask image. The attacker can also use a specially crafted PDF file to cause a buffer overflow by sending a large amount of data to the `maskImgStr` stream.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should limit the size of the `maskBuffer` buffer and ensure that it is properly bounded. Additionally, the application should validate the input data to prevent buffer overflows.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177787,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer size of 4096 bytes, which can be overflowed by a crafted PDF file. If the image data exceeds this buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the `imgData.imgStr->reset()` function, which resets the `ImageStream` object to its initial state. However, this function does not check the buffer size before resetting it, which can cause a buffer overflow if the image data exceeds the buffer size.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a PDF file with a large image data stream, which can overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, as well as an execution of arbitrary code.

Therefore, it is recommended to update the `ImageStream` class to check the buffer size before resetting it, to prevent buffer overflows and ensure the security of the application.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer overflow vulnerability, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is caused by the `ImageStream::getNext` method, which reads data from the stream into a buffer, but does not check the buffer size before writing to it. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large image, which will cause the `ImageStream` class to read data from the stream into a buffer that is too small, leading to a buffer overflow. The attacker can then use the buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to a denial of service or other security vulnerabilities.

To fix the vulnerability, the `ImageStream` class should be modified to check the buffer size before writing to it, or a separate buffer should be used to store the image data. Additionally, the `ImageStream` class should be updated to use a secure allocation function to","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177793,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_Load_Glyph` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input glyph index is too large. The function takes an `FT_UInt` parameter, which is an unsigned integer type, and the input glyph index is converted to this type before being passed to the function. However, if the input glyph index is too large, it will be converted to a value that is outside the range of the `FT_UInt` type, causing a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large glyph index, which can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, as the application may become unavailable to users.

To fix the vulnerability, the `FT_Load_Glyph` function should be modified to check the input glyph index for overflow before passing it to the function. Alternatively, the `FT_UInt` type should be replaced with a larger integer type, such as `FT_Long`, to prevent buffer overflows.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177906,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input number is too large.

If the input number is too large, the function will return a value that is not within the valid range of the `int` type, leading to a buffer overflow. This can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted input that causes the `splashFloor` function to return a value that is outside the valid range of the `int` type. This can be done by sending a large floating-point number as input, which will cause the function to return a value that is too large to fit in the `int` type.

The vulnerability can be mitigated by checking for overflows in the `splashFloor` function, or by using a safer function that does not have","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The code does not contain any obvious buffer overflow vulnerabilities, and the input validation is not weak. However, the code does contain some potential security vulnerabilities, such as integer overflows, use after free, and memory leaks.

Integer overflows can occur if the input values are too large, leading to incorrect calculations and buffer miscalculations. Use after free vulnerabilities can occur if the memory is deallocated but still being used, leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution. Memory leaks can occur if the memory is not properly freed, leading to performance degradation or DoS vulnerabilities.

However, the code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to these issues. The input validation is not weak, and the code does not contain any obvious buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

The code is a function that takes two vectors as input, `lamps` and `queries`, and performs some operations on them. It does not appear to have any vulnerabilities related to Exec Code Overflow.

However, the code does have some potential issues related to buffer overflows, use after free, and other security vulnerabilities. For example, the code uses `unordered_set` and `unordered_map` to store data, which can lead to buffer overflows if the data is not properly validated. Additionally, the code uses `tie` to extract values from a pair, which can lead to use after free if the pair is not properly initialized.
