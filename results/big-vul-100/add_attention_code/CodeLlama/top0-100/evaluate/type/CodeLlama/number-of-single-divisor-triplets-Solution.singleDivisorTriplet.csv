177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The function uses a hardcoded list of GUIDs to check for specific user account control flags, but it does not properly check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended access restrictions and create machine accounts with the desired user account control flags.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted request to the function, which would allow an attacker to create machine accounts with the desired user account control flags. This could potentially be used to bypass intended access restrictions and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gmalloc` function, which allocates memory using the `malloc` function. If the `malloc` function fails to allocate memory, it returns a null pointer, which is then used as an argument to the `gfree` function. This can cause a null pointer dereference, leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large number of objects, each with a large number of bytes. The `gmalloc` function will be called repeatedly, leading to a large number of memory allocations. If the `malloc` function fails to allocate memory, the `gfree` function will be called with a null pointer, leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `gmalloc` function should be modified to check for null pointers before passing them to the `gfree` function. Additionally, the `gfree` function should be modified to check for null pointers before freeing memory.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the number of bytes read. This means that if the image data is corrupted or malicious, it can cause the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the stream, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an exploitable crash or code execution.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the code. The function `drawMaskedImage` takes in a `maskWidth` and `maskHeight` as input, and then uses these values to allocate memory for a `SplashBitmap` object. However, the code does not perform any bounds checking on these values, which can lead to integer overflows if the values are too large.

For example, if `maskWidth` is set to a very large value, the code will allocate a large amount of memory for the `SplashBitmap` object, which can lead to a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code. Similarly, if `maskHeight` is set to a very large value, the code will allocate a large amount of memory for the `SplashBitmap` object, which can also lead to a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that the values passed to `drawMaskedImage` are properly validated and sanitized to prevent integer overflows and other vulnerabilities.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177788,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the ImageStream class, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input stream contains a crafted PDF file. The ImageStream class uses a fixed-size buffer to read data from the input stream, and if the buffer is not large enough to hold the entire image, it can cause a buffer overflow. This can lead to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
imgData.imgStr = new ImageStream(str, width,
                                colorMap->getNumPixelComps(),
                                colorMap->getBits());
```
The ImageStream class uses the width, height, and bits parameters to determine the size of the buffer to be allocated. However, these parameters are not properly validated, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input stream contains a crafted PDF file.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a crafted PDF file that contains a large image with a small width and height, and a large number of bits per pixel. This can cause the ImageStream class","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177792,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the calculation of the rowSize variable. The rowSize variable is calculated as follows:

rowSize = (width + 7) >> 3;

This calculation can overflow if the width variable is large enough. For example, if width is 2^31 - 1, the calculation will result in a value of 2^31 - 1 + 7 = 2^31, which is greater than the maximum value that can be stored in an integer.

Furthermore, the rowSize variable is then multiplied by the height variable, which can also cause an overflow if the height variable is large enough.

Therefore, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a large value for the width or height variable, which can cause the rowSize variable to overflow and result in a buffer overflow. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) or potentially execute arbitrary code.

The code is vulnerable to this type of attack because it does not perform proper bounds checking on the width and height variables, and it does not use a safe integer type for","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the FT_Load_Glyph function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input glyph index is too large. The function takes an FT_UInt as input, which is an unsigned integer type. However, the function does not perform any bounds checking on the input value, which means that an attacker can potentially overflow the buffer by providing a large value for the glyph index.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a crafted PDF file that contains a large glyph index value. The attacker could then use this value to overflow the buffer and cause a crash or execute arbitrary code.

It is important to note that this vulnerability is not limited to the given code snippet, but rather it is a general issue with the FT_Load_Glyph function.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `atof` function to convert the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute to a double value. If the attribute is not present or is not a valid double value, the `atof` function returns a NaN value. This value is then used to initialize the `m_refreshDelayFactor` member variable, which is then used in a calculation.

The calculation is vulnerable to a nan vulnerability because the `m_refreshDelayFactor` variable is not properly validated before being used in the calculation. If the `m_refreshDelayFactor` variable contains a NaN value, the calculation will produce an incorrect result.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly validate the `m_refreshDelayFactor` variable before using it in the calculation.

The code is a function that takes in a string and a charset, and returns the next codepoint in the string. It uses the smb_iconv_handle structure to perform the conversion. The function checks if the first character in the string is a valid codepoint, and if it is, it returns the codepoint. If the first character is not a valid codepoint, it uses the smb_iconv function to convert the string to UTF16 format, and then checks if the resulting codepoint is valid. If it is, it returns the codepoint. If it is not, it returns an invalid codepoint.

The function does not appear to have any vulnerabilities related to buffer overflow, use after free, memory leaks, integer overflow/underflow, null pointer dereference, improper input validation, race conditions, insecure function usage, insecure resource management, or improper error handling.

However, it is possible that the function could be vulnerable to a security vulnerability related to cryptographic issues or sensitive data exposure, but without more information about the context in which the function is being used, it is difficult to determine whether this is the case.","The code contains a +Info vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `datum_to_json` function does not properly handle the `key_scalar` parameter, which is used to determine whether the input value is a scalar or not. If the input value is a scalar, the function does not properly escape it, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

177855,Bypass,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-5252. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code allows a symlink to point outside of a share, which can bypass intended file-access restrictions. This can be exploited by creating a symlink that points to a file outside of the share, and then accessing the symlink. The code does not properly check the path of the symlink, which allows an attacker to access files outside of the share.

This vulnerability is similar to the one described in CVE-2015-5252, which affects Samba 3.x and 4.x before 4.1.22, 4.2.x before 4.2.7, and 4.3.x before 4.3.3.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

",3.0,810.0,6.0,2.9756526947021484
177856,,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `singleDivisorTriplet` takes a vector of integers as input, and then iterates over the unique elements in the vector to find the number of triplets that sum to zero. The function uses a naive approach to find the triplets, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input vector is large enough.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `check` function, which takes three integers as input and returns `true` if the sum of the three integers is zero. The function does not perform any bounds checking on the input integers, which means that it can read beyond the end of the input vector if the input vector is large enough. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a specially crafted input vector that contains a large number of integers. The attacker would need to ensure that the sum of the integers in the vector is zero, which can be done by carefully selecting the integers in the vector. Once the attacker has crafted the input vector, they can use it to execute arbitrary code by exploiting the buffer overflow.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The `splashFloor` function is used to round the `lineDashStartPhase` value down to the nearest integer.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_READ_USHORT()` function, which reads a 16-bit value from the input stream. If the value is greater than 65535, it will overflow and wrap around to a negative value. This can lead to an integer overflow in the `glyph_sid` variable, which is then used as an index into the `sids` array.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input that causes the `glyph_sid` variable to overflow. This can be done by sending a large value for the `offset` parameter, which will cause the `FT_READ_USHORT()` function to read a value that is greater than 65535.

177926,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code is a function that takes a vector of integers as input and returns the number of triplets of integers that can be formed by summing up to 6. The function uses a hash map to count the frequency of each integer in the input vector. It then iterates over the unique integers in the input vector and checks if there are any triplets that sum up to 6. If there are, it returns the number of triplets.

The function does not involve any user input or external data, and it does not execute any code that can be controlled by the user. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0586. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.
Vulnerability summary:
Integer overflow in the gst_vorbis_tag_add_coverart function (gst-libs/gst/tag/gstvorbistag.c) in vorbistag in gst-plugins-base (aka gstreamer-plugins-base) before 0.10.23 in GStreamer allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted COVERART tag that is converted from a base64 representation, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
