177783,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gmalloc` function, which allocates memory on the heap. If the memory allocation fails, the program will crash. However, the `gmalloc` function does not check for memory allocation failures, and the program will continue to execute even if the allocation fails. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability, as the program will crash and exit, potentially taking down the entire system.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a crafted PDF file with a large number of images, each with a large number of pixels. The `gmalloc` function will be called repeatedly, leading to a large number of memory allocations. If the memory allocation fails, the program will crash, potentially taking down the entire system.

To fix this vulnerability, the `gmalloc` function should be modified to check for memory allocation failures and handle them appropriately. This can be done by using the `malloc` function instead of `gmalloc`, or by implementing a custom memory allocation function that checks for memory allocation failures.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream and returns it as a `SplashColorPtr`. The `SplashColorPtr` is then used to draw the image on the screen.

The vulnerability occurs when the `ImageStream` class is used to read a large image file, which can cause the `getLine` method to read more data from the stream than it is designed to handle. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted PDF file to the application, which contains a large image that is designed to cause a buffer overflow. The attacker would then need to trick the application into reading the large image file, which would cause the buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `ImageStream` class should be modified to ensure that it does not read more data","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer size of 4096 bytes, which can be overflowed by a crafted PDF file. If the image data exceeds this buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the `drawMaskedImage` function, which takes a `Stream` object as an argument and uses it to read image data. The `drawMaskedImage` function does not perform any bounds checking on the `Stream` object, which allows an attacker to overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to craft a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large image with a malicious payload. The payload would need to be placed in the image data, which would cause the buffer overflow when the `ImageStream` object is used to read the image data.

The fix for this vulnerability is to perform bounds checking on the `Stream` object and ensure that the image data does not exceed","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer size of 4096 bytes, which can be overflowed by a crafted PDF file. If the image data exceeds this buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the `imgMaskData.imgStr->reset()` function, which resets the `ImageStream` object to its initial state. However, this function does not check if the buffer size has been exceeded, and it does not reset the buffer size to its initial value. This means that if the image data exceeds the buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to craft a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large image with a high resolution. The image data can be crafted to exceed the buffer size of the `ImageStream` object, causing a buffer overflow and potentially executing arbitrary code.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ceil` function to calculate the `cairo_width` and `cairo_height` variables. If the `scale` parameter is set to a large value, the `cairo_width` and `cairo_height` variables can become very large, leading to an integer overflow. This can cause the `cairo_rowstride` variable to become too large, leading to a buffer overflow when the `cairo_data` array is allocated.

Additionally, the `memset` function is used to initialize the `cairo_data` array with a specific value. If the `transparent` parameter is set to `true`, the `cairo_data` array is initialized with all zeros, which can lead to a potential buffer overflow if the `cairo_height` variable is set to a large value.

177887,DoS Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-3228. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `gs_heap_alloc_bytes` function takes an `uint` argument `size` and uses it to calculate the size of the memory block to be allocated. However, the calculation is done using the `+` operator, which can cause integer overflow if the `size` value is too large. This can lead to the allocation of a much larger memory block than intended, potentially causing a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a crafted Postscript (ps) file to the `gs_heap_alloc_bytes` function with a large `size` value, causing the function to allocate a much larger memory block than intended. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other memory corruption, potentially causing the application to crash or behave unexpectedly.

177893,+Info,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The function takes an unbounded amount of input from the user, and then uses a series of string and memory functions to manipulate the input. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a long input string that is longer than the buffer size. Once the input is processed, the buffer overflow would occur, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is related to the use of the `strcpy` function, which can be used to copy a string into a buffer. If the input string is longer than the buffer size, the `strcpy` function will overwrite the buffer, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.

Additionally, the code also uses the `sprintf` function, which can also be used to format a string into a buffer. If the input string is longer than the buffer size, the `sprintf` function will also overwrite the buffer, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should use bounded buffer sizes and validate user input to ensure that it is within the bounds of the buffer. Additionally, the code should use safer string manipulation functions, such as `strncpy` and `snprintf`, to prevent buffer overflows.","The code contains a +Info vulnerability.

The function takes a filename as an argument and uses it to create a parser context, which can potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the filename is too long. Additionally, the function does not perform any bounds checking on the filename, which can also lead to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability is due to the use of the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` function, which takes a filename as an argument and creates a parser context. The filename is not validated, and the function does not perform any bounds checking on the filename. This means that if the filename is too long, it can potentially overflow the buffer allocated for the filename, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can provide a long filename that exceeds the buffer size allocated for the filename. This can cause the parser to read data from the buffer beyond the end of the filename, leading to a buffer overflow. The attacker can then use this data to execute arbitrary code, leading to a denial-of-service or remote code execution vulnerability.

The recommended solution is to validate the filename and perform bounds checking on it to prevent buffer overflows.

Therefore, it is recommended to use proper bounds checking and error handling mechanisms to prevent such vulnerabilities.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177917,Exec Code,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `XGetFontPath` allocates memory for a list of font paths using `Xmalloc`, and then reads a list of font paths from the server using `_XReadPad`. The list of font paths is unpacked into null-terminated strings, and the function does not perform any bounds checking on the length of the strings. This means that if the list of font paths is longer than the allocated memory, the function will write beyond the end of the allocated memory, leading to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not properly check the length of the list of font paths before reading it from the server. This allows an attacker to send a specially crafted request to the server that causes the function to write beyond the end of the allocated memory, leading to a buffer overflow.

177919,,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `XListFonts` takes a pattern as an input, which can be a malicious string that is longer than the maximum allowed length. If the pattern is longer than the maximum allowed length, it can cause a buffer overflow, leading to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check the length of the pattern before allocating memory for it. It assumes that the pattern is a null-terminated string, which is not always the case. The function should have checked the length of the pattern before allocating memory for it, and should have used a bounded buffer to prevent buffer overflows.

177922,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strcpy` function, which can copy more characters than the destination buffer can hold. This can lead to an overflow, which can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the `strcpy` function, which can copy more characters than the destination buffer can hold. This can lead to an overflow, which can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

The code is vulnerable because it does not check the size of the destination buffer before copying data into it. This means that the `strcpy` function can copy more characters than the buffer can hold, leading to an overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the size of the destination buffer before copying data into it. This can be done by using the `strlen` function to determine the size of the destination buffer, and then using the `strncpy` function to copy data into the buffer, making sure to only copy the number of characters that fit in the buffer.

Additionally, the code should also check for null pointers before dereferencing them, as this can also lead to a buffer overflow.

It is also recommended to use safer alternatives like `strncpy` and `strlcpy` to mitigate risks of buffer overflows and other vulnerabilities.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
