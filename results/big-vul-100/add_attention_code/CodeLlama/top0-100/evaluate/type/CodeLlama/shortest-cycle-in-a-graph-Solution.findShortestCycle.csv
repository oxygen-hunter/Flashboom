177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are required to set the UF_DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWD, UF_ENCRYPTED_TEXT_PASSWORD_ALLOWED, UF_SERVER_TRUST_ACCOUNT, UF_PARTIAL_SECRETS_ACCOUNT, and UF_INTERDOMAIN_TRUST_ACCOUNT bits in the userAccountControl attribute.

The function does not properly check for the presence of these rights, which allows an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions and create machine accounts with the required rights.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a malicious image that has a large width and height, and a malicious color map that has a large number of pixel components. The malicious color map can cause the `getRGBLine` function to write to an unintended location in memory, potentially leading to a buffer overflow and code execution.

This can lead to a buffer overflow when the program attempts to write to the null pointer, resulting in an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large number of objects, causing the program to allocate a large amount of memory on the heap. If the memory allocation fails, the program will crash, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.

To fix the vulnerability, the `gmalloc` function should be modified to check for memory allocation failures and return an error code if the allocation fails. The program should also be designed to handle memory allocation failures gracefully, such as by returning an error code or terminating the program.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `drawImage` function, which takes a `width` and `height` parameter and uses them to allocate memory for the image data. If the `width` or `height` parameter is not validated properly, it can lead to a buffer overflow or other security vulnerabilities.

For example, if the `width` or `height` parameter is set to a very large value, it can cause the `imgData.lookup` array to be allocated with a large size, leading to a buffer overflow. Additionally, if the `colorMap` parameter is not properly validated, it can lead to a use-after-free error, where the `imgData.lookup` array is used after it has been deallocated.

Furthermore, the `drawImage` function also uses the `mat` parameter to perform a matrix transformation on the image data, which can also lead to security vulnerabilities if the `mat` parameter is not properly validated.

Therefore, it is important to properly validate all user input and ensure that all memory allocations are properly bounded to prevent security vulnerabilities.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses the ImageStream class to read the image data from the input stream. The ImageStream class uses a buffer to store the image data, and the buffer size is determined by the maximum image size. If the image size exceeds the buffer size, the code will read the image data into the buffer, and then process it. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the image data exceeds the buffer size.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large image size, which will cause the buffer to overflow and the application to crash. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, as the application will be unavailable to process other requests.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should use a safer image processing library that does not rely on fixed-size buffers. Alternatively, the code can use a dynamic buffer size that is determined at runtime, based on the image size. This will ensure that the buffer size is large enough to hold the image data, without overflowing.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The code is a function that takes in a string and a charset, and returns the next codepoint in the string. It uses the smb_iconv_handle to convert the string to UTF16 format, and then reads the first two bytes of the converted string to get the codepoint.

The code does not appear to have any vulnerabilities related to buffer overflow, use after free, memory leaks, integer overflow/underflow, null pointer dereference, improper input validation, race conditions, insecure function usage, insecure resource management, or improper error handling.

However, the code does have a potential vulnerability related to cryptographic issues. The code uses the smb_iconv_handle to convert the string to UTF16 format, which could potentially be vulnerable to cryptographic issues if the conversion is not done correctly.

Additionally, the code does not appear to have any vulnerabilities related to sensitive data exposure, as it does not appear to be handling any sensitive data.

177850,DoS Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-5289. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly handle JSON values that are too large to fit in the available buffer. Specifically, the code uses the `appendStringInfoString` function to append a string to the `result` buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the string is too large.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted JSON value that is too large to fit in the available buffer. The `appendStringInfoString` function will then write the string to the buffer, potentially overflowing it and causing a buffer overflow. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability, as the server may crash or become unresponsive.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly handle JSON values that are too large to fit in the available buffer. One way to do this is to use the `appendStringInfo` function instead of `appendStringInfoString`, which allows for specifying a maximum buffer size. Alternatively, the code can use a fixed-size buffer and implement a mechanism to handle JSON values that are too large to fit in the available buffer.","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `findShortestCycle` function, which takes an integer `n` and a vector of vectors of integers `edges` as input. The function then performs a breadth-first search on the graph represented by `edges` to find the shortest cycle in the graph.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `emplace_back` function to add elements to the `adj` vector. This function can cause a buffer overflow if the vector is not properly resized beforehand. Specifically, if the `edges` vector is too large, the `adj` vector may not have enough space to store all the elements, leading to a buffer overflow.
