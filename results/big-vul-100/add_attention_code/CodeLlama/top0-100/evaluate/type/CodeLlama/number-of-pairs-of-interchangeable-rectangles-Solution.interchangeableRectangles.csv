The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the code. The function takes in a stream and a width and height, and then uses those values to calculate the number of bytes to read from the stream. However, the calculation is done using integer arithmetic, which can result in integer overflows if the values are too large.

For example, if the width and height are both 2^31 - 1, the calculation for the number of bytes to read would be 2^31 - 1 * 2^31 - 1 = 2^62 - 1, which is greater than the maximum value that can be represented by an integer. This would result in an integer overflow, which can lead to a crash or other unexpected behavior.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a crafted PDF file with a large width and height value, which would cause the integer overflow and crash the application. This could be done by sending a specially crafted PDF file to the application, or by using a specially crafted URL to trigger the vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gmalloc` function, which allocates memory for the `tmp_line` variable. The `gmalloc` function uses the `malloc` function to allocate memory, which can return a null pointer if the allocation fails.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the code. The function takes in a stream and a width and height, and then uses those values to calculate the size of the image. However, the code does not properly check for integer overflows, which can lead to a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

For example, if the width and height are both very large, the calculation `width * height` can overflow and result in a negative value. This can cause the `imgData.imgStr` to be allocated with a negative size, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially executing arbitrary code.

Additionally, the code also uses the `gcd` function to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers. However, the `gcd` function is not properly bounds-checked, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input values are large enough.

Therefore, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability, and it is recommended to fix the integer overflows and bounds-check the input values to prevent potential buffer overflows and arbitrary code execution.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ceil` function to calculate the width and height of the output surface. If the input values are large enough, the `ceil` function can overflow, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an arbitrary code execution vulnerability.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the calculation of the rowSize variable. The rowSize variable is calculated as follows:

rowSize = (width + 7) >> 3;

This calculation can overflow if the width variable is large enough. For example, if width is 2^31 - 1, the calculation will result in a value of 2^31 - 1 + 7 = 2^31, which is greater than the maximum value that can be stored in an integer variable.

Similarly, the calculation of rowSize in the case of splashModeRGB8 and splashModeBGR8 can also overflow if the width variable is large enough.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large width value, which can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

The `gs_main_tempnames` function returns a string that contains the names of temporary files created by the Ghostscript interpreter. The `strcpy` function is used to copy this string into the `tempnames` buffer. However, the `strcpy` function does not perform any bounds checking, so it can copy more bytes than the buffer can hold.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashDist` function, which calculates the distance between two points. The function uses the `sqrt` function to calculate the distance, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the distance is too large. The buffer overflow can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input that causes the `splashDist` function to calculate a large distance between two points. This can be done by providing a large value for one of the points, which will cause the `sqrt` function to overflow. Once the overflow occurs, the program will crash or execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability can be mitigated by using a safe version of the `sqrt` function, such as the `sqrtl` function, which is available in the C standard library. Alternatively, the `splashDist` function can be modified to use a safe version of the `sqrt` function.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses the `gmalloc` and `gmallocn` functions to allocate memory, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the memory allocation fails. The `gmalloc` function allocates memory using the `malloc` function, which can return a null pointer if the allocation fails. The `gmallocn` function allocates memory using the `calloc` function, which can also return a null pointer if the allocation fails.

If the `gmalloc` or `gmallocn` functions return a null pointer, the code will attempt to access memory outside the allocated memory space, leading to a buffer overflow. This can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code, depending on the specific circumstances.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should check the return value of the `gmalloc` and `gmallocn` functions for null pointers before attempting to access the allocated memory. If a null pointer is returned, the code should handle the error appropriately, such as by returning an error code or terminating the application.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_READ_USHORT()` function, which reads a 16-bit value from the input stream. If the value is greater than 65535, it will overflow and wrap around to a negative value. This can lead to an integer overflow in the `glyph_sid` variable, which is used to index into the `sids` array.

The `sids` array is allocated with `FT_NEW_ARRAY()`, which allocates memory for an array of `num_glyphs` elements. If `num_glyphs` is greater than 65535, the `sids` array will be allocated with a size of 65535 elements, which may not be enough to store all the glyphs in the font.
