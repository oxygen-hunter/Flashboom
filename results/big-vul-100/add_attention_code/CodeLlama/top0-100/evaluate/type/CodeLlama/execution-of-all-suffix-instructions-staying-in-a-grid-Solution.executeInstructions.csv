The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The function uses a hardcoded list of GUIDs to check for specific user account control flags, but it does not properly check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended access restrictions and create machine accounts with the desired user account control flags.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted request to the function, which would allow an attacker to create machine accounts with the desired user account control flags.

The code is using the `estrdup` function to allocate memory for the `strbuf` variable, which is a buffer that is used to store the time string. The `estrdup` function is a wrapper around the `malloc` function, which allocates memory from the heap. The memory allocated by `estrdup` is not freed until the `strbuf` variable goes out of scope, which is when the function returns.

Therefore, there is no memory leak in the code.

Additionally, the code is not using any deprecated or insecure functions, such as `strcpy`, `gets`, or `scanf`. It is using the `snprintf` function to format the time string, which is a safer alternative to `sprintf`.

177741,DoS Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a DoS Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2011-4128. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `gnutls_session_get_data` function does not perform any bounds checking on the `session_data` parameter, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input data is too large. The function assumes that the input data is of a fixed size, but it does not check if the input data is actually of that size. This can cause the function to write beyond the end of the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a large input data to the `gnutls_session_get_data` function, which can cause the function to write beyond the end of the allocated buffer and overwrite other parts of the program's memory. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability, as the program may crash or behave unexpectedly.

To fix the vulnerability, the function should perform proper bounds checking on the `session_data` parameter to ensure that it is of the expected size. This can be done by using a technique such as the ""boundscheck"" function from the ""check"" library.","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

177783,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gmalloc` function, which allocates memory on the heap. If the memory allocation fails, the program will crash. However, the `gmalloc` function does not check for memory allocation failures, and the program will continue to execute with a null pointer. This can lead to a buffer overflow when the program attempts to write to the null pointer, resulting in a crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large number of pixels, causing the program to allocate a large amount of memory on the heap. If the memory allocation fails, the program will crash, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.

To fix the vulnerability, the `gmalloc` function should be modified to check for memory allocation failures and return an error code if the allocation fails. The program should also be designed to handle memory allocation failures gracefully, such as by returning an error code or terminating the program.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer of a fixed size, and if the image data exceeds this buffer, it can cause a buffer overflow. This can lead to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large image that exceeds the buffer size of the `ImageStream` class. The attacker can then cause the application to read beyond the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. This can be done by sending a malicious PDF file with a large image that exceeds the buffer size of the `ImageStream` class.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `ImageStream` class should be modified to use a dynamic buffer size, or the buffer size should be increased to a reasonable limit. Additionally, the application should be designed to handle buffer overflows and other security vulnerabilities.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ceil` function to calculate the size of the `cairo_data` buffer. If the `scale` parameter is set to a large value, the `cairo_width` and `cairo_height` variables can become very large, leading to integer overflows. This can cause the `cairo_rowstride` variable to become too large, leading to a buffer overflow when the `cairo_data` buffer is allocated.

Additionally, the `memset` function is used to initialize the `cairo_data` buffer with a specific value. If the `transparent` parameter is set to `true`, the buffer is initialized with the value `0x00`, which can cause the buffer to be filled with zeros. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability if the buffer is used to store sensitive data, as the data will be lost.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the FT_Load_Glyph function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input string is too long. The function takes a variable number of arguments, and the size of the buffer allocated for the input string is not properly checked. This can lead to an attacker sending a crafted PDF file that causes the function to write beyond the end of the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `atof` function to convert the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute value to a double. If the attribute value is not a valid double, the `atof` function will return a NaN value, which will be assigned to `m_refreshDelayFactor`. This will cause the `m_refreshDelayFactor` to be set to NaN, which will lead to incorrect behavior in the program.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted XML file to the program, which contains a `refreshDelayFactor` attribute with a value that is not a valid double. The program will then use the NaN value to set `m_refreshDelayFactor`, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the vulnerability, the code should properly validate the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute value before using it to set `m_refreshDelayFactor`. This can be done by using a regular expression to validate the attribute value, or by using a more robust parsing mechanism to ensure that the attribute value is a valid double.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

The function takes an integer `n` as input, and then uses it in a calculation to determine the size of the output vector. However, the calculation does not perform any bounds checking, which means that if the input `n` is large enough, it can cause an integer overflow and lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability is in the line `result[j] = min(result[j], i - j);`, where `j` is an index into the output vector `result`. If `j` is close to `n`, then `i - j` can become very large, causing an integer overflow. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the program crashing or producing incorrect results.

To fix the vulnerability, the code should perform bounds checking on `j` to ensure that it is within the valid range of indices for the output vector. This can be done by adding a check such as `if (j < 0 || j >= n) { continue; }` before the line `result[j] = min(result[j], i - j);`. This check will ensure that the program does not attempt to access elements outside the valid range of the output vector, which can help prevent the integer overflow vulnerability.","The code contains a Overflow vulnerability.

The function `executeInstructions` takes a string `s` as input, and uses a `unordered_map` to store the indices of the characters in the string. The map is initialized with the values of `x0` and `y0`, which are the coordinates of the starting point of the robot. The function then iterates over the characters in the string, and for each character, it checks if the corresponding index is already present in the map. If it is, it updates the value of the index to the minimum of the current value and the current index.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the map is not properly initialized. The map is initialized with the values of `x0` and `y0`, but these values are not necessarily valid indices in the string. If the string is empty, or if the starting point of the robot is not at the beginning of the string, then the map will contain invalid indices, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can provide a string with a large number of characters, and then provide a starting point that is not at the beginning of the string.

The code is a function that takes two gs_gstate pointers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the page devices of the two states are different. It does not appear to contain any code that could be used to execute arbitrary code.

However, the function does use the `obj_eq` function to compare the page device dictionaries of the two states, which could potentially lead to a vulnerability if the `obj_eq` function is not properly validated. If the `obj_eq` function is not properly validated, it could be used to compare two objects that are not equal, leading to incorrect results.

Additionally, the function uses the `gs_currentdevice` function to get the current device for each state, which could potentially lead to a vulnerability if the `gs_currentdevice` function is not properly validated. If the `gs_currentdevice` function is not properly validated, it could be used to get the current device for a state that is not the current state, leading to incorrect results.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses the `fdctrl_read_data` function to read data from the floppy disk controller. The function reads data from the floppy disk controller's FIFO buffer, which can be overflowed if the data is not properly validated. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted command to the floppy disk controller, which can cause the FIFO buffer to overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:

The `fdctrl->fifo` array is used to store data read from the floppy disk controller's FIFO buffer. The `pos` variable is used to index into the array, and the `retval` variable is used to store the value at that index. However, the code does not properly validate the `pos` variable, which can cause the program to read data from an invalid index in the `fdctrl->fifo` array.

177923,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-2348. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `move_uploaded_file` function truncates a pathname upon encountering a null character (`\x00`) in the second argument. This allows an attacker to bypass intended extension restrictions and create files with unexpected names.

For example, if the second argument is `test.txt\x00.jpg`, the function will only move the file `test.txt` to `test.jpg`, which is not the intended behavior.

This vulnerability is similar to the one described in CVE-2006-7243, but it is not the same. The fix for CVE-2006-7243 was incomplete, and this vulnerability is a result of that.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

Vulnerability summary:
The move_uploaded_file implementation in ext/standard/basic_functions.c in PHP before 5.4.39, 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 truncates a pathname upon encountering a \x00 character, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended extension restrictions and create files with unexpected names via a crafted second argument.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-7243.

177926,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The function `executeInstructions` takes in a vector of integers `startPos` and a string `s` as input, and returns a vector of integers of the same length as `s`. The function uses a static map `directions` to map each character in `s` to a pair of integers representing the direction of movement in the x and y directions. The function then uses a loop to iterate over each character in `s` and update the values in the `result` vector accordingly.

The function does not appear to have any vulnerabilities related to Exec Code Overflow, as it does not execute any code based on user input. The only user input that is used in the function is the `startPos` vector, which is used to initialize the values in the `result` vector. The `result` vector is then returned to the caller, and the function does not execute any code based on the values in the `result` vector.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177927,,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function takes a string as input and copies it into a buffer without checking the size of the input. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is too large. The vulnerability is in the line `buf = emalloc(data_len + EVP_CIPHER_CTX_block_size(ctx));`. The `data_len` variable is not properly bounded, and the `EVP_CIPHER_CTX_block_size(ctx)` function returns the block size of the cipher, which can be large. This means that the buffer allocated by the `emalloc` function is too small to hold the input string, leading to a buffer overflow.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.
