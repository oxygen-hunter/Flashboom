177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The function uses a hardcoded list of GUIDs to check for the presence of specific userAccountControl bits, but it does not properly check for the presence of the required rights to set these bits. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended access restrictions and create machine accounts with the desired userAccountControl bits set.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC. The attacker can then use the hardcoded list of GUIDs to set the desired userAccountControl bits on a machine account, even if the attacker does not have the required rights to do so. This can lead to a bypass of intended access restrictions and potentially allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the domain.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `fz_try` macro, which catches all exceptions and rethrows them as `FZ_ERROR_TRYLATER`. However, the `fz_rethrow_if` function is used to check if the exception is `FZ_ERROR_TRYLATER`, and if so, it ignores the error and continues execution. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by repeatedly triggering the `FZ_ERROR_TRYLATER` error.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted PDF file to the application, which would cause the `fz_rethrow_if` function to repeatedly ignore the `FZ_ERROR_TRYLATER` error.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `drawImage` function, which takes a `width` and `height` parameter, and then uses these values to allocate memory for the image data. However, the function does not perform any bounds checking on these values, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the values are too large. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a maliciously crafted PDF file with a large `width` and `height` value, causing the program to allocate a large amount of memory and potentially crashing the application.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses the `ImageStream` class to read the image data from the input stream, and then passes the data to the `drawImage` function without properly validating it. The `drawImage` function then uses the data to draw the image on the screen, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the data is not properly validated.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ceil` function, which can cause an integer overflow if the input value is too large. The `ceil` function is used to calculate the width and height of the output surface, and the resulting values are then used to create a new surface using the `cairo_image_surface_create_for_data` function. If the input values are too large, the resulting surface may be too large to be allocated on the stack, leading to a stack overflow.

Additionally, the `memset` function is used to initialize the data buffer for the surface, which can also cause a stack overflow if the input values are too large.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the input values should be validated to ensure that they are within a reasonable range. Additionally, the `ceil` function should be replaced with a safer alternative, such as the `round` function, which can handle larger input values without causing an integer overflow.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177792,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a DoS Exec Code Overflow.

The code is a C++ function that takes in a vector of vectors of integers as an argument and returns the maximum sum of three integers in the vector. The function uses a combination of loops and conditional statements to achieve this.

There are no obvious vulnerabilities in the code that could lead to a DoS Exec Code Overflow. The function does not use any user-supplied input, and it does not have any known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker.

However, it is important to note that the code may have other vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker. For example, the function uses a static array to store the maximum sum of three integers, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the input vector is too large. Additionally, the function does not check for null pointers or other potential errors, which could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

Overall, while the code is not vulnerable to a DoS Exec Code Overflow, it is important to carefully review the code to ensure that it is secure and does not have any other vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177899,+Info,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to any security vulnerabilities.

The code is a C++ function that parses an XML file using the libxml2 library. It does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, or memory leaks.

However, it is important to note that the code is using the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` function, which can be vulnerable to XXE attacks if the XML file being parsed contains an XML external entity declaration. This is because the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` function does not perform any validation on the XML file, and it can be exploited by an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should use the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxtWithData` function instead, which takes an additional `data` parameter that can be used to specify a custom entity loader. This can be used to load the XML file in a secure manner, without allowing the possibility of an XXE attack.","The code contains a +Info vulnerability.

177906,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses the `splashFloor` function to calculate the index of the line dash pattern, which can lead to an integer overflow if the phase is too large. This can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input that triggers the integer overflow. This can be done by providing a large value for the `lineDashStartPhase` parameter, which is then used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. If the value is too large, it can cause an integer overflow, leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

Therefore, it is important to fix this vulnerability by implementing proper bounds checking and error handling mechanisms to prevent integer overflows.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177909,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gets` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the user enters more characters than the buffer can hold. The `gets` function does not perform any bounds checking, and it does not ensure that the input is null-terminated. This can lead to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted input to the `gets` function, which can cause the buffer to overflow and write to memory outside the allocated bounds. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, potentially allowing the attacker to gain control of the system or steal sensitive data.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `gets` function should be avoided in favor of safer alternatives like `fgets` or `scanf`. Additionally, input validation should be implemented to ensure that user input is properly sanitized and does not exceed the bounds of the buffer.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `long long` type to store the result of the `maximumValueSum` function, which can overflow if the sum of the values exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by a `long long`. This can happen if the `board` vector is large enough, and the values in the `board` vector are large enough, such that the sum of the values exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by a `long long`.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to provide a specially crafted `board` vector that causes the sum of the values to exceed the maximum value that can be represented by a `long long`. This can be done by providing a `board` vector with a large number of elements, and each element set to a large value. The attacker can then use a specially crafted combination of elements in the `board` vector to cause the sum of the values to exceed the maximum value that can be represented by a `long long`.

Once the vulnerability is exploited, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system, leading to a potential security breach.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
