The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `gnutls_session_get_data` function takes a `size_t` parameter `session_data_size` that is used to determine the size of the buffer allocated for the session data. However, the function does not check if the buffer is large enough to hold the entire session data, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the session data is larger than the buffer.

The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a large session ticket that is larger than the buffer size, causing the function to write beyond the end of the buffer and potentially leading to a buffer overflow. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability, as the application may crash or behave unexpectedly.

To fix this vulnerability, the function should be modified to check if the buffer is large enough to hold the entire session data before writing to it.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the ImageStream class, which can cause an integer overflow when reading a crafted PDF file. This can lead to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
imgData.imgStr = new ImageStream(str, width,

The `ImageStream` class uses the `width` and `bits` parameters to allocate memory for the image data. However, if the `width` or `bits` parameters are too large, it can cause an integer overflow, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to craft a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large `width` or `bits` parameter in the `ImageStream` constructor.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the calculation of the rowSize variable. The rowSize variable is calculated as follows:

rowSize = (width + 7) >> 3;

If the width variable is large enough, the result of the expression (width + 7) will be greater than 2^31-1, which is the maximum value that can be stored in a signed 32-bit integer. When this happens, the result of the expression will be negative, which can cause an integer overflow.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a PDF file with a large value for the width variable, which can cause the rowSize variable to overflow and result in a buffer overflow. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

Therefore, it is important to fix this vulnerability by properly validating the width variable and preventing integer overflows.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `m_refreshDelayFactor` variable is not properly initialized. The `atof` function is used to convert the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute to a double, but it is not checked if the conversion was successful. If the conversion fails, the `m_refreshDelayFactor` variable will be left uninitialized, leading to undefined behavior.

In this specific case, the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute is not set in the XML file, so the `atof` function will return 0.0, which is a valid value for the `m_refreshDelayFactor` variable. However, if the attribute is set to a non-numeric value, the `atof` function will return NaN, which will cause the `m_refreshDelayFactor` variable to be left uninitialized.

177850,DoS Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a DoS_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-5289. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `datum_to_json` function does not properly handle JSON values that are too large to fit in the available memory. Specifically, the function uses a fixed-size buffer to store the JSON output, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the JSON value is too large. This can cause the server to crash, leading to a denial of service.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to send a specially crafted JSON value that is larger than the fixed-size buffer used by the `datum_to_json` function. This can be done by sending a JSON value that contains a large number of nested arrays or objects, which can cause the buffer to overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, the `datum_to_json` function should use dynamic memory allocation to allocate a buffer of the appropriate size, rather than using a fixed-size buffer. This will ensure that the function can handle JSON values of any size without risking a buffer overflow.","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input number is too large.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `memset` function to set the memory of the `pixBuf` array to zero. However, the size of the array is not properly validated, which allows an attacker to overflow the buffer and write arbitrary data to the memory. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, including the execution of malicious code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted request to the application, which would cause the `memset` function to write data to the `pixBuf` array. The attacker would need to know the size of the array and the location of the buffer in memory. Once the buffer is overflowed, the attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code, including the execution of malicious code.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly validate the size of the `pixBuf` array and ensure that it is not overflowed. Additionally, the code should use a safer function to set the memory of the array to zero, such as `memset_s` or `memset_safe`.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `rep.length` field in the `xListExtensionsReply` structure is a signed integer, but the `rlen` variable is an unsigned integer. When the `rep.length` field is negative, the `rlen` variable will be larger than the buffer size, leading to a buffer overflow.

177926,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code is a function that takes in a list of recipes, a list of ingredients for each recipe, and a list of supplies. It returns a list of recipes that can be made using the given supplies.

The function uses a breadth-first search algorithm to find the recipes that can be made using the given supplies. It maintains an adjacency list to keep track of the ingredients for each recipe and the recipes that use each ingredient. It also maintains an in-degree map to keep track of the number of recipes that use each ingredient.

The function iterates over the supplies and adds them to the queue. It then iterates over the queue and for each recipe in the queue, it checks if it can be made using the current supplies. If it can be made, it adds the recipe to the result list. If it cannot be made, it adds the recipes that use the current recipe to the queue.

The function does not use any user-supplied data, so it is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0586. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.
Vulnerability summary:
Integer overflow in the gst_vorbis_tag_add_coverart function (gst-libs/gst/tag/gstvorbistag.c) in vorbistag in gst-plugins-base (aka gstreamer-plugins-base) before 0.10.23 in GStreamer allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted COVERART tag that is converted from a base64 representation, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.

177927,,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function takes a string as input and copies it into a buffer without checking the size of the input. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is too large. The vulnerability is in the line `buf = emalloc(data_len + EVP_CIPHER_CTX_block_size(ctx));`. The `data_len` variable is not properly validated, and the `EVP_CIPHER_CTX_block_size(ctx)` function returns the block size of the cipher, which can be larger than the input string. This can cause the buffer to overflow and potentially lead to a crash or other security vulnerability.","The code contains a nan vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2017-11144. The CWE-ID is CWE-754.
Vulnerability summary:
In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, the openssl extension PEM sealing code did not check the return value of the OpenSSL sealing function, which could lead to a crash of the PHP interpreter, related to an interpretation conflict for a negative number in ext/openssl/openssl.c, and an OpenSSL documentation omission.
