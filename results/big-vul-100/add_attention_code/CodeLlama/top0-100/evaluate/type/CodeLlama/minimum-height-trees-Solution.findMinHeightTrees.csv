177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The function uses a map to check for specific user account control (UAC) bits and corresponding GUIDs. However, it does not properly check for administrative privileges, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC. The attacker can then use the Bypass vulnerability to bypass intended access restrictions and access sensitive data.

The fix for this vulnerability is to properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This can be done by adding additional checks to ensure that the user has the necessary privileges to perform the operation.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `fz_try` macro, which catches all exceptions and rethrows them as `FZ_ERROR_TRYLATER`. This allows an attacker to cause the parser to enter an infinite loop, leading to a denial of service.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to craft a specially crafted PDF file that causes the parser to enter the infinite loop. This can be done by providing a malicious PDF file that contains a crafted `pdf_xobject` object with a large number of nested `pdf_xobject` objects, each of which has a `pdf_xobject_matrix` function that returns a large matrix. This causes the parser to allocate a large amount of memory and eventually enter the infinite loop.

However, the `gmalloc` function does not check for memory allocation failures, and the program will continue to execute with a null pointer. This can lead to a buffer overflow when the program attempts to write to the null pointer.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large number of pixels, which can cause the program to allocate a large amount of memory and crash. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, as the program will be unavailable to users.

To fix the vulnerability, the `gmalloc` function should be modified to check for memory allocation failures and return an error code if the allocation fails. The program should also be designed to handle memory allocation failures gracefully, such as by returning an error code or terminating the program.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gets` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input string is too long. The `gets` function does not perform any bounds checking, and it does not provide any mechanism for the user to specify the maximum length of the input string. This means that an attacker can potentially overflow the buffer by providing a long input string, leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted PDF file to the application, which would cause the `gets` function to read data from the file into the buffer, potentially overflowing the buffer and leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

To fix this vulnerability, the `gets` function should be replaced with a safer function that performs bounds checking and provides a mechanism for the user to specify the maximum length of the input string. Alternatively, the application should be modified to use a safer function that performs bounds checking and provides a mechanism for the user to specify the maximum length of the input string.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the ImageStream class, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input stream contains a crafted PDF file. The ImageStream class uses a fixed-size buffer to read data from the input stream, and if the buffer is not large enough to hold the entire image, it can cause a buffer overflow. This can lead to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the FT_Load_Glyph function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input glyph index is too large. The function takes an FT_UInt as input, which is an unsigned integer type. However, the function does not perform any bounds checking on the input value, which means that an attacker can potentially overflow the buffer by providing a large value for the glyph index.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a crafted PDF file that contains a large glyph index value. The attacker could then use this value to overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the Poppler developers should perform bounds checking on the input glyph index value and prevent the buffer overflow.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `m_refreshDelayFactor` variable is not properly initialized. The `atof` function is used to convert the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute to a double, but it is not checked if the conversion was successful. If the conversion fails, the `m_refreshDelayFactor` variable will be left uninitialized, leading to undefined behavior.

In this specific case, the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute is not set in the XML file, so the `atof` function will return 0.0, which is a valid value for the `m_refreshDelayFactor` variable. However, if the attribute is set to a non-numeric value, the `atof` function will return NaN, which will cause the `m_refreshDelayFactor` variable to be left uninitialized.

The function `get_line` reads input from a file and stores it in a buffer, but it does not perform any bounds checking to ensure that the buffer is large enough to hold the input. If the input is too large, it will overflow the buffer and cause undefined behavior.

The vulnerability is caused by the `get_line` function, which is defined as follows:
```
chars_read = get_line ();
if (! chars_read) {
    next_intuit_at(beginning_of_this_line,p_input_line);

The `get_line` function reads input from a file and stores it in a buffer, but it does not perform any bounds checking to ensure that the buffer is large enough to hold the input. If the input is too large, it will overflow the buffer and cause undefined behavior.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a patch file that contains a large amount of input, causing the buffer to overflow. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, which can be used to gain unauthorized access to the system or steal sensitive information.

The code is a C++ function that parses an XML file using the libxml2 library. It does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or use-after-free errors.

However, it is important to note that the code is using the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` function, which can be vulnerable to XXE attacks if the XML file being parsed contains an XML external entity declaration. This is because the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` function does not perform any validation on the XML file, and it can be exploited by an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should use the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxtWithData` function instead, which takes an additional `data` parameter that can be used to specify a custom entity loader. This can be used to load the XML file in a secure manner, without allowing the possibility of an XXE attack.","The code contains a +Info vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses the `splashFloor` function to calculate the index of the line dash pattern, which can lead to an integer overflow if the phase is too large. This can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input that triggers the integer overflow.
