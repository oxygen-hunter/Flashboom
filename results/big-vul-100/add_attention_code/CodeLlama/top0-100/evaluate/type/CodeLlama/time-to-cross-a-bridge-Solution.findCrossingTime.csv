177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The function uses a hardcoded list of GUIDs to check for specific user account control flags, but it does not properly check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended access restrictions and create machine accounts with the desired user account control flags.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC. The attacker can then use the hardcoded GUIDs to create machine accounts with the desired user account control flags, which can lead to unauthorized access or escalation of privileges.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the code, which can cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is present in the following functions:

1. drawMaskedImage
2. drawSoftMaskedImage
3. fillImageMask
4. fillImageSrc
5. fillImageSrcColor
6. fillImageSrcGray
7. fillImageSrcRGB
8. fillImageSrcCMYK
9. fillImageSrcXBGR

These functions use integer arithmetic to calculate the size of the image, the number of pixels, and other parameters. If the input values are too large, the integer overflows can occur, leading to a vulnerability.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large image size or a large number of pixels, which can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer overflow vulnerability, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is caused by the `ImageStream::getNextLine` function, which reads data from the stream into a buffer, but does not check the buffer size before writing to it. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large image, which will cause the `ImageStream` class to read data from the stream into a buffer that is too small, leading to a buffer overflow. The overflow can be used to execute arbitrary code, leading to a denial of service or potentially a remote code execution vulnerability.

To fix the vulnerability, the `ImageStream` class should be modified to check the buffer size before writing to it, or a new buffer should be allocated with a larger size. Additionally, the `ImageStream` class should be used with a fixed buffer size, to prevent the vulnerability","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the FT_Load_Glyph function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input glyph index is too large. The function takes an FT_UInt as input, which is an unsigned integer type. However, the function does not perform any bounds checking on the input value, which means that an attacker can potentially overflow the buffer by providing a large value for the gid variable.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a crafted PDF file that contains a large glyph index value. This would cause the FT_Load_Glyph function to overflow the buffer, leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is not limited to the given code snippet, but rather it is a general issue with the FT_Load_Glyph function in the FreeType library. Therefore, it is recommended to use a secure version of the library that has been compiled with bounds checking enabled.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `findCrossingTime` function uses the `atof` function to convert a string to a double, which can lead to a nan vulnerability if the string is not a valid double. The function then proceeds to use the double value in calculations, which can lead to incorrect results or crashes.

This means that if the user-supplied string is longer than the buffer allocated for it, it will overflow the buffer and cause undefined behavior.

The vulnerability is in the line `auto_ptr_char s(child->getFirstChild()->getNodeValue());` where the user-supplied string is used to construct a new string without any bounds checking. If the user-supplied string is longer than the buffer allocated for it, it will overflow the buffer and cause undefined behavior.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can provide a specially crafted string that is longer than the buffer allocated for it. This can be done by sending a specially crafted XML document that contains a long string as the value of the `subst` attribute. The `auto_ptr_char` constructor will then allocate a buffer of the appropriate size to hold the string, but it will not perform any bounds checking. As a result, the string will overflow the buffer and cause undefined behavior.

177906,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses the `splashFloor` function to calculate the index of the line dash pattern, which can lead to an integer overflow if the phase is too large. This can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input that causes the phase to overflow. This can be done by providing a large value for the `lineDashPhase` parameter, which is then passed to the `splashFloor` function. If the value is too large, it will cause an integer overflow, leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that the `splashFloor` function is used safely and that the input values are properly validated to prevent such attacks.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` and `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macros, which are used to read data from the input stream. However, these macros do not perform any bounds checking on the input data, which can lead to buffer overflows if the input data is malicious.

In the given code, the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` macro is used to read a large amount of data from the input stream, which can potentially overflow the buffer allocated for the data. Similarly, the `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macro is used to read more data from the input stream, which can also potentially overflow the buffer.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a malicious input stream that contains a large amount of data, which can overflow the buffer allocated for the data. This can lead to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability, which can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that the input data is properly validated and sanitized to prevent buffer overflows and other vulnerabilities.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177922,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strcpy` function, which can copy more characters than the destination buffer can hold. This can lead to an overflow, which can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a specially crafted input that causes the `strcpy` function to copy more characters than the destination buffer can hold. This can be done by providing a long string that is longer than the destination buffer, or by using a specially crafted input that causes the `strcpy` function to copy more characters than the destination buffer can hold.
