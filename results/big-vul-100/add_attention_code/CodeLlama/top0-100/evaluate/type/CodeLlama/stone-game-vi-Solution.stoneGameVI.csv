The vulnerability arises from the use of the `cairo_image_surface_create_for_data` function, which takes a pointer to a buffer as an argument. The buffer is used to create a cairo surface, which is then used to create a pattern. The pattern is then used to mask the image.

The vulnerability occurs when the buffer is not properly allocated or when the buffer is not properly freed. If the buffer is not properly allocated, it can lead to a buffer overflow, which can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code. If the buffer is not properly freed, it can lead to a memory leak, which can cause the program to consume more memory than necessary and potentially lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses the `ImageStream` class to read image data from a stream, and the `ImageStream` class does not perform any bounds checking on the data it reads. This means that if the image data is maliciously crafted, it can cause the `drawMaskedImage` function to read beyond the end of the allocated memory, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to craft a malicious PDF file that contains a specially crafted image with a large width and height, and a small mask image with a small width and height. The mask image would need to be placed in a location in the PDF file where it is read by the `drawMaskedImage` function, and the image data would need to be crafted to cause the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the allocated memory.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `ImageStream` class should be modified to perform bounds checking on the data it reads, and the `drawMaskedImage` function should be modified to ensure","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177788,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the ImageStream class, which can cause an integer overflow when reading from the input stream. This can lead to a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
imgData.imgStr = new ImageStream(str, width,
                                colorMap->getNumPixelComps(),
                                colorMap->getBits());
```
The `ImageStream` class uses the `width` parameter to allocate a buffer for the image data, which can cause an integer overflow if the `width` parameter is too large. This can lead to a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a malicious PDF file with a large `width` parameter, which can cause the `ImageStream` class to allocate a large buffer and potentially execute arbitrary code.

Therefore, it is recommended to fix this vulnerability by ensuring that the `width` parameter is properly validated and sanitized before being used to allocate a buffer.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
