The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the code. The function takes an integer input, `bitsA`, and uses it to calculate the maximum value of a pixel, `maxPixel`, which is then used in a loop to allocate memory for an array. The loop iterates over the number of components in the color space, `nComps`, and allocates memory for each component.

The vulnerability occurs when the value of `bitsA` is set to a large value, causing the value of `maxPixel` to overflow. This can lead to a buffer overflow when the array is allocated, as the memory allocated for the array may not be enough to hold the data.

Additionally, the function also uses the value of `maxPixel` to calculate the size of the array, which can also lead to a buffer overflow if the value of `maxPixel` is too large.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a crafted PDF file with a large value for `bitsA`, causing the function to allocate a large amount of memory. This can lead to a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses the `ImageStream` class to read image data from a stream, and then passes the data to the `drawImage` function. The `drawImage` function then uses the `maskedImageSrc` function to draw the image, which in turn uses the `imageMaskSrc` function to draw the mask. The `imageMaskSrc` function uses the `fillImageMask` function to fill the mask with the image data, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the image data is too large.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large image and a small mask, which can cause the `fillImageMask` function to overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability, as well as an execution of arbitrary code.

To fix the vulnerability, the code should be updated to properly check the size of the image and mask data before passing it to the `fillImageMask` function.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the ImageStream class, which can cause an integer overflow when reading a crafted PDF file. This can lead to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
imgData.imgStr = new ImageStream(str, width,

                                colorMap->getBits());
```
The ImageStream class uses the width and bits parameters to allocate memory for the image data. If the width and bits parameters are not properly validated, an integer overflow can occur, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to provide a crafted PDF file with a malicious image stream that causes an integer overflow. This can be done by providing a malicious PDF file with a large width and bits value, which can cause the ImageStream class to allocate a large amount of memory, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially arbitrary code execution.

177839,+Info,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to any security vulnerabilities.

The code is a function that takes a string and a charset as input, and returns the next codepoint in the string. It uses the smb_iconv_handle structure to perform the conversion. The function checks the input string for validity and returns an invalid codepoint if the input is invalid.

The function also uses the get_conv_handle function to get a conversion handle, which is used to perform the conversion. The function checks the return value of the get_conv_handle function to ensure that it is not -1, which indicates an error.

The function then performs the conversion using the smb_iconv function, which takes the input string, the input length, the output buffer, and the output length as input. The function checks the return value of the smb_iconv function to ensure that it is not -1, which indicates an error.

The function then returns the next codepoint in the string, which is determined by the return value of the smb_iconv function.

177842,+Info,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to any security vulnerabilities.

The code is a function that takes a string as input and returns the next codepoint in the string. It uses a conversion descriptor to convert the string from one charset to another. The function also takes a pointer to a size_t variable that is used to keep track of the number of bytes consumed by the function.

The function first checks if the first character of the string is a valid codepoint. If it is, it returns the codepoint and updates the size_t variable. If it is not, it assumes that the string is a multi-byte character and tries to convert it to a codepoint using the conversion descriptor. If the conversion is successful, it returns the codepoint and updates the size_t variable. If the conversion is not successful, it returns an invalid codepoint and does not update the size_t variable.

The function does not use any user input or external data, so it is not vulnerable to buffer overflows or other security vulnerabilities. The only potential issue with the function is that it assumes that no multi-byte character can take more than 5 bytes, which may not be true for all charsets. However, this is a safe assumption for the charsets used in the function.

177921,,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a nan vulnerability. The code is using the `XListExtensions` function to retrieve a list of extensions supported by the X server, and it is properly checking the length of the response before attempting to read it. The code is also properly allocating memory for the response and checking for null pointers before using them. Therefore, there is no nan vulnerability in the code.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

177922,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code does not contain any buffer overflow vulnerabilities, as it properly checks the length of the input string and does not allow the input string to exceed the maximum length of the buffer. Additionally, the code does not use any unsafe functions such as strcpy or sprintf, which are commonly used in buffer overflow attacks.

However, the code does contain a potential use-after-free vulnerability. The function takes a pointer to a string as input, and then modifies the string in place. If the pointer points to a string that is allocated on the stack, and the function returns before the string is properly deallocated, then the string will be left in an inconsistent state and could potentially be used for attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the function should properly deallocate the string before returning, or the string should be copied to a new buffer before modification.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2019-11360. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.
Vulnerability summary:
A buffer overflow in iptables-restore in netfilter iptables 1.8.2 allows an attacker to (at least) crash the program or potentially gain code execution via a specially crafted iptables-save file. This is related to add_param_to_argv in xshared.c.

177923,Bypass,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The code checks the input parameters for null or empty values, and it also checks if the file exists before moving it. Additionally, it checks if the new path is within the open_basedir, if it is set.

The code also uses the php_check_open_basedir function to check if the new path is within the open_basedir, if it is set. This function checks if the new path is within the open_basedir, and if it is not, it returns false.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-2348. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.
Vulnerability summary:
The move_uploaded_file implementation in ext/standard/basic_functions.c in PHP before 5.4.39, 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 truncates a pathname upon encountering a \x00 character, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended extension restrictions and create files with unexpected names via a crafted second argument.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-7243.

177926,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code is a function that takes a base64-encoded image data and converts it into a GstBuffer. It uses the g_base64_decode_step function to decode the base64 data, which is a safe function. The function also uses the gst_tag_image_data_to_image_buffer function to create a GstBuffer from the decoded data, which is also a safe function.

Therefore, the code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to Exec Code Overflow.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0586. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.
Vulnerability summary:
Integer overflow in the gst_vorbis_tag_add_coverart function (gst-libs/gst/tag/gstvorbistag.c) in vorbistag in gst-plugins-base (aka gstreamer-plugins-base) before 0.10.23 in GStreamer allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted COVERART tag that is converted from a base64 representation, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.

Vulnerability summary:
In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, the openssl extension PEM sealing code did not check the return value of the OpenSSL sealing function, which could lead to a crash of the PHP interpreter, related to an interpretation conflict for a negative number in ext/openssl/openssl.c, and an OpenSSL documentation omission.
