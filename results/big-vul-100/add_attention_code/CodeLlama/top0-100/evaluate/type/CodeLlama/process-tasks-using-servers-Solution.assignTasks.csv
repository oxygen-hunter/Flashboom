This can lead to a buffer overflow and a crash of the `bgpd` process.

The vulnerability is related to the `CWE-404` issue, which is a type of buffer overflow vulnerability. The `stream_forward_getp` function is used to forward the read pointer of the input stream, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the input buffer. This means that an attacker can manipulate the input stream to cause the `bgp_attr_unknown` function to read beyond the end of the input buffer, leading to a buffer overflow and a crash of the `bgpd` process.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted BGP update message to the `bgpd` process, with a malicious attribute that is longer than the maximum allowed length.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `fz_try` macro, which catches all exceptions and rethrows them as `FZ_ERROR_TRYLATER`. However, the `fz_rethrow_if` function is used to check if the exception is `FZ_ERROR_TRYLATER`, and if so, it ignores the error and continues execution. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by intentionally causing the `fz_rethrow_if` function to ignore the error and continue execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to craft a PDF file that triggers the `fz_rethrow_if` function to ignore the error and continue execution. This could be done by including a malicious PDF object that causes the `fz_rethrow_if` function to ignore the error and continue execution, or by using a specially crafted PDF file that triggers the `fz_rethrow_if` function to ignore the error and continue execution.

177786,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the number of bytes read. This means that if the image data is corrupted or malicious, it can cause the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an exploitable crash or code execution.

Additionally, the `drawImage` method does not properly validate the `width` and `height` parameters, which can also lead to a buffer overflow if the image data is corrupted or malicious.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted PDF file that contains a malicious image with a large width and height, which can cause the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the buffer and overflow into the surrounding memory. This can lead to an exploitable crash or code execution, depending on the context in which the `drawImage` method is being used.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177787,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer of a fixed size, and if the image data exceeds this buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow. This can lead to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is caused by the `drawMaskedImage` function, which takes a `Stream` object as input and reads the image data from it. The `drawMaskedImage` function then uses the `ImageStream` class to read the image data from the `Stream` object, which can cause a buffer overflow if the image data exceeds the buffer size.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large image with a malicious payload. The malicious payload can be executed by the `drawMaskedImage` function, leading to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that the `ImageStream` class is used safely and that the buffer size is properly set to prevent buffer overflows.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer overflow vulnerability, which can be exploited to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the `ImageStream::getNext` method, which reads data from the stream into a buffer. The buffer is allocated on the stack, and its size is determined by the `maxBufSize` parameter. If the size of the data read from the stream exceeds the size of the buffer, the buffer overflows, leading to a vulnerability.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to send a crafted PDF file with a large image data stream. The image data stream should be larger than the `maxBufSize` parameter, which is set to 65536 by default. If the image data stream is larger than the buffer, the buffer overflows, and the attacker can execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ceil` function to calculate the size of the `cairo_data` buffer. If the `ceil` function is used with a large enough value, it can cause an integer overflow, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an executable code overflow.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large enough value for the `width` or `height` parameter, which can cause the `cairo_width` and `cairo_height` variables to overflow and the `cairo_data` buffer to be allocated with an excessive size. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, as the application may crash or become unresponsive due to the excessive memory usage.

Additionally, the `memset` function is used to initialize the `cairo_data` buffer with a specific value. If the value is 0x00, it can cause the buffer to be filled with null bytes, which can lead to an executable code overflow if the buffer is used to store executable code.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_Load_Glyph` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input glyph index is too large. The function takes an `FT_UInt` parameter, which is an unsigned integer, but the code checks if the input value is less than the length of the `codeToGID` array, which is a signed integer. This allows an attacker to send a crafted PDF file with a large glyph index, causing the `FT_Load_Glyph` function to overflow the buffer and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `atof` function is used to convert the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute to a double value, but the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute is not properly validated. If the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute is not a valid double value, the `atof` function will return a NaN value, which will be assigned to the `m_refreshDelayFactor` variable. This can lead to unintended behavior, including crashes or other vulnerabilities.

To fix this vulnerability, the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute should be properly validated before it is converted to a double value using the `atof` function. This can be done by checking if the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute is a valid double value before calling the `atof` function. If the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute is not a valid double value, an error should be reported and the program should exit.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
tempnames = gs_main_tempnames(minst);
```
The `gs_main_tempnames` function is used to retrieve a list of temporary files created by the Ghostscript interpreter. However, the function does not perform any bounds checking on the length of the returned string, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the string is too long.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could provide a specially crafted PostScript file that contains a long string of characters, which would overflow the buffer allocated for `tempnames`. This could potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause the Ghostscript interpreter to crash.

It is important to note that this vulnerability is not related to the CWE-120 buffer overflow, which is a different type of vulnerability.

177897,+Info,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The function takes a filename as an argument and uses it to create a parser context, which can potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the filename is too long. Additionally, the function does not perform any bounds checking on the filename, which can also lead to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability is due to the use of the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` function, which takes a filename as an argument and creates a parser context. The filename is not validated, and the function does not perform any bounds checking on the filename. This means that if the filename is too long, it can potentially overflow the buffer allocated for the filename, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can provide a long filename that exceeds the buffer size allocated for the filename. This can cause the parser to read beyond the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. The attacker can then use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system.

The vulnerability is fixed in PHP 5.3.22 and 5.4.12 by properly validating the filename and performing bounds checking on the filename.","The code contains a +Info vulnerability.

177906,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input value is too large.

If the input value is too large, the function will return a value that is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input value, but rather a value that is too large to be stored in an integer variable. This can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

For example, if the input value is 2^31 (which is the largest integer that can be stored in a 32-bit signed integer), the function will return 2^31 - 1, which is a valid integer. However, if the input value is 2^31 + 1, the function will return 2^31, which is not a valid integer and can cause a crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses the `gmalloc` and `gmallocn` functions to allocate memory, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the memory allocation fails. The `gmalloc` function allocates memory using the `malloc` function, which can return a null pointer if the allocation fails. The `gmallocn` function allocates an array of `n` elements, each of which is allocated using the `gmalloc` function. If any of the `gmalloc` calls fail, the `gmallocn` function will return a null pointer, leading to a buffer overflow.

Furthermore, the code uses the `memset` function to set the memory to zero, which can also lead to a buffer overflow if the memory allocation fails.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted input that causes the `gmalloc` or `gmallocn` function to fail, leading to a buffer overflow. This can be done by sending a specially crafted input that causes the `gmalloc` or `gmallocn` function to allocate more memory than is available, leading to","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177913,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro, which reads a 32-bit integer from the input buffer without performing any bounds checking. This allows an attacker to overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to send a specially crafted input that causes the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro to read beyond the end of the buffer. This can be done by sending a large value for the `length` parameter, which will cause the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro to read beyond the end of the buffer and execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability can be mitigated by properly validating the input and checking for buffer overflows. This can be done by using a bounds-checking function, such as `memchr`, to check for the presence of a null byte at the end of the buffer, or by using a fixed-size buffer and checking for buffer overflows using a loop.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` and `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macros, which are used to read data from the input stream. However, these macros do not perform any bounds checking on the input data, which can lead to an integer overflow if the input data is too large. Specifically, the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` macro reads the number of bytes to be read from the input stream, and the `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macro reads the data from the input stream into a buffer. However, if the number of bytes to be read is too large, it can cause an integer overflow, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input stream with a large number of bytes to be read, which can cause the program to write to memory outside the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. This can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, which can be used to escalate privileges or execute malicious code.
