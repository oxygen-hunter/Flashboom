The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `asn1_time_to_time_t` function does not properly parse the `notBefore` and `notAfter` timestamps in X.509 certificates. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) by crafting a malicious certificate that is not properly handled by the `openssl_x509_parse` function.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `asn1_time_to_time_t` function uses the `atoi` function to parse the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second values from the ASN.1 time string. However, this function does not properly handle the case where the input string is not a valid integer, which can lead to a buffer overflow or other security vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `gnutls_session_get_data` function takes a `session_data` parameter of type `void *` and a `session_data_size` parameter of type `size_t *`. The function then copies the session data into the `session_data` buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the `session_data` buffer is not large enough to hold the entire session data.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a large session ticket to the server, which can cause the server to allocate a large buffer to store the session data. If the client then sends a large session ticket again, the server will attempt to copy the session data into the buffer again, leading to a buffer overflow and a potential denial of service.

To fix the vulnerability, the `session_data` parameter should be changed to a fixed-size buffer, or the function should be modified to dynamically allocate a buffer large enough to hold the session data.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `gnutls_session_get_data` function takes a `size_t` parameter `session_data_size` and uses it to determine the size of the buffer to be allocated for the session data. However, the function does not check if the value of `session_data_size` is greater than the actual size of the session data, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a large value for `session_data_size` in the `gnutls_session_get_data` function, causing the function to allocate a buffer of the specified size and copy the session data into it. If the value of `session_data_size` is greater than the actual size of the session data, the function will copy data beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the line length. This means that if the image data is corrupted or malicious, it can cause the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially executing arbitrary code.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted PDF file that contains a malicious image with a large number of pixels. The malicious image can be used to cause a buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to a denial of service or other security vulnerabilities.

To fix the vulnerability, the `ImageStream` class should be modified to perform bounds checking on the line length, or a separate bounds checking function should be added to the `ImageStream` class. Additionally, the `drawImage` function should be modified to properly validate the image data and prevent buffer overflows.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the code. The function takes in a variable number of arguments, and the code does not properly check for integer overflows. This can lead to an integer overflow in the calculation of the `mat` array, which can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
mat[0] = (SplashCoord)width;
```
The `SplashCoord` type is a floating-point type, and the `width` variable is an integer. The cast from integer to floating-point can cause an integer overflow if the value of `width` is too large. This can lead to a buffer overflow when the `mat` array is created, as the size of the array is calculated based on the value of `width`.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a crafted PDF file with a large value of `width` and a small value of `height`. This can cause the `mat` array to be created with a large size, which can lead to a buffer overflow and potentially execute","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the calculation of the rowSize variable. The rowSize variable is calculated as follows:

rowSize = (width + 7) >> 3;

If the width variable is large enough, the result of the expression (width + 7) will be greater than 2^31-1, which is the maximum value that can be represented by an integer in C++. When this happens, the result of the expression will be negative, which will cause an integer overflow.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a PDF file with a large width value, which will cause the rowSize variable to overflow and result in a negative value. This will cause the data pointer to be set to a negative value, which will cause a buffer overflow when the data is accessed.

The vulnerability can be mitigated by using a 64-bit integer to store the rowSize variable, or by using a safer method to calculate the rowSize variable, such as using the ceil() function to round up the result of the expression.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `datum_to_json` function does not properly handle the `key_scalar` parameter, which is used to determine whether the current key is a scalar or not. If the `key_scalar` parameter is set to `true`, the function assumes that the current key is a scalar and does not perform any bounds checking on the input string. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is too long.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input string that is longer than the allocated buffer size. The input string can be crafted to contain a large number of characters, which can cause the buffer to overflow and overwrite the return address on the stack. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control of the program's execution flow.

To fix the vulnerability, the `datum_to_json` function should properly check the `key_scalar` parameter and perform bounds checking on the input string if the parameter is set to `true`.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code allows a symlink to point outside of a share, which can bypass intended file-access restrictions. This can be exploited by creating a symlink that points to a file outside of the share, and then using the symlink to access the file.

The vulnerability is in the `check_reduced_name_with_privilege` function, which checks if a file is within the share or not.

177856,,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `do_ed_script` takes in a file name as input and uses the `editor_program` variable to execute a shell command. The `editor_program` variable is set to the string ""ed"" which is a text editor program. The `editor_program` variable is then used in the `sprintf` function to create a shell command that is executed by the `execl` function. The `sprintf` function takes in a format string and a variable number of arguments, and returns a string that is the result of formatting the format string with the arguments. The format string in this case is ""%s %s%s"", which is a string that contains the editor program name, a space, and the output file name. The output file name is obtained from the `outname` variable, which is a file name that is passed in as an argument to the function.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `sprintf` function does not perform any bounds checking on the format string, and the output file name is not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by passing in a specially crafted file name that contains a format string that is longer than the maximum allowed length, and that contains a buffer overflow attack.

The function takes an untrusted input from the user, and then uses it to determine the size of a buffer that is allocated on the stack. The buffer is then used to store a string, which can potentially overflow the buffer and cause a buffer overflow attack.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strcpy` function, which copies the input string into the buffer without any bounds checking. This means that if the input string is longer than the buffer, it will overwrite the return address on the stack, causing the program to jump to a different location in memory. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, including code to bypass security mechanisms such as ASLR and DEP.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input string that is longer than the buffer, causing it to overflow and overwrite the return address on the stack. This can be done using a technique called ""return-oriented programming"" (ROP), where the attacker sends a series of instructions that are executed in the context of the program, and the instructions are designed to overwrite the return address on the stack with the address of a shellcode that can be executed.

The code is using the uninitialized memory to store the decrypted data, which can lead to a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:

aes_crypt_cbc(state->ctx, AES_DECRYPT, 16, state->iv, pr->ptr + 1, temp);

The variable 'temp' is used to store the decrypted data, but it is not initialized before being used. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the decrypted data is larger than the buffer allocated for it.

To fix the vulnerability, the code should initialize the memory before using it. One way to do this is to use the memset function to set the memory to a known value before using it. For example:

memset(temp, 0, sizeof(temp));

This will set the memory to all zeros, which can help prevent buffer overflows.

It is also recommended to use a secure memory allocation function like gs_alloc_bytes_immovable to allocate memory for the aes context. This will help prevent memory corruption and other security vulnerabilities.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input value is too large.

If the input value is too large, the function will return a value that is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input value, but rather a value that is too large to be represented by the integer type. This can cause the `lineDashStartIdx` variable to take on a value that is not within the bounds of the `state->lineDash` array, leading to a buffer overflow.

177922,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strcpy` function, which can copy more characters than the destination buffer can hold, leading to a buffer overflow. This can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
strcpy(param_buffer, *curchar);
```
The `strcpy` function copies the contents of the source buffer to the destination buffer, but it does not check if the destination buffer is large enough to hold the entire source buffer. If the destination buffer is too small, it can cause a buffer overflow, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use a safer function such as `strncpy` or `strlcpy` to copy the contents of the source buffer to the destination buffer. These functions allow you to specify the maximum number of characters to copy, so they can prevent buffer overflows.

Additionally, you should also check the return value of the `strcpy` function to ensure that it did not overflow the buffer. If the return value is greater than the size of the destination buffer, it means that the buffer overflowed, and you should handle the error accordingly.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2019-11360. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.
Vulnerability summary:
A buffer overflow in iptables-restore in netfilter iptables 1.8.2 allows an attacker to (at least) crash the program or potentially gain code execution via a specially crafted iptables-save file. This is related to add_param_to_argv in xshared.c.

177923,Bypass,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability. The code checks the input parameters for null or empty values, and it also checks the path and new_path for open_basedir restrictions. Additionally, it uses the php_check_open_basedir function to check the paths for open_basedir restrictions.

The code also uses the VCWD_RENAME function to move the file, which is a secure function. The VCWD_RENAME function checks the input parameters for null or empty values, and it also checks the path and new_path for open_basedir restrictions.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.
