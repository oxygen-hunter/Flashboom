177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The function uses a hardcoded list of UAC values and corresponding GUIDs, which are not properly validated. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended access restrictions by providing a malicious UAC value that is not in the hardcoded list.

The function also uses a hardcoded list of privileges that are required to perform certain actions, such as adding the UF_DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWD bit in userAccountControl. However, this list is not properly validated, and an attacker can provide a malicious privilege that is not in the hardcoded list.

Overall, the function does not properly check for administrative privileges, which allows an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions and potentially lead to a Bypass vulnerability.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

177787,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `powmod` function, which takes a large input `right` and computes the result of `powmod(2, f(right + 1) - f(left), mod)`. The function `f` is used to compute the number of set bits in the input `right`, and it has a potential integer overflow vulnerability.

If the input `right` is large enough, the computation `f(right + 1) - f(left)` can overflow, leading to an incorrect result. This can cause the `powmod` function to return an incorrect result, which can be used to execute arbitrary code.

Therefore, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177788,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `powmod` function, which takes a large input `right` and computes the result of `powmod(2, f(right + 1) - f(left), mod)`. The function `f` is used to compute the number of set bits in the input `right`, and it has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of bits in the input.

The vulnerability occurs when the input `right` is very large, causing the time complexity of `f` to be very high. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, as the function can take a long time to complete, causing the application to become unresponsive.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a large input `right` to the `powmod` function, causing the function to take a long time to complete. This can lead to a DoS attack, where the application becomes unresponsive and unable to process other requests.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `powmod` function should be optimized to reduce its time complexity","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177789,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ceil` function, which can cause an integer overflow if the input value is too large. The `ceil` function is used to calculate the width and height of the output surface, and the resulting values are then used to create a new surface using the `cairo_image_surface_create_for_data` function.

If the input values are too large, the resulting surface size can exceed the maximum allowed size, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an executable code overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the input values should be validated and sanitized to ensure they are within the expected range. Additionally, the `ceil` function should be replaced with a safer alternative, such as the `round` function, to avoid integer overflows.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the FT_Load_Glyph function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input glyph index is too large. The function takes an FT_UInt as input, which is an unsigned integer type. However, the function does not perform any bounds checking on the input value, which means that an attacker can potentially overflow the buffer by providing a large value for the glyph index.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a crafted PDF file that contains a large glyph index value. The attacker could then use this value to overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.

This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2009-0791, which is also a buffer overflow vulnerability in the FT_Load_Glyph function.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `powmod` function, which takes a large input `x` and computes `powmod(2, f(right + 1) - f(left), mod)`. The `f` function is a function that computes the number of set bits in a number, and it is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.

The `f` function uses a loop to iterate over the bits of the input number, and it uses the `count1` and `count2` functions to count the number of set bits in the input number. The `count1` function uses a binary search to find the first set bit in the input number, and it uses the `max` function to ensure that the result is non-negative. The `count2` function uses a similar approach to find the number of set bits in the input number, but it also computes the number of set bits in the previous number.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `max` function, which takes a large input `x` and computes `max(x - (1ll << i) + 1, 0ll)`.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input value is too large.

If the input value is too large, the function will return a value that is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input value, but rather a value that is too large to fit in the integer type. This can cause the `i` variable to become a very large value, leading to an integer overflow.

Once the integer overflow occurs, the `i` variable can become a very large value, leading to an integer overflow. This can cause the `j` variable to become a very large value, leading to an integer overflow. This can cause the `k` variable to become a very large value, leading to an integer overflow.

177913,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro, which reads a 32-bit integer from the input buffer without performing any bounds checking. This allows an attacker to overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to send a specially crafted input that causes the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro to read beyond the end of the buffer. This can be done by sending a large value for the `length` parameter, which is used to determine the end of the buffer. If the `length` value is too large, the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro will read beyond the end of the buffer, leading to an overflow.

Once the overflow occurs, the attacker can execute arbitrary code by exploiting the use of the `memcpy` function. The `memcpy` function is used to copy data from one location to another, and it can be used to execute arbitrary code by overwriting the memory with a shellcode.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should perform bounds checking on the `length` parameter to ensure that it is","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `powmod` function, which takes a large input `right` and computes the result of `powmod(2, f(right + 1) - f(left), mod)`. The function `f` is a recursive function that computes the number of trailing zeros in a number. The vulnerability occurs when the input `right` is large enough to cause a stack overflow.

The `powmod` function is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow because it uses a recursive function `f` that can cause a stack overflow if the input `right` is large enough. The `f` function is vulnerable because it uses a recursive approach to compute the number of trailing zeros, which can cause a stack overflow if the input `right` is large enough.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to provide a large input `right` to the `powmod` function. The attacker can do this by sending a specially crafted input to the `powmod` function, which can cause a stack overflow and execute arbitrary code.
