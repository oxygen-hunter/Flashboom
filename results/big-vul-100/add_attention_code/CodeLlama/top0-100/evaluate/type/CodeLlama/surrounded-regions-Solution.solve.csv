177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The function does not check for the presence of the required rights, which are necessary to create machine accounts. This allows an attacker to create machine accounts with the required rights, bypassing the intended access restrictions.

The vulnerability is in the following line of code:
```
if (map[i].uac & user_account_control) {
    //...
}
```
The `map[i].uac` variable is a bitmask that represents the user account control flags. The `user_account_control` variable is the user account control value that is being checked.

177786,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `drawImage` function, which takes a `Stream` object as input and processes it in a way that can lead to a buffer overflow. The function uses the `ImageStream` class to read the input stream, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input stream is maliciously crafted.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large image that is processed by the `drawImage` function. The image data can be crafted to cause a buffer overflow by sending a large number of pixels, which can lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `drawImage` function should be modified to properly validate the input stream and prevent buffer overflows. Additionally, the `ImageStream` class should be modified to properly handle large input streams and prevent buffer overflows.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177787,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the ImageStream class, which can cause integer overflows when processing large PDF files. The code does not properly check for overflows, which can lead to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
imgData.imgStr = new ImageStream(str, width,
				     colorMap->getNumPixelComps(),
				     colorMap->getBits());
```
The `width` parameter is not properly validated, and can be set to a large value, leading to an integer overflow when calculating the size of the image. This can cause the `ImageStream` object to allocate a large amount of memory, leading to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution.

To fix the vulnerability, the code should properly validate the `width` parameter and ensure that it is within a reasonable range. Additionally, the code should properly check for overflows when processing large PDF files, and take appropriate action to prevent the vulnerability from occurring.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the ImageStream class, which can cause integer overflows when processing large PDF files. The code allocates memory for the image data and then processes it, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the image data is too large. This can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted PDF file with a large image that causes the integer overflow. The attacker can then use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the target system.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer data structure to store the image data, such as a dynamic array or a linked list. Additionally, the code should check for integer overflows and handle them properly to prevent the vulnerability.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

Additionally, it does not check if the XML document is well-formed or if it has any errors, which could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

177899,+Info,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to any security vulnerabilities.

The code is a C++ function that takes a string argument and returns a pointer to an xmlDocPtr structure. It does not appear to contain any security vulnerabilities, as it does not perform any operations that could potentially lead to a security breach.

However, it is important to note that the code is not secure because it does not properly validate user input. The function takes a string argument, but it does not check whether the string is a valid XML file or not. This could lead to a vulnerability if an attacker were to pass a malicious string as an argument.

Therefore, it is recommended to add proper input validation to the function to ensure that only valid XML files are processed.","The code contains a +Info vulnerability.

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` and `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macros, which are used to read and write data to the stream. These macros are used to read and write data to the stream in a way that is not bounds-checked, which can lead to buffer overflows if the data is not properly validated.

In the given code, the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` macro is used to read data from the stream into the `charset->sids` array. The `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macro is used to write data from the `charset->sids` array to the stream. However, these macros are not properly bounds-checked, which means that they do not check whether the data being read or written is within the bounds of the array.

Therefore, if the `num_glyphs` parameter is set to a large value, the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` macro will attempt to read data from the stream into the `charset->sids` array, which may overflow the buffer if the data","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
