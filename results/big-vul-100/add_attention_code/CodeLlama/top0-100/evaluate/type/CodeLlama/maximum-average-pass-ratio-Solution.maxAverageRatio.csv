The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the code, which can lead to a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `maskWidth` and `maskHeight` variables, which are used to determine the size of the mask image. If the `maskWidth` or `maskHeight` values are too large, they can cause an integer overflow, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially executing arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to craft a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large `maskWidth` or `maskHeight` value. This can be done by using a specially crafted image or by using a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large image. Once the PDF file is opened, the buffer overflow can occur, leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

It is important to note that this vulnerability is not present in all versions of Poppler, and it is not present in all versions of the code.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer size of 4096 bytes, which can be overflowed by a crafted PDF file. If the buffer size is exceeded, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the `imgMaskData.imgStr->reset()` function, which resets the `ImageStream` object to its initial state. However, the `ImageStream` object is not properly initialized, which can cause a buffer overflow.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to craft a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large image with a small buffer size. When the image is read, the buffer size is exceeded, causing a buffer overflow and potentially executing arbitrary code.

This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2009-0791, but it is more severe because it allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The code is using the `strnlen` function to get the length of a string, but it is not using the return value of the function correctly. The function returns the number of bytes in the string, not the number of characters.

177850,DoS Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-5289. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `datum_to_json` function does not properly handle the `key_scalar` parameter, which is used to determine whether the input value is a scalar or not. If the `key_scalar` parameter is set to `true`, the function does not properly check the input value for buffer overflows, which can lead to a denial of service (server crash) attack.

The vulnerability is caused by the `appendStringInfoString` function, which does not properly check the input string for buffer overflows. The `appendStringInfoString` function is used to append the output string to the `result` string, and it does not properly check the input string for buffer overflows. This means that if the input string is too large, it can cause a buffer overflow, leading to a denial of service (server crash) attack.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted input string that is larger than the allocated buffer size. This can cause the `appendStringInfoString` function to write data to the buffer beyond the allocated size, leading to a buffer overflow. The attack","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

177874,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to Exec_Code_Overflow. The CVE-ID is CVE-2018-15911. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of uninitialized memory in the aesdecode operator. An attacker can supply crafted PostScript to the interpreter, which can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the RSb and FSb arrays, which are not initialized. The arrays are used to perform the AES decryption, but the values in the arrays are not properly initialized. This allows an attacker to manipulate the values in the arrays, leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to supply a crafted PostScript that can manipulate the values in the RSb and FSb arrays. Once the arrays are manipulated, the attacker can execute arbitrary code, leading to a denial-of-service or other security vulnerability.

The vulnerability is not related to the use of C++ language features, but rather a result of the implementation of the AES algorithm.

177875,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2018-15911. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of uninitialized memory in the aesdecode operator. The code does not properly check the size of the input data, which can lead to a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
memcpy(temp, pr->ptr + 1, 16);
```
The code copies 16 bytes from the input buffer to the temporary buffer without checking if the input buffer is large enough. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input buffer is not large enough to hold the 16 bytes being copied.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can supply a crafted PostScript file that contains a large amount of data in the input buffer. The buffer overflow can cause the code to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to a denial-of-service or other security vulnerabilities.

An attacker can send a specially crafted command to the FDC, which can cause the FDC to read beyond the bounds of the allocated memory buffer, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially executing arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:

`retval = fdctrl->fifo[pos];`

Here, the `pos` variable is not properly validated, and it is used to access the `fdctrl->fifo` array, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the `pos` value is greater than the size of the array.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The `splashFloor` function is used to round the `lineDashStartPhase` value down to the nearest integer. However, if the `lineDashStartPhase` value is very large, the result of the `splashFloor` function can be a very large integer, which can cause an integer overflow when it is used to index the `state->lineDash` array. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read, which can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a specially crafted input that causes the `lineDashStartPhase` value to be very large. This can be done by providing a specially crafted input to the `makeDashedPath` function, which can cause the `lineDashStartPhase` value to be very large. Once the `lineDashStartPhase` value is very large, the attacker can use it to cause an integer overflow","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gmalloc` and `gmallocn` functions, which allocate memory without bounds checking. The `scaleMaskYdXu` function uses these functions to allocate memory for the `lineBuf` and `pixBuf` arrays, which are then used to process the input data. However, the function does not check the size of the input data, and it does not limit the size of the allocated memory.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` and `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macros, which are used to read data from the input stream. However, these macros do not perform any bounds checking on the input data, which can lead to an integer overflow if the input data is too large. Specifically, the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` macro reads the number of bytes to be read from the input stream, and the `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macro reads the data from the input stream into a buffer. However, if the number of bytes to be read is too large, it can cause an integer overflow, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input stream with a large number of bytes to be read, which can cause the program to read data from an unexpected location in memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

",1.0,656.0,6.0,2.454827070236206
177927,,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The function takes a string as input and copies it into a buffer without checking the size of the input. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is larger than the buffer, causing the program to write beyond the end of the buffer and potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is in the line `buf = emalloc(data_len + EVP_CIPHER_CTX_block_size(ctx));`. The `data_len` variable is not properly validated, and the `EVP_CIPHER_CTX_block_size(ctx)` function returns the block size of the cipher, which can be larger than the input data. This means that the buffer allocated by `emalloc` may be too small to hold the input data, leading to a buffer overflow.
