177786,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `min` function in the `minCostToEqualizeArray` function, which can be tricked into executing arbitrary code. The `min` function is used to find the minimum value in a vector of integers, but it can also be used to execute arbitrary code by providing a vector of integers that are all equal to the minimum value. This can be done by providing a vector of integers that is all equal to the minimum value, but with a few extra elements that are all equal to the minimum value. The `min` function will return the minimum value, which is the minimum value of the first element, but it will also execute the code in the last element, which is the arbitrary code.

Therefore, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a vector of integers that is all equal to the minimum value, but with a few extra elements that are all equal to the minimum value. This will cause the `min` function to return the minimum value, but it will also execute the arbitrary code in the last element. This can be used to execute arbitrary code with a low computational overhead.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_Load_Glyph` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input glyph index is too large. The function takes an `FT_UInt` parameter, which is an unsigned integer type, and the input glyph index is cast to this type. However, if the input glyph index is too large, it can cause an integer overflow, leading to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large glyph index, which can cause the `FT_Load_Glyph` function to overflow the buffer and crash the application. This can be done by sending a malicious PDF file with a large number of glyphs, which can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the `FT_Load_Glyph` function should be modified to check for integer overflows and prevent buffer overflows. This can be done by using a safer function, such as `FT_Load_Glyph_Internal`, which checks for integer overflows and prevents buffer overflows.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `minCostToEqualizeArray` function has a loop that iterates over the input array `nums` and performs a costly operation (either `cost1` or `cost2`) on each element. The loop continues until the total cost of the operations exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in an `int64_t` variable.

The code is a function that takes in a vector of integers and two integers representing the cost of performing a cost1 or cost2 operation. The function returns the minimum cost required to equalize the array.

The function first calculates the total number of operations required to equalize the array, which is the maximum value in the array multiplied by the number of elements in the array minus the sum of the elements.

The function then checks if the number of elements in the array is less than or equal to 2. If it is, the function returns the total number of cost1 operations required to equalize the array.

If the number of elements in the array is greater than 2, the function calculates the minimum number of cost1 operations required to equalize the array by subtracting the maximum value in the array from the total number of operations and dividing the result by the number of elements in the array.

The function then calculates the minimum number of cost2 operations required to equalize the array by subtracting the minimum value in the array from the total number of operations and dividing the result by the number of elements in the array.

Finally, the function returns the minimum of the two calculated values, which is the minimum number of cost1 operations required to equalize the array.

177893,+Info,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The function takes an unbounded amount of input from the user, and then uses a series of string and memory functions to manipulate the input. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a specially crafted input that is longer than the buffer size. This can be done by using a technique called ""return-oriented programming"" (ROP), where the attacker provides a series of return addresses that point to a series of instructions that can be used to execute arbitrary code.

For example, an attacker could provide a specially crafted input that contains a series of return addresses that point to a series of instructions that can be used to execute a ""pop rdi; ret"" instruction, which would pop the address of a shellcode from the stack and execute it. This would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the program.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly bounds check the input and prevent buffer overflows. This can be done by using a technique called ""data execution prevention"" (DEP), which prevents code from executing in memory regions marked as non-executable.

Additionally, the code should be modified to properly validate user input and sanitize it to prevent injection attacks. This","The code contains a +Info vulnerability.
