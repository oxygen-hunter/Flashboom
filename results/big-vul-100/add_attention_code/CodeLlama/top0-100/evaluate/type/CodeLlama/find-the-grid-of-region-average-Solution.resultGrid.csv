177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The function uses a hardcoded list of UAC values and corresponding GUIDs, which are not properly validated. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended access restrictions by providing a malicious UAC value that is not in the hardcoded list.

The function also uses a hardcoded list of privileges that are required to perform certain actions, such as adding the UF_DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWD bit in userAccountControl. However, this list is not properly validated, and an attacker can provide a malicious privilege that is not in the hardcoded list.

Overall, the function does not properly check for administrative privileges, which allows an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions and potentially lead to a security breach.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream and returns it as a `SplashColorPtr`. The `SplashColorPtr` is then used to draw the image on the screen.

The vulnerability occurs when the `ImageStream` class is used to read a large image file, which can cause the application to crash due to a buffer overflow.

177786,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream and returns it as a `SplashColorPtr`. The `SplashColorPtr` is then used to draw the image on the screen.

The vulnerability occurs when the `ImageStream` class is used to read a large image file, which can cause the application to crash due to a buffer overflow. The buffer overflow occurs because the `ImageStream` class does not properly check the size of the image data being read, and it does not properly allocate memory for the image data. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can cause the application to crash.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large image, which can cause the application to crash. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, as the application may become unavailable to users.

The ImageStream class does not properly check the size of the image data, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the image data is maliciously crafted. This can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly check the size of the image data before allocating memory for it. This can be done by using the ImageStream::getSize() method to get the size of the image data and then allocating memory for it.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the FT_Load_Glyph function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input glyph index is too large. The function takes an FT_UInt as input, which is an unsigned integer type. However, the function does not perform any bounds checking on the input value, which means that an attacker can potentially overflow the buffer by providing a large value for the glyph index.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a crafted PDF file that contains a large glyph index value. The attacker could then use this value to overflow the buffer and cause a crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point value as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that value.

177913,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro, which reads the next 32-bit value from the input buffer without performing any bounds checking. This allows an attacker to overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input that causes the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro to read beyond the end of the buffer. This can be done by providing a large value for the `length` parameter, which is used to determine the size of the input buffer. If the `length` value is too large, the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro will read beyond the end of the buffer, leading to an overflow.
