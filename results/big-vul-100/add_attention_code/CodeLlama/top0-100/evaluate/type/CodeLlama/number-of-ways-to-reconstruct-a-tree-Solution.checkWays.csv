The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer of a fixed size, and if the image data exceeds this buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow. This can lead to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is caused by the `imgData.imgStr->getLine();` line, which reads a line of image data from the stream. If the image data exceeds the buffer size, it can overwrite the return address on the stack, leading to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to send a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large image with a malicious payload. The payload can be executed when the image is rendered, leading to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is fixed in Poppler 0.10.6 and later versions.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the ImageStream class, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input stream contains a crafted PDF file. The code does not properly check the size of the input stream, which can lead to an integer overflow and a buffer overflow. This can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ceil` function to calculate the width and height of the output surface. If the input values are large enough, the resulting width and height can overflow the integer variables, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an arbitrary code execution.

The code is vulnerable because it does not perform proper bounds checking on the input values, and it does not use a safe integer type to store the width and height. Additionally, the code does not properly handle the case where the input values are too large, leading to a potential buffer overflow.

To fix the vulnerability, the code should use a safe integer type, such as `size_t`, to store the width and height, and it should perform proper bounds checking on the input values. It should also handle the case where the input values are too large, by either returning an error or by using a safe integer type to store the width and height.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177792,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the calculation of the rowSize variable. The rowSize variable is calculated as follows:

rowSize = (width + 7) >> 3;

If the width variable is large enough, the result of the expression (width + 7) will be greater than 2^31-1, which is the maximum value that can be represented by an integer in C++. This will cause an integer overflow, which can lead to a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to send a crafted PDF file with a large value for the width variable. The attacker can use a tool such as the ""pdf-parser"" tool to create a malicious PDF file with a large width value. Once the PDF file is processed by the Poppler library, the buffer overflow will occur, leading to a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.

Therefore, it is important to fix this vulnerability by properly validating the width variable and preventing integer overflows.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the FT_Load_Glyph function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input glyph index is too large. The function takes an FT_UInt as input, which is a 32-bit unsigned integer. However, the function can be tricked into loading a glyph index that is larger than the maximum value of FT_UInt, which is 2^32 - 1. This can cause the function to read beyond the end of the allocated memory buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large glyph index. The attacker can use this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) or to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should be updated to use a 64-bit integer to represent the glyph index, or to check the input glyph index for overflow before passing it to the FT_Load_Glyph function.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

There is no buffer overflow or use-after-free vulnerability in the code, as it does not involve any user-supplied data or unchecked array access. There is also no memory leak or integer overflow vulnerability, as the function does not dynamically allocate any memory or perform any arithmetic operations that could lead to an overflow.

The only potential vulnerability in the code is a potential null pointer dereference if the pointer to the conversion handle is null. However, this is not a security vulnerability, as it would simply cause a crash.

177850,DoS Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-5289. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly handle the case where the input string is longer than the buffer allocated for it. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted input string that is longer than the buffer allocated for it. The buffer overflow can occur when the input string is copied into the buffer, leading to the overwriting of the return address on the stack. This can cause the program to jump to a different location in memory, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability can be mitigated by properly validating the input string and ensuring that it does not exceed the buffer size. This can be done by using a secure function such as strncpy or strlcpy, which allows the programmer to specify the maximum number of characters to copy. Alternatively, the programmer can use a fixed-size buffer and ensure that the input string is null-terminated.","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

",1.0,793.0,6.0,2.567617893218994
177905,DoS,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `imgCoordMungeLowerC` and `imgCoordMungeUpperC` functions, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input data is not properly validated.

The `imgCoordMungeLowerC` function takes a `SplashCoord` as input and returns a `int` value. The `imgCoordMungeUpperC` function takes a `SplashCoord` as input and returns a `int` value. Both functions are used to calculate the minimum and maximum values of a coordinate, respectively.

The vulnerability arises when an attacker provides a malicious input to these functions, causing a buffer overflow. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a large input value that exceeds the size of the buffer used to store the coordinate values. This can cause the program to write beyond the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted input to the `imgCoordMungeLowerC` or `imgCoordMungeUpperC` function, causing a buffer overflow. This can lead to a crash or other unpredictable behavior, potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

177906,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input value is too large.

If the input value is too large, the function will return a value that is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input value, but rather a value that is too large to be represented by the integer type. This can cause the `lineDashStartIdx` variable to take on a value that is not within the bounds of the `state->lineDash` array, leading to a buffer overflow.

Furthermore, the `lineDashDist` variable is also calculated using the `splashFloor` function, which can also lead to buffer overflows if the input value is too large.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input to the `makeDashedPath` function, which can cause the program to crash or execute","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The code does not contain any obvious buffer overflows or use-after-free errors. However, it does contain a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the line `pix = (pix * d) >> 23;`. If the value of `pix` is close to the maximum value of an integer, and the value of `d` is close to 255, then the multiplication `pix * d` can overflow and result in an incorrect value. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other security vulnerability if the value of `pix` is used to access memory outside of the allocated buffer.

However, the code does not contain any obvious buffer overflows or use-after-free errors, and the integer overflow vulnerability can be mitigated by using a safe integer type or by implementing proper bounds checking.

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` and `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macros, which are used to read data from the input stream. However, the code does not properly check the return value of these macros, which can lead to an integer overflow if the input data is too large. Specifically, the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` macro is used to read a large number of bytes from the input stream, and the `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macro is used to read the same number of bytes back. However, if the input data is too large, the `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macro can overflow the buffer, leading to an exploitable crash.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to send a specially crafted input that causes the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` macro to read a large number of bytes from the input stream. The attacker can then send a second input that causes the `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macro to read the same number of bytes back, which can overflow the buffer and lead to","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
