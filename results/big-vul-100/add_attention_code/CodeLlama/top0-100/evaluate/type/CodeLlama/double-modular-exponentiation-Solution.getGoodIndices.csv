177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are necessary to create machine accounts. This allows an attacker to create a machine account with the desired UAC bits set, even if they do not have the necessary rights.

The function uses a hardcoded list of required rights, which is not sufficient to prevent the vulnerability. The function should check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, and only allow creation of machine accounts if the rights are present.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

The code is using the `estrdup` function to allocate memory for the `strbuf` variable, which is a buffer that is used to store the time string. The `estrdup` function is a wrapper around the `malloc` function, which allocates memory from the heap. The memory allocated by `estrdup` is not freed until the `strbuf` variable goes out of scope, which is when the function returns.

Therefore, there is no memory leak in the code.

Additionally, the code is not using any deprecated or insecure functions, such as `strcpy`, `gets`, or `scanf`. It is using the `snprintf` function to format the time string, which is a safer alternative to `sprintf`.

The code is also not using any improper error handling mechanisms, such as ignoring or mishandling exceptions or errors. It is using the `php_error_docref` function to log errors, which is a safer alternative to `printf`.

Overall, the code is using proper memory management and error handling mechanisms, which reduces the risk of memory leaks and other security vulnerabilities.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow_Mem._Corr. vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `powmod` function, which computes the modular exponentiation of two integers. The function has a potential integer overflow when the base and the exponent are close to the modulus. Specifically, if the base is `2^31 - 1` and the exponent is `2^31 - 2`, the result of the modular exponentiation will be `2^31 - 1`, which is greater than the modulus `2^31 - 1`.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `powmod` function, which calculates the power of a number modulo a prime number. The function uses the modulo operator to avoid overflow, but this can lead to incorrect results if the power is very large.

For example, if `variables[i][1]` is a large number, the function `powmod(variables[i][0], variables[i][1], 10)` may return a value that is not correct modulo 10. This can lead to a buffer overflow when the result is used to index an array.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a specially crafted input that causes the `strcpy` function to copy more bytes than the destination buffer can hold. This can be done by providing a string that is longer than the destination buffer, and by using a format string vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.

The `powmod` function is not vulnerable to a DoS attack because it is not possible to cause a buffer overflow or other type of vulnerability by passing a large value as the `b` parameter.

However, it is possible to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by passing a large value as the `mod` parameter, which could cause the `powmod` function to take a long time to execute. This is because the `powmod` function uses a loop to calculate the power of the number, and the loop could run for a long time if the `mod` parameter is large.

To prevent this type of attack, it is recommended to use a bounded loop to calculate the power of the number, and to limit the maximum value of the `mod` parameter.

177919,,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `XListFonts` takes a pattern as input, which is then used to construct a request to the X server. The request is then sent to the server, and the server responds with a list of font names. The code then unpacks the response into null-terminated strings, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the response is too large.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the code does not check the length of the response before unpacking it, which can lead to an overflow if the response is too large. Additionally, the code does not properly null-terminate the strings, which can also lead to buffer overflows.

The code is a function that takes a display pointer and an integer pointer as input, and it allocates memory for a list of strings using Xmalloc. The function then reads data from the display into the allocated memory, and it checks the length of the data to ensure that it is not greater than the maximum allowed length. The function then unpacks the data into null-terminated strings and returns the list of strings.

Therefore, the code does not contain any nan vulnerabilities.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

The code is using the `powmod` function to calculate the result of a modular exponentiation, which is a secure way to perform the calculation. The `powmod` function is not vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability because it uses the modular exponentiation algorithm, which is a well-known and widely used algorithm for performing modular exponentiation.

However, the code is vulnerable to other types of vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflow, use after free, memory leak, integer overflow/underflow, null pointer dereference, improper input validation, race conditions, insecure function usage, insecure resource management, and improper error handling.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

177926,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code is using the `g_base64_decode_step` function to decode a base64-encoded string, which is a safe function to use. The function takes the input string, the length of the input string, a buffer to store the decoded data, and two variables to keep track of the state of the decoding process. The function returns the length of the decoded data, which is then used to create a `GstBuffer` object.

The code is not using any unsafe functions or operations, and it is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

",1.0,767.0,6.0,5.927433013916016
177927,,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function takes a string as input and copies it into a buffer without checking the size of the input. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is too large.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strcpy` function, which does not perform any bounds checking on the input string. Instead, it blindly copies the input string into the buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is too large.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted input string that is larger than the buffer size. This can cause the program to write beyond the end of the buffer, leading to unpredictable behavior and potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.
