The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are required to set the UF_DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWD, UF_ENCRYPTED_TEXT_PASSWORD_ALLOWED, UF_SERVER_TRUST_ACCOUNT, UF_PARTIAL_SECRETS_ACCOUNT, and UF_INTERDOMAIN_TRUST_ACCOUNT bits in the userAccountControl attribute.

The function does not properly check for the presence of these rights, which allows an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions and create machine accounts with the required rights.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the code. The function takes an integer input 'bitsA' and uses it to calculate the maximum value of a pixel (maxPixel) and the number of components in the color space (nComps). The function then uses these values to allocate memory for the lookup table and to calculate the default ranges for the color space.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for integer overflows when calculating the maximum value of a pixel or the number of components in the color space. This means that if the input value 'bitsA' is large enough, the function can overflow and cause a buffer overflow or other security vulnerability.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can provide a large value for 'bitsA' in the input, which can cause the function to allocate a large amount of memory and potentially overflow. This can lead to a denial of service or other security vulnerability.

Therefore, it is important to fix this vulnerability by adding proper bounds checking and error handling to the function.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gmalloc` function, which allocates memory using the `new` operator. If the `new` operator fails to allocate memory, it throws a `bad_alloc` exception. However, the code does not handle this exception properly, and instead continues to execute the code as if the allocation was successful. This can lead to a buffer overflow, as the code writes data to the allocated memory without checking the bounds.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large number of pages, each with a large number of objects. The `gmalloc` function is called repeatedly to allocate memory for each object, and if the allocation fails, the code continues to execute without checking the bounds. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

177786,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `upper_bound` function in the `minWastedSpace` function. The `upper_bound` function returns the first element in the range that is greater than the value of the second argument. In this case, the second argument is a value from the `box` vector, which is a vector of integers. The `upper_bound` function is used to find the first element in the `packages` vector that is greater than the current value of the `box` vector.

The vulnerability arises when the `box` vector contains a value that is greater than the largest value in the `packages` vector. In this case, the `upper_bound` function will return the end iterator of the `packages` vector, which is `cend(packages)`. This will cause the `curr` variable to be incremented by the number of elements in the `packages` vector, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to provide a crafted PDF file that contains a large value in the `box` vector. The value should be greater than the largest value in","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses the `drawMaskedImage` function to draw an image with a mask. The mask is used to determine which parts of the image are visible, and the code uses the `maskedImageSrc` function to apply the mask to the image. However, the code does not properly validate the mask, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the mask is too large.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large mask that exceeds the size of the image. The overflow can occur when the code tries to read the mask data from the stream, and the data is not properly bounded. This can cause the code to read beyond the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an arbitrary code execution.

To fix the vulnerability, the code should properly validate the mask and ensure that it does not exceed the size of the image. This can be done by checking the size of the mask and the image, and ensuring that the mask is not larger than the image. Additionally, the code should use a bounded buffer to read the mask data, and ensure that the data","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer overflow vulnerability, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is caused by the `ImageStream::getImage` method, which reads image data from the stream into a buffer, but does not properly check the size of the buffer before writing to it. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large image, which will cause the `ImageStream::getImage` method to write data to the buffer beyond its bounds. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To fix the vulnerability, the `ImageStream::getImage` method should be modified to properly check the size of the buffer before writing to it. This can be done by using the `std::vector` class to store the image data, and checking the size of the vector before writing to it.

The code is a C++ function that initializes a SplashBitmap object with a given width, height, and color mode. It allocates memory for the bitmap data and initializes the alpha channel if necessary. The function does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to buffer overflows or other security issues.

However, it is possible that the function could be vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack if the input values are not properly validated. For example, if the width or height are negative or if the color mode is not one of the supported values, the function could crash or behave unexpectedly. Additionally, if the input values are not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially exploit the function to cause a DoS attack by providing malicious input values.

Therefore, it is recommended to properly validate and sanitize the input values to prevent potential vulnerabilities.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `atof` function is used to convert the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute to a double value, which can result in a nan value if the attribute is not a valid floating-point number. The nan value is then used in the calculation of the `m_refreshDelayFactor` variable, which is then used in the calculation of the `m_minCacheDuration` variable.

The function takes a `const DOMElement*` as a parameter, and then uses `XMLHelper::getFirstChildElement` to get the first child element of the element. This function does not perform any bounds checking on the `e` parameter, and instead assumes that the element is valid.

However, the `XMLHelper::getFirstChildElement` function does not check if the element has any child elements. This means that if the `e` parameter is a valid element, but it does not have any child elements, the function will return a null pointer. This null pointer will then be used as an argument to the `XMLHelper::getAttrBool` function, which will attempt to read the value of the bool attribute from the null pointer. This will cause a buffer overflow, as the function will attempt to read data from an invalid memory location.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted XML document to the function, with a valid element but no child elements.

",1.0,665.0,6.0,1.6504888534545898
177850,DoS Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.

The vulnerability is caused by the `array_to_json_internal` function, which takes a `Datum` value as input and recursively calls itself to convert the array elements to JSON. The function does not perform any bounds checking on the `Datum` value, which means that it can write beyond the end of the allocated memory buffer.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted `Datum` value that contains a large array with many elements. Each element in the array can be a `Datum` value that is also an array, which can lead to a deep recursion that causes the function to write beyond the end of the allocated memory buffer.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted `Datum` value to the `datum_to_json` function, which will then call `array_to_json_internal` with the specially crafted `Datum` value. This will cause the function to write beyond the end of the allocated memory buffer, leading to a buffer overflow attack.

177905,DoS,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a DoS attack. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `upper_bound` function in the `minWastedSpace` function, which can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) attack.

The `upper_bound` function returns an iterator to the first element in the range that is greater than the value provided as the second argument. In the context of the `minWastedSpace` function, this function is used to find the first element in the `box` vector that is greater than the last element in the `packages` vector. If the `box` vector contains a value that is greater than the last element in the `packages` vector, the `upper_bound` function will return an iterator to the end of the `box` vector, which can cause the `minWastedSpace` function to loop indefinitely.

This vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input to the `minWastedSpace` function that causes the `upper_bound` function to return an iterator to the end of the `box` vector. This can cause the `minWastedSpace` function to loop indefinitely, leading to a denial of service (DoS) attack.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses the `splashFloor` function to calculate the index of the line dash pattern, which can lead to an integer overflow if the phase is too large. This can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input that triggers the integer overflow. This can be done by providing a large phase value, which will cause the `splashFloor` function to return an incorrect index. The attacker can then use this incorrect index to access memory outside the bounds of the allocated memory, leading to a buffer overflow or other security vulnerability.

Therefore, it is important to fix this vulnerability by properly validating the input and preventing integer overflows.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `minWastedSpace` function takes a vector of integers as input, and then sorts it. However, the sorting function used is `std::sort`, which is not guaranteed to be stable. This means that the order of equal elements in the vector may be changed after sorting, which can lead to an integer overflow if the largest element in the vector is equal to the largest possible value of the integer type.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to provide a vector of integers with a large number of equal elements, and then a vector of integers with a large number of elements that are all equal to the largest possible value of the integer type. The `minWastedSpace` function will then sort the first vector, and then sort the second vector, which will cause an integer overflow if the largest element in the second vector is equal to the largest possible value of the integer type.

This vulnerability is similar to the one described in CVE-2009-0946, which affects FreeType 2.3.9 and earlier.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
