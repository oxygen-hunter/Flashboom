177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are required to create machine accounts. This allows an attacker to create a machine account with the desired UAC bits set, even if they do not have the necessary rights.

The fix for this vulnerability is to properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts, and to ensure that the required rights are present on the Domain object.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

The code is using the `estrdup` function to allocate memory for the `strbuf` variable, which is a buffer that is used to store the time string. The `estrdup` function is a wrapper around the `malloc` function, which allocates memory from the heap. The memory allocated by `estrdup` is not freed until the `strbuf` variable goes out of scope, which is when the function returns. Therefore, there is no memory leak in this code.

Furthermore, the code is not using any deprecated or insecure functions, such as `gets`, `scanf`, or `strcpy`. It is also not using any unvalidated user inputs, such as in the `atoi` function.

However, the `gmalloc` function does not check for memory allocation failures, and the program will continue to execute with a potentially corrupted heap.

This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, as an attacker can send a crafted PDF file that causes the program to allocate a large amount of memory, leading to a crash. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the system.

Additionally, the `gmalloc` function does not check for buffer overflows, which can also lead to a DoS vulnerability.

Therefore, it is recommended to use a safer memory allocation function, such as `malloc` or `calloc`, which check for memory allocation failures and buffer overflows.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the line length. This means that if the image data is corrupted or malicious, it can cause the `getLine` method to read beyond the end of the line, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially executing arbitrary code.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted PDF file that contains a malicious image with a large line length. The malicious image can be used to cause a buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to a denial of service or other security vulnerabilities.

To fix the vulnerability, the `ImageStream` class should be modified to perform bounds checking on the line length, or a separate bounds checking function should be added to the `ImageStream` class. Additionally, the `drawImage` function should be modified to properly validate the image data and prevent buffer overflows.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses the ImageStream class to read the image data from the input stream. The ImageStream class uses a buffer to store the image data, and the buffer size is determined by the maximum image size. If the image size exceeds the buffer size, the code will read the image data into the buffer, potentially causing a buffer overflow.

177788,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer size of 4096 bytes, which can be overflowed by a crafted PDF file. If the image data exceeds this buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the `imgMaskData.imgStr->reset()` function, which resets the `ImageStream` object to its initial state. However, this function does not check if the buffer size has been exceeded, and it does not reset the buffer size to its initial value. This means that if the image data exceeds the buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to craft a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large image with a large number of pixels. The image data can be crafted to exceed the buffer size of the `ImageStream` object, causing a buffer overflow and potentially executing arbitrary code.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_Load_Glyph` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input glyph index is too large. The function takes an `FT_UInt` parameter, which is an unsigned integer, but the input value is obtained from a signed integer variable `c`. If `c` is negative, the resulting `gid` value will be too large to fit in the `FT_UInt` type, leading to a buffer overflow.

Furthermore, the `FT_Render_Glyph` function also has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability, as it can write to the `slot->bitmap.buffer` array without checking the bounds of the array. This can be exploited to write to the stack or other areas of memory, leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is longer than the buffer, causing the program to write beyond the end of the buffer and potentially overwriting other data on the stack.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strcpy` function, which does not perform any bounds checking. Instead, it blindly copies the source string into the destination buffer, without checking if the source string is too long to fit in the destination buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the source string is longer than the destination buffer, causing the program to write beyond the end of the buffer and potentially overwriting other data on the stack.

177850,DoS Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a DoS_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-5289. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `datum_to_json` function does not properly handle the `key_scalar` parameter, which is used to determine whether the input value is a scalar or not. If the input value is a scalar, the function does not properly escape it, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:

177855,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-5252. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code allows a symlink to point outside of a share, which can bypass intended file-access restrictions. This can be exploited by creating a symlink that points to a file outside of the share, and then accessing the symlink. The code does not properly check the validity of the symlink, which allows an attacker to access files outside of the share.

The vulnerability is in the `check_reduced_name_with_privilege` function, specifically in the `if (SMB_VFS_LSTAT(conn, smb_fname_cwd)!= 0)` block. The `SMB_VFS_LSTAT` function is used to get the stat structure of a file, and the `smb_fname_cwd` variable is used to represent the current working directory. However, the code does not properly check the validity of the `smb_fname_cwd` variable, which allows an attacker to bypass the intended file-access restrictions.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

177856,,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `get_line` reads input from a file and stores it in a buffer, but it does not check the size of the buffer before writing to it. This means that if the input is too large, it will overflow the buffer and cause undefined behavior.

The vulnerability is caused by the `chars_read = get_line ()` line, which reads input from the file and stores it in the `buf` array. However, the function does not check the size of the buffer before writing to it, which means that if the input is too large, it will overflow the buffer and cause undefined behavior.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could provide a specially crafted input file that is larger than the buffer size. This would cause the `get_line` function to overflow the buffer and write data to memory outside of the buffer, potentially leading to a buffer overflow attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the `get_line` function should be modified to check the size of the buffer before writing to it. This can be done by using the `strlen` function to determine the length of the input string, and then checking if the length is greater than the size of the buffer. If the length is greater than the size of the buffer, the function should return an error or exit the program.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input value is too large.

If the input value is too large, the function will return a value that is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input value, but rather a value that is too large to be stored in an integer variable. This can lead to an integer overflow, which can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can provide a specially crafted input value that causes an integer overflow. This can be done by providing a large floating-point number as input to the `splashFloor` function, which will then return a value that is too large to be stored in an integer variable.
