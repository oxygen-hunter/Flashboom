The vulnerability arises from the use of the `fz_try` macro, which catches all exceptions and rethrows them as `FZ_ERROR_TRYLATER`. However, the `fz_rethrow_if` function is used to rethrow the exception only if it is of type `FZ_ERROR_TRYLATER`. This means that if an exception of a different type is thrown, it will not be caught and will propagate to the caller.

Therefore, an attacker can intentionally cause an exception of a different type to be thrown, which will not be caught by the `fz_rethrow_if` function. This can lead to an unhandled exception, which can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the `fz_rethrow_if` function should be modified to catch all exceptions, not just `FZ_ERROR_TRYLATER`. Alternatively, the `fz_try` macro should be replaced with a more robust exception handling mechanism, such as a `try-catch` block.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `shortestPathLength` function, which takes a graph as input and returns the length of the shortest path in the graph. The function uses a dynamic programming approach to compute the shortest path, and it has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a large array to store the intermediate results.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large number of nodes in the graph, causing the `shortestPathLength` function to overflow the buffer and leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

To fix the vulnerability, the `shortestPathLength` function should be modified to use a fixed-size array or a dynamic memory allocation to store the intermediate results, and the buffer size should be properly bounded.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `drawMaskedImage` function, which takes a `maskStr` parameter that is used to create a mask for the image. The `maskStr` parameter is a `Stream` object, which can be used to read data from a file or other input source.

The code then uses the `ImageStream` class to create an `ImageStream` object from the `maskStr` parameter, which is then used to read the mask data. The `ImageStream` object is then used to create a `SplashBitmap` object, which is used to store the mask data.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `ImageStream` object is not properly validated, and can be used to read data from a file or other input source that is not a valid image file. If the `maskStr` parameter is not a valid image file, the `ImageStream` object will read data from the file or other input source, which can cause a buffer overflow or other security vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `drawSoftMaskedImage` function, which takes a `maskStr` parameter that is used to create a soft mask for the image. The function then uses the `ImageStream` class to read the mask data from the stream, and the `SplashOutImageData` struct to store the mask data.

The vulnerability occurs when the `maskStr` parameter contains a crafted PDF file that contains a large number of pixels, which can cause the `ImageStream` class to allocate a large amount of memory to store the mask data. This can lead to a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to create a crafted PDF file that contains a large number of pixels in the mask data, and then pass the crafted PDF file to the `drawSoftMaskedImage` function. The function would then allocate a large amount of memory to store the mask data, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially executing arbitrary code.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_Load_Glyph` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input glyph index is too large. The function takes an `FT_UInt` parameter, which is an unsigned integer, but the code does not perform any bounds checking on the input value.

The function `_XcursorReadImage` reads data from a file and stores it in a `XcursorImage` structure. The structure has several members that are used to store the image data, such as `width`, `height`, `xhot`, `yhot`, and `delay`. The function uses the `XcursorReadUInt` function to read the values of these members from the file.

The `XcursorReadUInt` function reads an unsigned integer from the file and stores it in the `XcursorImage` structure. The function does not perform any bounds checking on the values it reads, so it is possible for the values to overflow the memory allocated for the structure.

However, the function does perform some sanity checks on the values it reads. It checks that the values are less than or equal to 0x10000, which is a reasonable limit for the values of the members of the `XcursorImage` structure. If the values are greater than this limit, the function returns NULL, indicating that the image is invalid.

If the input string is too long, it can cause a buffer overflow, leading to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input string that is longer than the expected length. The `walk_string` function does not check the length of the input string, so it will continue to read from the input buffer until it reaches the end of the buffer, potentially causing a buffer overflow.

To fix the vulnerability, the `walk_string` function should be modified to properly check the length of the input string. This can be done by using the `strlen` function to determine the length of the input string, and then comparing it to the expected length. If the length of the input string is greater than the expected length, the function should return an error.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

The `editor_program` variable is not properly sanitized, which means that an attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the `editor_program` variable.

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `shortestPathLength` function, which takes a vector of vectors as an argument. The function uses a bitwise OR operation to create a new vector that represents the state of the graph, where each bit corresponds to a node in the graph. The function then uses a queue to traverse the graph, and for each node, it checks the state of the graph to determine the shortest path length.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `queue` data structure, which can cause an integer overflow if the queue becomes too large. The `queue` data structure uses a fixed-size array to store the elements, and if the queue becomes too large, the array can overflow, leading to an integer overflow.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to send a specially crafted input to the `shortestPathLength` function that causes the queue to become too large. This can be done by sending a large number of nodes in the graph, which can cause the queue to overflow and lead to an integer overflow.

Therefore, it is recommended to use a safer data structure, such as a linked list, to","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
