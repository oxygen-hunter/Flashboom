177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `isMatch` function, which allows an attacker to bypass the access restrictions by providing a malicious pattern that matches the domain name. The `isMatch` function is used to check if the domain name matches a specific pattern, and if it does, the function returns true. However, the function does not properly check for administrative privileges, which allows an attacker to bypass the access restrictions.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, and they would need to have a malicious pattern that matches the domain name. Once the attacker has access to the domain, they can use the `isMatch` function to bypass the access restrictions and create machine accounts with elevated privileges.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

177783,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `strcpy` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input string is too long. The `strcpy` function copies the input string into a buffer of fixed size, which can lead to an overflow if the input string is longer than the buffer. This can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a long input string that causes the buffer overflow. The attacker can use a variety of techniques to exploit this vulnerability, such as sending a specially crafted PDF file or using a buffer overflow attack to overwrite the return address on the stack.

To fix this vulnerability, the `strcpy` function should be replaced with a safer function that checks the size of the input string before copying it into the buffer.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `*` operator in the `isMatch` function, which allows an attacker to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF file. The `*` operator is used to match any character in the pattern, which can lead to an infinite loop if the pattern is malicious.

For example, if the pattern is `*a`, it will match any string that contains the letter `a`, including strings with a large number of characters. This can cause the application to consume excessive memory and eventually crash.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to craft a malicious PDF file that contains a pattern with a large number of `*` operators. The application would then crash or execute arbitrary code when the pattern is matched.

Therefore, it is important to fix this vulnerability by properly validating the pattern and preventing the use of the `*` operator in the `isMatch` function.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `strcpy` function in the `datum_to_json` function. The `strcpy` function copies the contents of the source string to the destination string, without performing any bounds checking.

177879,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-3456. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `strcpy` function, which can be tricked into overwriting the return address on the stack with a malicious value. This can cause the program to return to a different location in memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is caused by the `isMatch` function, which uses the `strcpy` function to copy a string. The `strcpy` function does not perform any bounds checking, which means that it can write beyond the end of the destination buffer. This can cause the return address on the stack to be overwritten with a malicious value, leading to arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted string to the `isMatch` function, which would cause the return address on the stack to be overwritten with a malicious value. This could potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

It is important to note that this vulnerability is not present in the latest version of QEMU, which has been updated to use a safer version of the `strcpy` function. However,","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177880,Bypass,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability.

The code checks if a file name is permitted by comparing it with a list of permitted file names. The comparison is done using the `string_match` function, which checks if the file name matches the pattern specified in the permission element. The pattern can contain wildcards, such as `*`, `?`, and `.`.

The code also checks if the file name starts with the same number of parent references as the permission element. This is done to prevent a file name from being matched by a permission element that has more parent references than the file name.

The code also checks if the file name is absolute or relative. If the file name is absolute, the permission element must not start with an absolute path. If the file name is relative, the permission element can start with an absolute path.

The code returns an error if the file name is not permitted.

Therefore, the code does not allow arbitrary file system access, and it does not allow a malicious PostScript file to bypass the `.tempfile` restrictions.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

177883,,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The `string_split` function is used to split a string into an array of substrings, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the input string. This means that if the input string is too long, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially lead to a security vulnerability.

The vulnerability is caused by the `string_split` function not checking the length of the input string before allocating memory for the output array. This allows an attacker to provide a long input string that exceeds the allocated memory, causing the program to write beyond the end of the buffer and potentially leading to a security vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, the `string_split` function should be modified to perform bounds checking on the input string before allocating memory for the output array. This can be done by using the `strlen` function to determine the length of the input string and then allocating memory for the output array based on that length.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strcpy` function, which can copy data from one buffer to another, potentially leading to a buffer overflow if the destination buffer is not large enough to hold the data.

The vulnerability is caused by the `strcpy` function being used to copy the contents of the `buf` buffer to the `ctxt->directory` variable. The `buf` buffer is passed as a parameter to the `xmlCreateMemoryParserCtxt` function, which creates a new parser context. The `ctxt->directory` variable is then set to the contents of the `buf` buffer.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashDist` function, which calculates the distance between two points. The function takes two `SplashCoord` arguments, `x0` and `y0`, and returns the distance between them. However, the function does not properly validate the input values, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input values are too large.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input to the `splashDist` function, which can cause the function to write to memory outside the bounds of the allocated buffer. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control of the system.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` and `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macros, which are used to read data from the input stream. However, the code does not properly check the return value of these macros, which can cause the function to read beyond the end of the input stream. This can lead to an integer overflow, which can result in the execution of arbitrary code.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input stream that is longer than the expected length. The overflow can occur in the `for` loop in the `switch` statement, where the code reads the number of glyphs in the range. If the number of glyphs is greater than the expected value, the code can read beyond the end of the input stream, leading to an integer overflow.

To fix the vulnerability, the code should properly check the return value of the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` and `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macros, and handle the case where the input stream is too short. Additionally, the code should use a safer function to read","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177917,Exec Code,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec_Code.

The code does not contain any direct or indirect use of the `system` function, which is a common method for executing shell commands in C++. Therefore, there is no potential for an Exec_Code vulnerability.

However, the code does contain a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `_XReadPad` function, as it reads a variable number of bytes from the network into a buffer without checking the bounds of the buffer. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the number of bytes read exceeds the size of the buffer.

Additionally, the code does not properly validate user input, which could lead to a potential buffer overflow or other vulnerability if user input is not properly sanitized.

Overall, while the code does not contain an Exec_Code vulnerability, it does contain potential buffer overflow and input validation vulnerabilities that should be addressed.","The code contains a Exec_Code vulnerability.

Vulnerability summary:
An issue was discovered in libX11 through 1.6.5. The function XListExtensions in ListExt.c interprets a variable as signed instead of unsigned, resulting in an out-of-bounds write (of up to 128 bytes), leading to DoS or remote code execution.

177918,Exec Code,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `XListExtensions` in ListExt.c interprets a variable as signed instead of unsigned, resulting in an out-of-bounds write (of up to 128 bytes), leading to DoS or remote code execution.

The vulnerability is caused by the `length` variable, which is used to index into the `ch` buffer. The `length` variable is declared as an `int`, which is a signed integer type. However, the `length` variable is used to index into the `ch` buffer, which is an unsigned integer type. This means that the `length` variable can be negative, which can cause the program to access memory outside of the allocated buffer.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted request to the `XListExtensions` function, which can cause the program to write to memory outside of the allocated buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow attack, which can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

The vulnerability is fixed by changing the type of the `length` variable to `unsigned int`, which is the correct type for indexing into the `ch` buffer.","The code contains a Exec_Code vulnerability.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the _XReadPad function, which reads data from the server into a buffer. The buffer is allocated with a size of rlen, which is calculated as rep.length << 2. However, rep.length is not properly validated, and it is possible for the server to send more data than the buffer can hold, leading to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malicious server response with a large value for rep.length, causing the buffer to overflow and potentially leading to a crash or other security issue.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

177922,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strchr` function, which can be tricked into executing arbitrary code by providing a specially crafted input.

The `strchr` function is used to search for a specific character in a string. However, if the character is not found, it returns a pointer to the null character (`\0`). If the null character is then used as a function pointer, it can be executed as a function, leading to arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `strchr` function is used to search for the character `'t'` in the `param_buffer` string. If the character is not found, the function returns a pointer to the null character. This pointer is then used as a function pointer, which can be executed as a function, leading to arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a specially crafted input that contains a string that starts with the character `'t'` followed by a null character. For example, the input `t\0` would cause the function to return a pointer to the null character, which can be executed as a function.

To fix the vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly validate the input and prevent the use of the null character as a function pointer.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
