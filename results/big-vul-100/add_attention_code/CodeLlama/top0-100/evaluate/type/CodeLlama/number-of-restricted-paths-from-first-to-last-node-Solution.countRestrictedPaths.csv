The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are required to create machine accounts. This allows an attacker to create a machine account with the desired UAC bits set, even if they do not have the necessary rights.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC. The attacker can then create a machine account with the desired UAC bits set, which will bypass intended access restrictions.

177783,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gmalloc` function, which allocates memory on the heap. If the memory allocation fails, the program will crash. However, the `gmalloc` function does not check for memory allocation failures, and the program will continue to execute with a potentially large memory allocation. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, as the program may crash or become unresponsive due to the large memory allocation.

Additionally, the `getRGBLine` function does not properly check the input parameters, which can lead to buffer overflows or other vulnerabilities. The function does not check the length of the input buffer, and it does not properly bounds-check the input values. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, including crashes or arbitrary code execution.

Overall, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS Exec Code Overflow vulnerability due to the use of `gmalloc` and the lack of proper input validation.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The `ImageStream` class has a buffer size of 4096 bytes, which can be overflowed by a crafted PDF file. If the image data exceeds this buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the `imgMaskData.imgStr->reset()` function, which resets the `ImageStream` object to its initial state. However, this function does not check if the buffer size has been exceeded, and it does not reset the buffer size to its initial value. This means that if the image data exceeds the buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to craft a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large image with a large number of pixels. The image data can be crafted to exceed the buffer size of the `ImageStream` object, causing a buffer overflow and potentially executing arbitrary code.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ceil` function to calculate the width and height of the output surface. If the input values are large enough, the `ceil` function can overflow, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an arbitrary code execution vulnerability.

The code is vulnerable because it does not perform any bounds checking on the input values, and it relies on the `ceil` function to calculate the width and height of the output surface. If the input values are large enough, the `ceil` function can overflow, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an arbitrary code execution vulnerability.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a crafted PDF file with a large value for the `scale` parameter, which can cause the `ceil` function to overflow and lead to a buffer overflow. This can potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.

Therefore, it is recommended to fix this vulnerability by implementing proper bounds checking on the input values and using a safer function to calculate the width and height of the output surface.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177794,,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a nan vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2017-16853. The CWE-ID is CWE-347.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `atof` function is used to convert the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute to a double value, but the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute is not properly validated. If the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute is not a valid double value, the `atof` function will return a NaN value, which will be assigned to `m_refreshDelayFactor`. This will cause the `m_refreshDelayFactor` variable to contain a NaN value, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

In particular, the `m_refreshDelayFactor` variable is used in a calculation in the `DynamicMetadataProvider` constructor, which is used to determine the refresh delay for the metadata provider. If `m_refreshDelayFactor` contains a NaN value, the calculation will produce an incorrect result, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.

Therefore, it is important to properly validate the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute to ensure that it is a valid double value before using it in the calculation.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

However, the array is not properly bounded, and the function does not check for integer overflows. This means that if the input `n` is large enough, the function can cause a buffer overflow and potentially lead to a security vulnerability.

The vulnerability is caused by the line `adj[u].emplace_back(v, w);`, where `u` and `v` are integers, and `w` is an integer that is added to the array. If `n` is large enough, the sum `u + v` can overflow, leading to an incorrect index into the array. This can cause the function to write to memory outside of the array, potentially leading to a security vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, the function should check for integer overflows before adding elements to the array.

The function `get_line` reads input from a file and stores it in a buffer, but it does not check the size of the buffer before writing to it. This means that if the input is too large, it will overflow the buffer and cause undefined behavior.

The vulnerability is caused by the line `chars_read = get_line ();`. The function `get_line` does not check the size of the buffer before writing to it, so it can overflow the buffer if the input is too large. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, memory corruption, or other security vulnerabilities.

To fix this vulnerability, the function `get_line` should check the size of the buffer before writing to it. This can be done by using the `strlen` function to determine the length of the input, and then checking if the length is greater than the size of the buffer. If the length is greater than the size of the buffer, the function should return an error or truncate the input to fit in the buffer.
