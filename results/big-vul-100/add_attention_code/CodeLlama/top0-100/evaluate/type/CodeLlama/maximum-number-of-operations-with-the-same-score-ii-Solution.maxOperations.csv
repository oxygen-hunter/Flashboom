The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the number of bytes read.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gets` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input string is too large. The `gets` function does not perform any bounds checking, and it does not provide any mechanism for the user to specify the maximum size of the input string. This means that an attacker can potentially overflow the buffer by providing a very large input string, leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the code. The function `drawSoftMaskedImage` takes in a `maskStr` stream, which is then used to create a soft mask for the image. The function then uses the `ImageStream` class to read the mask data from the stream. However, the function does not properly check the size of the mask data, which can lead to an integer overflow if the mask data is too large. This can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large mask data, which can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, as the application may become unresponsive or crash. Additionally, this can also lead to an arbitrary code execution vulnerability, as the application may execute arbitrary code if the mask data is large enough.

To fix this vulnerability, the function should properly check the size of the mask data before reading it from the stream. This can be done by using the `ImageStream::getSize` method to get","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ceil` function to calculate the size of the `cairo_data` buffer. If the `scale` parameter is set to a large value, the `cairo_width` and `cairo_height` variables can become very large, leading to an integer overflow. This can cause the `cairo_rowstride` variable to become too large, leading to a buffer overflow when the `cairo_data` buffer is allocated.

Additionally, the `memset` function is used to initialize the `cairo_data` buffer with a specific value. If the `transparent` parameter is set to `true`, the buffer is initialized with all zeros, which can lead to a vulnerability if the `cairo_data` buffer is not properly initialized.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large scale parameter, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially arbitrary code execution.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the calculation of the rowSize variable. If the width or height of the bitmap is large enough, the calculation can result in an integer overflow, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an executable code overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code.

177850,DoS Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a DoS_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-5289. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `datum_to_json` function does not properly handle the case where the input `val` is a `text` value that contains a large number of characters. The function uses the `OidOutputFunctionCall` function to convert the `val` to a string, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is too large.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted `text` value as the `val` parameter to the `datum_to_json` function. The `text` value should contain a large number of characters, and the attacker should ensure that the `key_scalar` parameter is set to `true`. This will cause the `datum_to_json` function to call the `escape_json` function, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `datum_to_json` function should be modified to properly handle large input strings. One way to do this is to use the `text_to_cstring` function to convert the `text` value to a C string, and","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code checks the stat value of the parent directory before checking if the current directory is below the connect path. This means that an attacker can create a symlink to a directory outside of the share, and then create a symlink to the symlink inside the share.

The function `get_line` reads input from a file and stores it in a buffer, but it does not check the size of the buffer before writing to it. This means that if the input is too large, it will overflow the buffer and cause undefined behavior.

The vulnerability is caused by the `chars_read = get_line ()` line, which reads input from the file and stores it in the `buf` array. However, the function does not check the size of the buffer before writing to it, which means that if the input is too large, it will overflow the buffer and cause undefined behavior.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could provide a specially crafted input file that is larger than the buffer size. This would cause the `get_line` function to overflow the buffer and write data to memory outside of the buffer, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input value is too large.

If the input value is too large, the function will return a value that is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input value, but rather a value that is too large to be stored in an integer variable. This can lead to an integer overflow, which can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can provide a specially crafted input value that causes an integer overflow. The input value can be a large floating-point number that is close to an integer, but not an integer itself. The `splashFloor` function will return a value that is too large to be stored in an integer variable, leading to an integer overflow.

177922,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strcpy` function, which can copy more characters than the destination buffer can hold. This can lead to an overflow, which can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a specially crafted input that causes the `strcpy` function to copy more characters than the destination buffer can hold. This can be done by providing a long string that is longer than the destination buffer, and the `strcpy` function will copy the extra characters, leading to an overflow.

The vulnerability is in the `add_param_to_argv` function, which uses the `strcpy` function to copy a string to a buffer. The buffer is defined as `param_buffer[1024]`, which means it can hold up to 1024 characters. However, the `strcpy` function does not check the size of the destination buffer before copying the string, which means it can copy more characters than the buffer can hold. This can lead to an overflow, which can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the `strcpy` function should be replaced with a safer function that checks the size of the destination buffer before copying the string. Alternatively, the buffer size should be increased","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
