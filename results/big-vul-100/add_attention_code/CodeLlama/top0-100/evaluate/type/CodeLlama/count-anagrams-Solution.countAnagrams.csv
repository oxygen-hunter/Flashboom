177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are necessary to create machine accounts. This allows an attacker to create machine accounts with the desired access rights, bypassing the intended access restrictions.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, and who can create machine accounts with the desired access rights.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `fz_try` macro, which catches all exceptions and rethrows them as `FZ_ERROR_TRYLATER`. However, the `fz_rethrow_if` function is used to check if the exception is `FZ_ERROR_TRYLATER`, and if so, it ignores the error and continues execution. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by repeatedly triggering the `FZ_ERROR_TRYLATER` exception.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted PDF file to the application, which would cause the `fz_rethrow_if` function to repeatedly trigger the `FZ_ERROR_TRYLATER` exception. This would cause the application to consume excessive resources and eventually crash or become unresponsive.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input stream contains a malicious PDF file. The `ImageStream` class uses a fixed-size buffer to read data from the input stream, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input stream contains more data than the buffer can hold. This can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the `drawMaskedImage` function, which uses the `ImageStream` class to read data from the input stream. The function does not properly check the size of the input stream, which can lead to a buffer overflow. Additionally, the function does not properly validate the input data, which can lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a malicious PDF file that contains a large amount of data in the image stream. The attacker can use a specially crafted PDF file to cause a buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, as the application may crash or become unresponsive.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer of a fixed size, and if the image data exceeds this buffer, it can cause a buffer overflow. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, including code that can cause a denial of service or other types of vulnerabilities.

The vulnerability is caused by the `imgMaskData.imgStr = new ImageStream(maskStr, maskWidth, maskColorMap->getNumPixelComps(), maskColorMap->getBits());` line, which creates a new `ImageStream` object with a buffer size that is dependent on the size of the image data. If the image data exceeds this buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow, leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a crafted PDF file with a large image that exceeds the buffer size of the `ImageStream` class.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_Load_Glyph` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input glyph ID is too large. The function takes an `FT_UInt` parameter, which is an unsigned integer type, and the input glyph ID is converted to this type before being passed to the function. However, the function does not perform any bounds checking on this parameter, which means that an attacker can potentially overflow the buffer by providing a large glyph ID.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a crafted PDF file with a large glyph ID, which would cause the `FT_Load_Glyph` function to overflow the buffer and potentially execute arbitrary code. This could potentially lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, as the application may crash or behave unexpectedly.

This means that if the input string is longer than the buffer allocated for it, it will cause a buffer overflow, leading to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check the length of the input string before copying it into the buffer. This allows an attacker to provide a string that is longer than the buffer, causing the function to write beyond the end of the buffer. The buffer overflow can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or cause a crash, depending on the context in which the function is used.

To fix the vulnerability, the function should perform bounds checking on the input string before copying it into the buffer. This can be done by using the `strlen` function to determine the length of the input string, and then checking that the length is less than the size of the buffer. If the length is greater than the size of the buffer, the function should return an error or take some other appropriate action.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to create symlinks on the system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have write access to the share directory, and then create a symlink to a directory outside of the share.

The code is a C++ function that parses an XML file using the libxml2 library. It does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, or memory leaks.

However, the code does use the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` function, which can be used to parse XML files from the file system. This can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if the XML file contains malicious data, such as an XML external entity declaration.

To mitigate this risk, the code sets the `PG(allow_url_fopen)` flag to 1, which disables the ability to load XML files from the file system. This is a good practice to follow to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

Overall, the code is not vulnerable to any security vulnerabilities, but it is important to follow best practices when using the libxml2 library to ensure that the code is secure and reliable.","The code contains a +Info vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input number is too large.

If the input number is too large, the function will return a value that is not within the valid range of the integer type, leading to an integer overflow. This can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code, depending on the specific implementation.

In this case, the vulnerability can be exploited by providing a large floating-point number as input to the `splashFloor` function, which will cause an integer overflow and potentially lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_READ_USHORT()` function, which reads a 16-bit value from the input stream. If the value is greater than 65535, it will overflow and wrap around to a negative value. This can lead to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is triggered by providing a large value in the `offset` parameter, which is then used to access memory outside the allocated buffer. The `FT_READ_USHORT()` function is called multiple times, each time with a potentially overflowed value, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input that causes the `offset` parameter to overflow. This can be done by providing a large value in the `offset` parameter, which will cause the `FT_READ_USHORT()` function to read memory outside the allocated buffer.

The vulnerability is fixed in FreeType 2.4.0 and later versions.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177922,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2019-11360. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `strcpy` function, which copies the contents of the `parsestart` pointer to the `param_buffer` array without any bounds checking. This means that if the `parsestart` pointer points to a buffer that is larger than the `param_buffer` array, the `strcpy` function will copy data from the source buffer into the destination buffer, potentially overflowing the destination buffer. This can lead to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

To fix this vulnerability, the `strcpy` function should be replaced with a safer function such as `strncpy` or `strlcpy`, which allows the caller to specify the maximum number of characters to copy. Alternatively, bounds checking can be added to the `strcpy` function to ensure that the source buffer is not larger than the destination buffer.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
