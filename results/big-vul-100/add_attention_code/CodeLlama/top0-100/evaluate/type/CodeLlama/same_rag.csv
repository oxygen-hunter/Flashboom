The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gmalloc` function, which allocates memory using the `malloc` function. If the `malloc` function fails to allocate memory, it returns a null pointer, which can be used to execute arbitrary code.

This can potentially execute arbitrary code, leading to a denial of service or remote code execution.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `length` variable in the `for` loop, which is not properly bounded. The `length` variable is used to determine the number of iterations in the loop, but it is not checked for overflow. If the `length` variable is large enough, it can cause the loop to iterate beyond the bounds of the input array, leading to a buffer overflow.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a malicious PDF file that contains a large value for the `length` variable. This can cause the function to write to memory outside the allocated bounds, leading to a buffer overflow. The attacker can then use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code, leading to a denial of service or remote","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the ImageStream class, which can cause integer overflows when processing large PDF files. The code allocates memory for the image data and then processes it, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the image data is too large. This can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is related to the following functions:

* ImageStream::getImage()
* ImageStream::getMaskImage()
* ImageStream::getImageMask()

These functions are used to read image data from a PDF file and process it. They use the ImageStream::getImage() function to read the image data and then process it. However, the ImageStream::getImage() function does not perform any bounds checking on the image data, which can lead to integer overflows if the image data is too large.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to send a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large image. The image data is then processed by the ImageStream::getImage() function, which can lead to a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the calculation of the rowSize variable. The rowSize variable is calculated as follows:

rowSize = (width + 7) >> 3;

This calculation can overflow if the width variable is large enough. For example, if width is 2^31 - 1, the calculation will result in a value of 2^31 - 1 + 7 = 2^31, which is greater than the maximum value that can be stored in an integer. This can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a crafted PDF file with a large value for the width variable. The attacker can use a tool such as the ""pdf-parser"" tool to create a malicious PDF file with a large width value. Once the PDF file is processed by the application, the integer overflow can occur, leading to a DoS Exec Code Overflow vulnerability.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the code. The function takes in an integer variable 'c' as an input, and uses it to index into an array. However, the array is not properly bounds-checked, which allows an attacker to provide an out-of-bounds index, leading to a buffer overflow. The overflow can cause the function to write to memory locations outside of the allocated buffer, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `m_refreshDelayFactor` variable is initialized with the value of the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute from the XML element, which is obtained using the `XMLHelper::getAttrString` function. However, this function does not perform any validation on the input string, and it is possible for the input string to contain a nan value. If the input string contains a nan value, the `atof` function will return a nan value, which will be assigned to the `m_refreshDelayFactor` variable.

This can lead to a situation where the `m_refreshDelayFactor` variable is set to a nan value, which can cause problems in the code that uses this variable. For example, if the variable is used in a calculation, the result will be nan, which can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should perform proper validation on the input string to ensure that it does not contain a nan value.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strchr_m` function, which is used to find the first occurrence of the character '\\' in the `sharename` string. However, the `strchr_m` function does not check if the character '\\' is present in the string, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the `sharename` string is not properly null-terminated.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted `sharename` string that contains a large number of characters, including the character '\\', but not properly null-terminated. This can cause the `strchr_m` function to return a pointer to a location in memory that is not part of the `sharename` string, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially other vulnerabilities.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `lex_expect` function, which expects a specific token type (in this case, `JSON_TOKEN_OBJECT_START`) and consumes the token from the input stream. However, if the token is not present in the input stream, the function will consume all remaining tokens until it finds a token of the expected type, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.

This vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted JSON input that contains a large number of tokens, with the last token being a valid token of the expected type. The function will consume all the tokens until it reaches the last token, leading to a buffer overflow.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `lex_expect` function should be modified to check for the presence of the expected token before consuming it from the input stream.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_READ_USHORT()` function, which can cause an integer overflow if the value read from the stream exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a `FT_UShort` variable. This can happen if the `offset` parameter is set to a value that is greater than the maximum value that can be stored in a `FT_UShort` variable, which is 65535.

177927,,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The vulnerability is in the `EVP_SealUpdate` function, which takes a `data` parameter of type `unsigned char *` and a `data_len` parameter of type `size_t`. The `data_len` parameter is not properly validated, which allows an attacker to provide a large value for `data_len` that exceeds the size of the `buf` array, leading to a buffer overflow. This can cause the program to write data to memory outside of the allocated buffer, potentially leading to a crash or other security vulnerability.","The code contains a nan vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2017-11144. The CWE-ID is CWE-754.
Vulnerability summary:
In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, the openssl extension PEM sealing code did not check the return value of the OpenSSL sealing function, which could lead to a crash of the PHP interpreter, related to an interpretation conflict for a negative number in ext/openssl/openssl.c, and an OpenSSL documentation omission.
