177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are necessary to set the UF_SERVER_TRUST_ACCOUNT and UF_PARTIAL_SECRETS_ACCOUNT bits in the userAccountControl attribute. This allows an attacker to create a machine account with these bits set, even if they do not have the necessary rights.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC. The attacker can then use the created machine account to bypass intended access restrictions, such as access control lists (ACLs) or file permissions. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or system resources.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

The code is using the `estrdup` function to allocate memory for the `strbuf` variable, which is a string buffer that is used to store the time string. The `estrdup` function is a wrapper around the `malloc` function, which allocates memory from the heap. The memory allocated by `estrdup` is not freed until the `strbuf` variable goes out of scope, which is when the function returns. Therefore, there is no memory leak in this code.

177787,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer size of 4096 bytes, which can be overflowed by a crafted PDF file. If the image data exceeds this buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the `drawMaskedImage` function, which takes a `Stream` object as input and reads the image data from it. The `ImageStream` class is used to read the image data, and the buffer size is set to 4096 bytes. However, the `ImageStream` class does not perform any bounds checking on the buffer size, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PDF file that contains a large image with a malicious payload. The malicious payload can be executed by the `ImageStream` class, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

To fix this vulnerability, the `ImageStream` class should perform bounds checking on the buffer size to prevent","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177788,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer of a fixed size, and if the image data exceeds this buffer, it can cause a buffer overflow. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, including code that can cause a denial of service or other types of vulnerabilities.

The vulnerability is caused by the `imgMaskData.imgStr = new ImageStream(maskStr, maskWidth, maskColorMap->getNumPixelComps(), maskColorMap->getBits());` line, which creates a new `ImageStream` object with a buffer size that is dependent on the image data. If the image data exceeds this buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a crafted PDF file with a large image that exceeds the buffer size of the `ImageStream` class. This can be done by sending a malicious PDF file that contains a large image with a high number of pixels, which can cause a buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The `imgCoordMungeLowerC` function takes a `SplashCoord` as input and returns a `int` value. The `imgCoordMungeUpperC` function takes a `SplashCoord` as input and returns a `int` value. Both functions are used to calculate the minimum and maximum values of a coordinate, respectively.

The vulnerability arises when an attacker provides a malicious input to these functions, causing a buffer overflow. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a large input value that exceeds the size of the buffer used to store the coordinate values. This can cause the program to write beyond the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input to the `imgCoordMungeLowerC` or `imgCoordMungeUpperC` function, causing the program to write beyond the end of the buffer and overwrite other memory locations.

177906,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input value is too large.

If the input value is too large, the function will return a value that is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input value, but rather a value that is too large to be stored in an integer variable. This can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

For example, if the input value is 1.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` and `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macros, which are used to read data from the input stream. However, these macros do not perform any bounds checking on the input data, which can lead to buffer overflows if the input data is malicious.

In the given code, the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` macro is used to read a large amount of data from the input stream, which can potentially overflow the buffer allocated for the data. Similarly, the `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macro is used to read more data from the input stream, which can also potentially overflow the buffer.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a malicious input that contains a large amount of data, which can overflow the buffer and cause the program to execute arbitrary code. This can lead to code execution vulnerabilities, which can be used to gain unauthorized access to the system or steal sensitive data.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that the input data is properly validated and sanitized to prevent buffer overflows","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
