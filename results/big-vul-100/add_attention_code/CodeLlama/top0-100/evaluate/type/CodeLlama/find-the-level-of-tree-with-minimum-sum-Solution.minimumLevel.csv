177783,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the `getRGBLine` function. The function takes an input `length` of type `int` and uses it to calculate the size of the `tmp_line` array. However, the `length` variable is not properly validated, which allows an attacker to provide a large value that can cause an integer overflow. This can lead to a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is further exacerbated by the fact that the `getRGBLine` function is used in a multi-threaded environment, which can lead to race conditions and other security issues.

To fix the vulnerability, the `length` variable should be properly validated to ensure that it is within a reasonable range. Additionally, the function should be rewritten to use safer data types and avoid integer overflows.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the code. The function takes in a crafted PDF file, which can cause the integer overflows to occur, leading to a denial of service or potentially executing arbitrary code.

The integer overflows occur in the following lines of code:
```
imgData.width = width;
imgData.height = height;
```
These lines of code set the width and height of the image to the given values. However, if the values are too large, they can cause an integer overflow, leading to a crash or potentially executing arbitrary code.

Furthermore, the code also uses the `mat` array to store the transformation matrix, which can also cause integer overflows if the values are too large.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the values of `width` and `height` are validated and sanitized before being used. Additionally, the code should also ensure that the `mat` array is properly initialized and validated to prevent integer overflows.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the code. The function `drawMaskedImage` takes in a `maskWidth` and `maskHeight` as input, and then uses these values to allocate memory for a `SplashBitmap` object. However, the code does not perform any bounds checking on these values, which can lead to integer overflows if the values are too large.

For example, if `maskWidth` is set to a very large value, the code will allocate a large amount of memory for the `SplashBitmap` object, which can lead to a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code. Similarly, if `maskHeight` is set to a very large value, the code will allocate a large amount of memory for the `SplashBitmap` object, which can also lead to a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the ImageStream class, which can cause an integer overflow when reading a crafted PDF file. This can lead to a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
imgData.imgStr = new ImageStream(str, width,
                                colorMap->getNumPixelComps(),
                                colorMap->getBits());
```
The ImageStream class uses the width and bits parameters to allocate memory for the image data. If the width or bits parameters are too large, it can cause an integer overflow, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to craft a specially crafted PDF file that can cause the ImageStream class to allocate a large amount of memory. This can be done by using a specially crafted image file that has a large width or bits parameter.

To fix this vulnerability, the ImageStream class should be modified to check for integer overflows and handle them properly. Additionally, the code should be audited for other potential vulnerabilities,","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly handle unspecified vectors, which can lead to a stack-based buffer overflow. This can cause the server to crash, leading to a denial of service.

The vulnerability is present in the `datum_to_json` function, which takes a `StringInfo` object as input and appends the output to it. The function uses the `appendStringInfoString` function to append the output, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the output is too large.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted input to the `datum_to_json` function, which can cause the buffer to overflow and crash the server. This can be done by sending a large input that exceeds the size of the buffer, causing the buffer to overflow and crash the server.

The vulnerability arises from the use of unspecified vectors to manipulate the stack-based buffer overflows in the json parsing code. The code does not properly handle these vectors, which can lead to a denial of service (server crash) if an attacker can exploit the vulnerability.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `JsonbIteratorNext` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if an attacker can manipulate the input data to the function. The function does not properly check the input data, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input data is too large.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input to the `JsonbIteratorNext` function, which can cause a buffer overflow and a denial of service. The attacker can manipulate the input data to cause the buffer overflow, which can lead to a server crash.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input value is too large.

If the input value is too large, the function will return a value that is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input value, but rather a value that is too large to be represented by the integer type. This can cause the loop to run indefinitely, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted input that causes the `splashFloor` function to return a value that is too large, leading to an infinite loop. This can cause the application to crash or become unresponsive, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strcpy` function, which can copy more characters than the destination buffer can hold. This can lead to an overflow, which can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the `strcpy` function, which can copy more characters than the destination buffer can hold. This can lead to an overflow, which can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

The code is vulnerable because it does not check the size of the destination buffer before copying data into it. This means that the `strcpy` function can copy more characters than the buffer can hold, leading to an overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the size of the destination buffer before copying data into it. This can be done by using the `strlen` function to determine the size of the destination buffer, and then using the `strncpy` function to copy data into the buffer, making sure to only copy the number of characters that fit in the buffer.

Additionally, the code should also check for null pointers before dereferencing them, as this can also lead to a buffer overflow.

177923,Bypass,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability. The code checks the input parameters for nullptr before using them, and it also checks the return value of the VCWD_RENAME function to determine if the move was successful. Additionally, the code uses the php_check_open_basedir function to check if the new path is within the open_basedir, and it also uses the php_copy_file_ex function to copy the file if the rename fails.

Therefore, the code does not have any vulnerabilities related to bypassing security checks.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-2348. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.
Vulnerability summary:
The move_uploaded_file implementation in ext/standard/basic_functions.c in PHP before 5.4.39, 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 truncates a pathname upon encountering a \x00 character, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended extension restrictions and create files with unexpected names via a crafted second argument.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-7243.

177926,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code is a function that takes a GstTagList pointer, a base64-encoded image data string, and a base64 length as input, and it returns a GstBuffer pointer. The function first allocates memory for the decoded image data using g_try_malloc0, and then decodes the base64-encoded image data using g_base64_decode_step. If the decoding fails, the function returns NULL.

There is no evidence of any integer overflow or other vulnerability in the code. The function does not appear to have any buffer overflow vulnerabilities, as it does not involve any user-supplied data or any arithmetic operations that could lead to buffer overflows.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0586. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.
Vulnerability summary:
Integer overflow in the gst_vorbis_tag_add_coverart function (gst-libs/gst/tag/gstvorbistag.c) in vorbistag in gst-plugins-base (aka gstreamer-plugins-base) before 0.10.23 in GStreamer allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted COVERART tag that is converted from a base64 representation, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.

177927,,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a nan vulnerability. The code is a C++ function that implements the OpenSSL sealing algorithm for encrypting data using public keys. It does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to nan values.","The code contains a nan vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2017-11144. The CWE-ID is CWE-754.
Vulnerability summary:
In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, the openssl extension PEM sealing code did not check the return value of the OpenSSL sealing function, which could lead to a crash of the PHP interpreter, related to an interpretation conflict for a negative number in ext/openssl/openssl.c, and an OpenSSL documentation omission.
