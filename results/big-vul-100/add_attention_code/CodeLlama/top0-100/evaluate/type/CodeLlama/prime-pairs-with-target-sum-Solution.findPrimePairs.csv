177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are required to create machine accounts. This allows an attacker to create a machine account with the desired userAccountControl value, even if they do not have the necessary rights.

The fix for this vulnerability is to properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts, and to ensure that the required rights are present on the Domain object.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

The code is a C++ function that takes two arguments: `dir` and `manifest`. It appears to be a part of a phar (PHP Archive) implementation. The function is responsible for creating a directory stream for a phar file.

The code checks if the directory name is a valid directory in the phar file. It then iterates over the manifest (a hash table) and adds the entries to the directory stream.

The code does not appear to have any vulnerabilities related to buffer overflow, use after free, memory leaks, integer overflow/underflow, null pointer dereference, improper input validation, race conditions, insecure function usage, insecure resource management, or improper error handling.

However, the code does have a potential vulnerability related to the use of the `strncpy` function. The `strncpy` function is used to copy the directory name into a new buffer, but it does not guarantee that the resulting buffer is null-terminated. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the directory name is too long.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should use the `strlcpy` function instead of `strncpy`. The `strlcpy` function ensures that the resulting buffer is null-terminated.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the code. The function takes an integer input 'n' and performs various operations on it, including multiplication, addition, and subtraction. If the input 'n' is large enough, these operations can result in integer overflows, leading to incorrect calculations and potentially exploitable code execution.

For example, consider the line 'j = (int)(decodeLow[0] + (i * decodeRange[0]) / maxPixel + 0.5);'. If 'decodeLow[0]' is a large negative number and 'decodeRange[0]' is a large positive number, the expression '(i * decodeRange[0]) / maxPixel' can result in an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect calculation of 'j'. This can cause the function to return incorrect results, potentially leading to a denial-of-service or code execution vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gmalloc` function, which allocates memory for the `tmp_line` variable. The `gmalloc` function does not perform any bounds checking on the allocated memory, which means that the `tmp_line` variable can overflow and cause a buffer overflow.

The `tmp_line` variable is used to store the result of the `byte_lookup` function, which is a lookup table that maps input values to output values. The `byte_lookup` function is called multiple times in the `getGrayLine` function, and the `tmp_line` variable is used to store the intermediate results.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the line length. This means that if the image data is corrupted or malicious, it can cause the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file that contains a malicious image with a large number of pixels, causing the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the buffer and overflow into the surrounding memory. This can lead to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability, as the malicious code can be executed in the context of the application.

To fix the vulnerability, the `ImageStream` class should be modified to perform bounds checking on the line length, or a separate bounds checking function should be added to the `ImageStream` class. Additionally, the `drawImage`","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gmalloc` function, which allocates memory for the `data` and `alpha` arrays. The `gmalloc` function uses a fixed-size buffer to allocate memory, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the allocated memory exceeds the maximum size of the buffer.

In the given code, the `rowSize` variable is calculated using the `width` and `height` variables, which can lead to an integer overflow if the product of `width` and `height` exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by an integer. This can cause the `rowSize` variable to become a very large value, leading to a buffer overflow when the `data` and `alpha` arrays are allocated.

Furthermore, the `rowSize` variable is then used to calculate the offset of the `data` and `alpha` arrays in the `SplashBitmap` object. If the `rowSize` variable is very large, this can cause the `data` and `alpha` arrays to be allocated at a very large offset, leading to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the FT_Load_Glyph function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input glyph index is too large. The function takes an FT_UInt as input, which is an unsigned integer type. However, the function does not perform any bounds checking on the input value, which means that an attacker can potentially overflow the buffer by providing a large value for the glyph index.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `findPrimePairs` function uses a linear sieve of Eratosthenes to find prime pairs, which has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n). However, the function also uses a vector to store the prime numbers, which has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n). This means that the total time complexity of the function is O(n^2), which can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability if the input size is large enough.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the function can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm to find prime pairs, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which has a time complexity of O(n log log n) and a space complexity of O(n). Alternatively, the function can be modified to use a more efficient data structure to store the prime numbers, such as a bit vector, which has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n/8), where n is the number of prime pairs to be found.","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `setPath` function does not properly handle the `WJB_BEGIN_ARRAY` and `WJB_BEGIN_OBJECT` cases, which can lead to a stack-based buffer overflow. The `setPathArray` and `setPathObject` functions are called recursively, and the `JsonbIteratorNext` function is used to iterate over the JSON data.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted JSON payload that causes the `setPath` function to recurse too deeply, leading to a stack overflow. This can be done by sending a JSON payload with a large number of nested arrays or objects, which can cause the `setPath` function to recurse too deeply and overflow the stack.

The function then uses the `float_params` function to read the operand stack elements as floating-point numbers, and then uses the `get_space_object` function to retrieve a pointer to the color space object.

The `imgCoordMungeLowerC` function takes a `SplashCoord` value as input and returns the lower coordinate of the corresponding image rectangle. The `imgCoordMungeUpperC` function takes a `SplashCoord` value as input and returns the upper coordinate of the corresponding image rectangle.

The vulnerability arises when an attacker provides a malicious input value to these functions, causing the buffer to overflow. This can be done by providing a large value for the `SplashCoord` parameter, which can cause the buffer to be overwritten with arbitrary data.

The attacker can then use this arbitrary data to execute arbitrary code, leading to a denial of service (DoS) attack.
