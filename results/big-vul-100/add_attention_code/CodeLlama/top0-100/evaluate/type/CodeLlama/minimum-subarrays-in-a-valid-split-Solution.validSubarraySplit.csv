177783,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gmalloc` function, which allocates memory dynamically. If the memory allocation fails, the program will crash, leading to a denial of service. Additionally, the `gfree` function is used to free the memory allocated by `gmalloc`, but it is not checked if the memory has already been freed. This can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability, where the program can access memory that has already been freed, leading to arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large number of elements, causing the program to allocate a large amount of memory and eventually crashing the program. This can lead to a denial of service attack, where the attacker can make the program crash and become unavailable to users.

To fix the vulnerability, the program should check if the memory has already been freed before freeing it again. Additionally, the program should handle the case where the memory allocation fails, and return an error message to the user instead of crashing the program.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gcd` function, which takes two integers as input and returns their greatest common divisor. The function is used in a loop to check if the input integers are coprime, and if they are not, the loop continues until the input integers are coprime. However, the loop does not have a termination condition, which means that it can run indefinitely if the input integers are not coprime.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted input that causes the loop to run indefinitely, leading to a denial of service (DoS) or potentially an execution of arbitrary code. This can be done by providing two large prime numbers as input, which will cause the loop to run indefinitely.

To fix this vulnerability, a termination condition should be added to the loop to ensure that it terminates when the input integers are coprime.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `drawMaskedImage` function, which takes a `Stream` object as input and processes it in a way that can lead to a buffer overflow. The function first reads the `maskStr` stream and then uses the `ImageStream` class to read the `str` stream. The `ImageStream` class uses a `SplashBitmap` object to store the image data, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the image data is too large.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large image that is not properly bounded. The attacker can use a buffer overflow attack to overwrite the return address on the stack with the address of a malicious function, which can then be executed when the `drawMaskedImage` function returns. This can lead to arbitrary code execution and a potential denial of service.

To fix the vulnerability, the `drawMaskedImage` function should be modified to properly bound the image data and to check for buffer overflows. Additionally, the `ImageStream` class should be modified to properly handle large image data and to prevent buffer overflows.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer of a fixed size, and it can cause a buffer overflow if the image data is larger than the buffer size. This can lead to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large image that exceeds the buffer size of the `ImageStream` class. The attacker can then cause the program to read beyond the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the FT_Load_Glyph function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input glyph index is too large. The function takes an FT_UInt as input, which is an unsigned integer type. However, the function does not perform any bounds checking on the input value, which means that an attacker can potentially overflow the buffer by providing a large value for the gid variable.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `atof` function is used to convert the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute to a double value, but the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute is not properly validated. If the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute is not a valid double value, the `atof` function will return a NaN value, which will be assigned to `m_refreshDelayFactor`. This will cause the `m_refreshDelayFactor` to be set to a NaN value, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

In particular, the `m_refreshDelayFactor` value is used in a calculation in the `DynamicMetadataProvider` constructor, which determines the minimum cache duration. If `m_refreshDelayFactor` is a NaN value, the minimum cache duration will be set to a very large value, which can lead to performance issues and other vulnerabilities.

Therefore, it is recommended to properly validate the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute and ensure that it is a valid double value before using it in the calculation.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

177887,DoS Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to any security vulnerabilities.

The code is a function that allocates memory for a byte array and returns a pointer to the allocated memory. It takes three arguments: a pointer to a memory object, the size of the memory block to be allocated, and a client name. The function uses the Memento_label function to label the allocated memory block with the client name. It then checks if the allocated memory block exceeds the limit set for the memory object, and if it does, it sets the message to ""exceeded limit"". If the allocated memory block does not exceed the limit, it checks if the memory block can be allocated, and if it can, it sets the message to ""OK"". Finally, it returns the pointer to the allocated memory block.

The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to security. It does not contain any buffer overflows, use after free errors, memory leaks, integer overflows, null pointer dereferences, improper input validation, race conditions, insecure function usage, insecure resource management, improper error handling, cryptographic issues, or sensitive data exposure.

The code is a C++ function that parses an XML file using the libxml2 library. It does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, or memory leaks.

However, the code does use the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` function, which can be used to parse XML files from the file system. This can potentially lead to a security vulnerability if the XML file contains malicious data, such as an XML external entity declaration.

To mitigate this risk, the code sets the `PG(allow_url_fopen)` flag to `1`, which allows the parser to read XML files from the file system. However, this flag is not properly reset to its original value after the parser is created, which could potentially lead to a security vulnerability if the XML file contains malicious data.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly reset the `PG(allow_url_fopen)` flag to its original value after the parser is created. This can be done by adding a `PG(allow_url_fopen) = old_allow_url_fopen;` statement after the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` function call.

177906,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashDist` function, which calculates the distance between two points. The function takes two `SplashCoord` arguments, `x0` and `y0`, and returns the distance between them. However, the function does not properly validate the input values, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input values are too large.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input to the `splashDist` function, which causes the function to write to memory outside the allocated buffer. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control of the system.

To fix the vulnerability, the `splashDist` function should properly validate the input values to prevent buffer overflows.
