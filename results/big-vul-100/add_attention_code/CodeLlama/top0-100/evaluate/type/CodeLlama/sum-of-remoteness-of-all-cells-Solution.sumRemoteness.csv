The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The function uses a hardcoded list of GUIDs to check for specific user account control flags, but it does not properly check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended access restrictions and create machine accounts with the desired user account control flags.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC. The attacker can then use the hardcoded GUIDs to create machine accounts with the desired user account control flags, which can bypass intended access restrictions.

The vulnerability can be mitigated by properly checking for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object. This can be done by using the appropriate LDAP filters to check for the presence of the required rights, or by using the appropriate","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the code. The function `GfxImageColorMap::GfxImageColorMap` takes an integer `bitsA` as input, which is used to determine the maximum value of a pixel.

For example, if `bitsA` is set to a large value, such as 32, the maximum pixel value will be 2^32 - 1, which is a very large number. If the `decodeLow` and `decodeRange` arrays are also set to large values, the pixel values can become very large as well, leading to integer overflows.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream and returns it as a `SplashColorPtr`. The `SplashColorPtr` is then used to draw the image on the screen.

The vulnerability occurs when the `ImageStream` class is used to read a large image file, which can cause the `getLine` method to read more data from the stream than the buffer size. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to send a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large image. The image data is read from the stream using the `ImageStream` class, which can cause a buffer overflow. This can be done by sending a crafted PDF file that contains a large image with a malicious payload, which can be executed when the image is drawn on the screen.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `ImageStream","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177787,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the code. The function `drawMaskedImage` takes in a `maskWidth` and `maskHeight` as input, and then uses these values to create a new `SplashBitmap` object. However, the code does not properly check for integer overflows when calculating the size of the new `SplashBitmap` object. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can potentially execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a malicious PDF file that contains a large `maskWidth` and `maskHeight` value, leading to the creation of a large `SplashBitmap` object. This object can then be used to execute arbitrary code by exploiting the buffer overflow.

Therefore, it is important to properly check for integer overflows in the code to prevent this vulnerability.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer of a fixed size, and if the image data exceeds this buffer, it can cause a buffer overflow. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, including code that can cause a denial of service or other types of vulnerabilities.

The vulnerability is caused by the `imgMaskData.imgStr = new ImageStream(maskStr, maskWidth, maskColorMap->getNumPixelComps(), maskColorMap->getBits());` line, which creates a new `ImageStream` object with a buffer size that is dependent on the image data. If the image data exceeds this buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow, leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large image with a large number of pixels. The image data would need to exceed the buffer size of the `ImageStream` object, causing a buffer overflow and leading to the execution of arbitrary code","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the FT_Load_Glyph function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input glyph index is too large. The function takes an FT_UInt as input, which is an unsigned integer type. However, the function does not perform any bounds checking on the input value, which means that an attacker can potentially overflow the buffer by providing a large value for the glyph index.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a crafted PDF file that contains a large glyph index value. The attacker could then use this value to overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should perform bounds checking on the input value to ensure that it is within the valid range. Additionally, the code should use a safer function such as FT_Get_Glyph_Index to retrieve the glyph index, which performs bounds checking and returns 0 if the glyph index is invalid.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code allows a symlink to point outside of a share, which can bypass intended file-access restrictions. This can be exploited by creating a symlink that points to a file outside of the share, and then accessing the symlink. The code does not properly check the validity of the symlink, which allows an attacker to access files outside of the share.

177856,,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `do_ed_script` takes in a file name as input and uses the `editor_program` variable to execute a shell command. The `editor_program` variable is set to the string ""ed"" which is a text editor program. The `editor_program` variable is then used in the `sprintf` function to create a shell command that is executed by the `execl` function. The `sprintf` function takes in a format string and a variable number of arguments, and returns a string that is the result of formatting the format string with the arguments. The format string in this case is ""%s %s%s"", which is a string that contains the editor program name followed by a space and then the output file name. The output file name is obtained from the `outname` variable, which is a pointer to a character array. The `outname` variable is set to the value of the `outname` parameter passed to the `do_ed_script` function.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `outname` variable is not properly validated before it is used in the `sprintf` function. An attacker could potentially pass a malicious value to the `outname` parameter, which could be a shell command that is executed by the `execl` function.

177906,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input value is too large.

If the input value is too large, the function will return a value that is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input value, but rather a value that is too large to fit in the integer type. This can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

For example, if the input value is 2^31 (a very large number), the function will return 2^31 - 1, which is a valid integer, but it is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input value. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other security vulnerability.

To fix the vulnerability, the `splashFloor` function should be modified to check for overflows and return an error value if an overflow occurs. This can be done by using the","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `sumRemoteness` function, which takes a vector of vectors of integers as input and returns a long long integer. The function uses a BFS algorithm to traverse the grid and calculate the sum of the elements in each group. However, the function does not properly check the size of the input vector before accessing its elements, which can lead to an overflow if the input vector is too large.

Additionally, the function uses a static variable `DIRECTIONS` to store the directions to traverse the grid. However, the variable is not properly initialized, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

Therefore, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability, which can be exploited by providing a specially crafted input vector to the `sumRemoteness` function.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
