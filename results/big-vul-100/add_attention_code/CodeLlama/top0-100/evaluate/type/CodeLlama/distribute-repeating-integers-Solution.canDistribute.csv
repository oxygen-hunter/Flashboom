177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
if (requirement[submask] <= cnts[i] && dp[i % 2][mask ^ submask]) {
    dp[(i + 1) % 2][mask] = 1;
}
```
Here, the function checks if the requirement for a particular submask is met, and if so, sets the corresponding bit in the result vector. However, the check is not properly implemented, and the function does not take into account the possibility that the requirement may be met due to the presence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC.

Therefore, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, and then using the function","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `getLine` function in the `ImageStream` class, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input stream contains more data than the buffer can hold. The `getLine` function does not perform any bounds checking on the input data, and instead relies on the caller to ensure that the input data is valid.

If the `width` or `height` parameter is not properly validated, an attacker can potentially cause a buffer overflow by providing a large value for these parameters. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, potentially allowing the attacker to take control of the system or steal sensitive data.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to craft a specially crafted PDF file that contains a malicious image with a large `width` and `height` parameter. The attacker could then use this image to trigger the vulnerability and execute arbitrary code on the system.

It is important to note that this vulnerability is not limited to the `drawImage` function, but can be found in other functions that use similar techniques to allocate memory for image data. Therefore, it is important to thoroughly review the codebase and ensure that all such functions are properly validated and sanitized to prevent potential vulnerabilities.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `drawMaskedImage` function, which takes a `Stream` object as input and processes it in a way that can lead to a buffer overflow. The function uses the `ImageStream` class to read the input stream, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input stream is too large. Additionally, the function uses the `SplashBitmap` class to create a bitmap from the input stream, which can also lead to a buffer overflow if the input stream is too large.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a malicious PDF file that contains a large image mask, which can cause the `drawMaskedImage` function to overflow its buffers and execute arbitrary code. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, as well as the potential for other types of vulnerabilities, such as integer overflows or use-after-free errors.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should be updated to properly validate and sanitize user input, especially in functions like `gets`, `scanf`, or file and network input handling. Additionally, the","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer of a fixed size, and if the image data exceeds this buffer, it can cause a buffer overflow. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, including code that can cause a denial of service or other types of vulnerabilities.

The vulnerability is caused by the `imgMaskData.imgStr = new ImageStream(maskStr, maskWidth, maskColorMap->getNumPixelComps(), maskColorMap->getBits());` line, which creates a new `ImageStream` object with a buffer size that is dependent on the image data. If the image data exceeds this buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a crafted PDF file with a large image that exceeds the buffer size of the `ImageStream` class. This can be done by sending a malicious PDF file that contains a large image with a high number of pixels, or by using a specially crafted PDF file that","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `atof` function to convert a string to a floating-point number. If the input string is not a valid floating-point number, the `atof` function returns a NaN (Not a Number) value. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the program, including crashes or incorrect results.

In this case, the `atof` function is used to convert the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute to a floating-point number. If the attribute is not a valid floating-point number, the `atof` function returns a NaN value, which is then assigned to the `m_refreshDelayFactor` variable. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the program, including crashes or incorrect results.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly validate the input string before converting it to a floating-point number. This can be done by using a function like `strtod` or `strtof` to convert the string to a floating-point number, and checking the return value to ensure that the conversion was successful.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `dp` array, which is used to store the results of the dynamic programming algorithm. The `dp` array is initialized with the values of the previous row, and the values are updated using the following formula:
```
dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]

The `editor_program` variable is set to the string ""ed"" which is a command-line editor. The `editor_program` variable is then used in a `sprintf` function to create a shell command that is executed by the `execl` function. The `execl` function takes in a string as the first argument, which is the command to be executed. The second argument is the path to the executable file. The third argument is the name of the file to be executed. The fourth argument is the environment in which the command is executed. The fifth argument is the argument to be passed to the command.

The vulnerability is caused by the `sprintf` function, which takes in a format string as the first argument and a variable number of arguments as the second argument. The format string is then used to create a new string that is passed to the `execl` function.

177906,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashDist` function, which calculates the distance between two points. The function takes two `SplashCoord` arguments, `x0` and `y0`, and returns the distance between them. However, the function does not properly validate the input values, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input values are too large.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input to the `splashDist` function, which causes the function to write to memory outside the bounds of the allocated buffer. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control of the system or steal sensitive data.

To fix the vulnerability, the `splashDist` function should properly validate the input values and ensure that they are within the bounds of the allocated buffer. Additionally, the function should return a specific error code if the input values are invalid, which can help prevent the exploitation of the vulnerability.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code contains a vulnerability. The vulnerability is a buffer overflow vulnerability, specifically a stack buffer overflow. The vulnerability occurs in the `canDistribute` function, where the `nums` vector is passed as a parameter to the `canDistribute` function. The `canDistribute` function then uses the `nums` vector to calculate the number of possible combinations of the `quantity` vector. The `canDistribute` function does not perform any bounds checking on the `nums` vector, which means that it can potentially overflow the stack buffer if the `nums` vector is too large.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a specially crafted `nums` vector that is larger than the maximum allowed size. The attacker could then use a buffer overflow attack to overwrite the return address on the stack with the address of a malicious function, which would be executed when the `canDistribute` function returns. This could potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process.

To fix this vulnerability, the `canDistribute` function should perform bounds checking on the `nums` vector to ensure that it is not too large. Alternatively, the `canDistribute` function could be modified to use a different approach to calculate the number of possible combinations of the `quantity` vector, such as using a dynamic programming approach.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
