177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are required to set the UF_DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWD, UF_ENCRYPTED_TEXT_PASSWORD_ALLOWED, UF_SERVER_TRUST_ACCOUNT, UF_PARTIAL_SECRETS_ACCOUNT, and UF_INTERDOMAIN_TRUST_ACCOUNT bits in the userAccountControl attribute.

The function does not properly check for the presence of these rights, which allows an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions and create machine accounts with the required rights.

177786,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `colToByte` function, which takes a `GfxGray` or `GfxRGB` value and converts it to a `Guchar` value. The function has a potential integer overflow vulnerability, as the value of `gray` or `rgb` can be greater than 255, leading to an overflow and a potential buffer overflow.

Additionally, the `imgData.lookup` array is allocated with a size of `n` and is used to store the color values for the image. However, the `n` value is not properly validated, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the value of `n` is too large.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large value of `n` and a large value of `gray` or `rgb`, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially arbitrary code execution.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the code. The function takes in two integer parameters, `width` and `height`, and uses them to calculate the size of the `maskBitmap` and `maskSplash` objects. If the values of `width` and `height` are large enough, the calculation can result in integer overflows, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an executable code overflow.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large value for `width` and `height`, causing the `maskBitmap` and `maskSplash` objects to be allocated with a large size. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, as the application may crash or become unresponsive due to the large memory usage.

Additionally, the code also uses the `maskInvert` parameter to invert the mask, which can also lead to an executable code overflow if the value of `maskInvert` is not properly validated.

Therefore, it is recommended to fix the vulnerability by properly validating the `maskInvert` parameter and","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `colToByte` function, which takes a `GfxGray` value and returns a `Guchar` value. The `GfxGray` value is a 16-bit integer, and the `Guchar` value is an 8-bit integer. The `colToByte` function does not perform any bounds checking on the `GfxGray` value, which allows an attacker to overflow the `GfxGray` value and cause a buffer overflow.

The buffer overflow can be exploited to execute arbitrary code, leading to a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability. The exploit can be carried out by sending a crafted PDF file with a malicious image that has a large number of pixels, causing the buffer to overflow and execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is fixed in Poppler 0.10.6 and later versions.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gmalloc` function, which allocates memory using the `malloc` function. If the `malloc` function fails to allocate memory, it returns a null pointer, which is then used to access memory outside the allocated region. This can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted PDF file that contains a large number of objects, each with a large number of bytes. The `gmalloc` function is used to allocate memory for each object, and if the `malloc` function fails to allocate memory, the application crashes.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to send a specially crafted PDF file to the application, which can cause the application to allocate a large amount of memory and crash. This can be done by sending a large number of objects with a large number of bytes each, which can cause the application to allocate a large amount of memory and crash.

The fix for this vulnerability is to use a memory allocation function that checks for memory allocation failures and returns a null pointer instead of crashing the application.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_Load_Glyph` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input glyph index is too large. The function takes an `FT_UInt` parameter, which is an unsigned integer type, and the input glyph index is converted to an `FT_UInt` value. However, if the input glyph index is too large, it can cause an integer overflow, leading to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large glyph index, which can cause the `FT_Load_Glyph` function to overflow the buffer and crash the application. This can be done by sending a malicious PDF file with a large glyph index, which can cause the `FT_Load_Glyph` function to overflow the buffer and crash the application.

It appears to be a function that takes a string and converts it to a codepoint using the smb_iconv_handle structure. The function checks the length of the string and then uses the get_conv_handle function to get a descriptor for the conversion. It then uses the smb_iconv function to convert the string to a codepoint. The function also checks the length of the converted string and returns the codepoint.

There are no obvious security vulnerabilities in the code. However, it is important to note that the code is using the smb_iconv function, which is a low-level conversion function that can be used to convert between different character encodings. It is possible that the code is vulnerable to security vulnerabilities related to the use of this function, such as buffer overflows or use-after-free errors.

The `Splash::blitMask` function takes a `SplashBitmap` object as input and performs a series of operations on it. The function uses a `SplashPipe` object to perform the operations, which can be used to manipulate the pixels of the `SplashBitmap` object.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `SplashPipe` object, which can be used to manipulate the pixels of the `SplashBitmap` object. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted `SplashBitmap` object that contains a large number of pixels, which can cause the `SplashPipe` object to run out of memory.

Both functions are used to manipulate the input data and ensure that it is within the expected range. However, if the input data is not properly validated, it can cause a buffer overflow.

For example, if the input data is a large floating-point number, it can cause a buffer overflow when it is converted to an integer. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, as the application may crash or become unresponsive.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashDist` function, which calculates the distance between two points. The function takes two `SplashCoord` arguments, `x0` and `y0`, and returns the distance between them. However, the function does not properly validate the input values, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input values are too large.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input to the `splashDist` function, which causes the function to write to memory outside the allocated buffer. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control of the system.
