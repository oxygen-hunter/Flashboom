177736,Bypass,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are necessary to create machine accounts. This allows an attacker to create machine accounts with the desired privileges, bypassing the intended access restrictions.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC. The attacker can then use this vulnerability to bypass intended access restrictions and create machine accounts with the desired privileges. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or system resources.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

The code is using the `estrdup` function to allocate memory for the `strbuf` variable, which is a buffer that is used to store the time string. The `estrdup` function is a wrapper around the `malloc` function, which allocates memory from the heap. The memory allocated by `estrdup` is not freed until the `strbuf` variable goes out of scope, which is when the function returns. Therefore, there is no memory leak in this code.

Furthermore, the code is not using any deprecated or insecure functions, such as `gets`, `scanf`, or `strcpy`. It is using the `snprintf` function to format the time string, which is a safer alternative to `sprintf`.

The code is also not using any improper error handling mechanisms, such as ignoring or mishandling exceptions or errors. It is using the `php_error_docref` function to log errors, which is a safer alternative to `printf`.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `fz_try` macro, which catches all exceptions and ignores them. This allows an attacker to intentionally cause an exception to be thrown, which would otherwise be caught and handled by the `fz_catch` block. However, since the `fz_try` block catches all exceptions, the exception is not propagated to the `fz_catch` block, and the program continues to execute without any error handling.

This allows an attacker to potentially cause a denial of service (DoS) by intentionally causing an exception to be thrown, which would otherwise be caught and handled by the `fz_catch` block. The attacker can potentially cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code, depending on the specific exception that is thrown.

To fix this vulnerability, the `fz_try` macro should be modified to only catch specific exceptions that are expected to be thrown, and not catch all exceptions.

177787,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `drawMaskedImage` function, which takes a `Stream` object as an argument and processes it in a way that can lead to a buffer overflow. The function uses the `ImageStream` class to read the image data from the stream, and then processes the data using the `Splash` class. However, the `Splash` class does not properly check the size of the image data, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the image data is too large.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file that contains a large image with a malicious payload. The payload can be designed to overflow the buffer used to store the image data, leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

To fix the vulnerability, the `Splash` class should be modified to properly check the size of the image data and prevent buffer overflows. Additionally, the `ImageStream` class should be modified to properly handle large image data and prevent buffer overflows.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177788,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the ImageStream class, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input stream contains a crafted PDF file. The code does not properly check the size of the input stream, which can lead to a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
imgData.imgStr = new ImageStream(str, width,
                                colorMap->getNumPixelComps(),
                                colorMap->getBits());
```
The ImageStream class does not properly check the size of the input stream, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input stream contains a crafted PDF file. This can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly check the size of the input stream before creating the ImageStream object. This can be done by using the ImageStream::getSize() method to get the size of the input stream and then checking if the size is greater than the maximum allowed size. If the size is greater than the maximum allowed size, the code should throw an exception or return an error.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ceil` function to calculate the width and height of the output surface. If the input values are large enough, the `ceil` function can overflow, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to provide a crafted PDF file with a large value for the `scale` parameter. The `scale` parameter is used to calculate the width and height of the output surface, and if the value is too large, it can overflow.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should use a safer function to calculate the width and height of the output surface, such as `round` or `trunc`. Additionally, the code should check for overflows and handle them appropriately.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_Load_Glyph` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input glyph index is too large. The function takes an `FT_UInt` parameter, which is an unsigned integer, but the code does not perform any bounds checking on the input value. This means that if the input value is greater than the maximum value that can be represented by the `FT_UInt` type, the function will write beyond the end of the allocated memory buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large glyph index value, which can cause the `FT_Load_Glyph` function to write beyond the end of the allocated memory buffer. This can lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution, depending on the context in which the code is running.

To fix the vulnerability, the code should perform bounds checking on the input glyph index value to ensure that it is within the valid range.

177799,Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to an integer overflow vulnerability. The function takes in a vector of vectors of integers as input, and then performs a series of operations on the data. However, the code does not perform any bounds checking on the input data, which means that it is possible for the input data to cause an integer overflow. Specifically, the function uses the `vector<vector<int>>` data structure, which can cause an integer overflow if the input data is too large.

The vulnerability is caused by the line `dist[nr][nc] = dist[r][c] + 1;`, which adds 1 to the value of `dist[r][c]`. If the value of `dist[r][c]` is close to the maximum value of an integer, then adding 1 to it can cause an integer overflow. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the function returning incorrect results or crashing.

To fix the vulnerability, the code should perform bounds checking on the input data to ensure that it is within the valid range. This can be done by using the `std::vector` class's `at()` method, which throws an exception if the index is out of bounds. Alternatively, the code can use the `std::vector` class's `operator[]` method, which returns a reference to the element at the specified index, but does not perform bounds checking.

The code is using the `talloc_strdup` function to make a copy of the `share` parameter, which is a string. The `talloc_strdup` function is a memory allocation function that allocates memory for a string and copies the contents of the string into the new memory block. It does not modify the original string. Therefore, there is no vulnerability related to buffer overflow or use after free.

The code is also using the `strchr_m` function to find the position of the first occurrence of the character '\\' in the `sharename` string. If the character is not found, the function returns a null pointer. The code then checks if the pointer is null and returns an error if it is. Therefore, there is no vulnerability related to null pointer dereference.

The code is also using the `strncpy` function to copy the contents of the `sharename` string into the `servicename` string. The `strncpy` function is a memory copy function that copies the contents of the source string into the destination string, up to the specified number of characters. It does not modify the original string. Therefore, there is no vulnerability related to buffer overflow or use after free.

177855,Bypass,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-5252. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code allows a symlink to point outside of a share, which can bypass intended file-access restrictions. This can be exploited by creating a symlink that points to a file outside of the share, and then accessing the symlink. The code does not properly check the validity of the symlink, which allows an attacker to access files outside of the share.

This vulnerability is similar to the one described in CVE-2015-5252, which affects Samba 3.x and 4.x before 4.1.22, 4.2.x before 4.2.7, and 4.3.x before 4.3.3.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

",3.0,810.0,6.0,3.172238826751709
177856,,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `do_ed_script` takes in a `char const *inname` and a `char const *outname` as input, and then uses the `strcpy` function to copy the contents of `inname` into a buffer. However, the buffer is not properly sized, and the `strcpy` function can potentially overflow the buffer, leading to a security vulnerability.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `strcpy` function does not perform any bounds checking on the input string, and it simply copies the contents of the input string into the buffer without any validation. This means that if the input string is longer than the buffer, the `strcpy` function will write beyond the end of the buffer, potentially overwriting other parts of the program's memory.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could provide a specially crafted input string that is longer than the buffer, causing the `strcpy` function to write beyond the end of the buffer. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, as the attacker could potentially write malicious code into the program's memory.

177906,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the input. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input value is too large.

If the input value is too large, the function will return a value that is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input, but rather a value that is too large to fit in the integer type. This can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code, depending on the specific implementation of the function.

In this case, the vulnerability can be exploited by providing a large floating-point number as input to the `splashFloor` function, which will cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, as the program will be unable to process any user input or perform any meaningful operations.

To fix the vulnerability, the `splashFloor` function should be modified to check","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177912,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro, which is used to read a 32-bit unsigned integer from a buffer. However, the macro does not perform any bounds checking, which means that it can read beyond the end of the buffer, potentially leading to an overflow.

In the given code, the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro is used to read the `length` variable, which is used to determine the size of the buffer. However, the `length` variable is not properly validated, which means that it can be set to a value that is larger than the actual size of the buffer. This can lead to an overflow, as the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro will read beyond the end of the buffer, potentially overwriting other variables or code.

Therefore, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code contains a potential Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `max` function in the `maxMoves` function, which takes two integer arguments and returns the larger of the two. If the two arguments are very large, the result of the `max` function can overflow, leading to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to provide two large integer arguments to the `maxMoves` function, which can be done by crafting a specially-crafted input to the function. If the attacker can successfully exploit this vulnerability, they can execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the affected system.

Therefore, it is important to fix this vulnerability by using a safer function, such as `std::max`, which can handle large integer arguments without overflowing.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177919,,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `XListFonts` takes a pattern as an input, which can be a malicious string that is longer than the maximum allowed length. If the pattern is longer than the maximum allowed length, it can cause a buffer overflow, leading to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strlen` function to determine the length of the pattern string. However, `strlen` does not check for buffer overflows, and it can return incorrect results if the string is not null-terminated. In this case, the `XListFonts` function will continue to read from the pattern string until it reaches the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, the `XListFonts` function should use a safer function to determine the length of the pattern string, such as `strnlen` or `strlen_s`. Additionally, the function should check for buffer overflows and return an error if the pattern string is too long.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.
