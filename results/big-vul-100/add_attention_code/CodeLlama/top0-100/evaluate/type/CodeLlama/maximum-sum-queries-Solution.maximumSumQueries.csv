177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The function uses a map to check for specific user account control (UAC) bits and their corresponding GUIDs. However, it does not properly check for administrative privileges, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC. The attacker can then use the function to create a machine account with the desired UAC bits, which can bypass intended access restrictions.

The vulnerability can be mitigated by properly checking for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This can be done by adding additional checks to ensure that the user has the necessary privileges to perform the operation.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

177740,DoS Exec Code Overflow Mem. Corr.,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to any of the security vulnerabilities you mentioned.

The code is using the `estrdup` function to allocate memory for the `strbuf` variable, which is a buffer that is used to store the time string. The `estrdup` function is a wrapper around the `malloc` function, which allocates memory from the heap. The memory allocated by `estrdup` is not freed until the `strbuf` variable goes out of scope, which is when the function returns.

Therefore, the memory allocated by `estrdup` is not vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack, as the attacker cannot write more data to the buffer than the allocated size.

Furthermore, the code is using the `mktime` function to convert the time string to a `time_t` value, which is a 32-bit integer. The `mktime` function takes a `struct tm` value as input, which contains the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second. The `struct tm` value is initialized with the values from the time string, and the `mktime` function returns the number of seconds since the Epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC).

The `mktime` function does not have any buffer overflow vulnerabilities","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow_Mem._Corr. vulnerability.

The code is a function that takes in a session object and returns a pointer to a buffer that contains the serialized session data. The function checks if the session is resumable and if it is, it packs the session data into a buffer. The function then returns the buffer and its size.

The vulnerability you mentioned is related to the use of the `strcpy` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the destination buffer is not large enough to hold the source string. However, the code does not use the `strcpy` function, it uses the `_gnutls_session_pack` function which is a custom function that is used to pack the session data.

177787,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer size of 4096 bytes, which can be overflowed by a crafted PDF file. If the image data exceeds this buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the `drawMaskedImage` function, which takes a `Stream` object as input and uses it to read image data. The `drawMaskedImage` function does not perform any bounds checking on the input stream, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the image data exceeds the buffer size.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a PDF file with a large image data stream, which can overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, as the application may crash or behave unexpectedly.

To fix this vulnerability, the `ImageStream` class should be modified to perform bounds checking on the input stream, or the `drawMaskedImage","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177788,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer size of 4096 bytes, which can be overflowed by a crafted PDF file. If the image data exceeds this buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the `imgData.imgStr->reset()` function, which resets the `ImageStream` object to its initial state. However, this function does not check if the buffer size has been exceeded, and it does not reset the buffer size to its initial value. This means that if the image data exceeds the buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to craft a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large image with a large number of pixels. The image data can be read from the PDF file using the `ImageStream` class, and if the buffer size is not properly checked, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_Load_Glyph` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input glyph index is too large. The function takes an `FT_UInt` parameter, which is an unsigned integer type, and the input glyph index is converted to this type before being passed to the function. However, if the input glyph index is too large, it will be converted to a value that is greater than the maximum value that can be represented by the `FT_UInt` type, causing an overflow.

The code is a C++ function that parses an XML file using the libxml2 library. It does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, or memory leaks.

However, it is important to note that the code is using the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` function, which can be vulnerable to XXE attacks if the XML file being parsed contains an XML external entity declaration. This is because the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` function does not perform any validation on the XML file, and it can be exploited by an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should use the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxtWithData` function instead, which takes an additional `data` parameter that can be used to specify a custom entity loader. This can be used to load the XML file using a custom entity loader that performs validation on the XML file before parsing it.

Additionally, the code should also use the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` function with the `options` parameter set to `XML_PARSE_NOENT` to prevent the parser from expanding external entities.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input value is too large.

If the input value is too large, the function will return a value that is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input value, but rather a value that is too large to be stored in an integer variable. This can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

For example, if the input value is 2^31 (which is the largest integer that can be stored in a 32-bit signed integer), the function will return 2^31 - 1, which is a valid integer. However, if the input value is 2^31 + 1, the function will return 2^31, which is not a valid integer and can cause a crash or other security vulnerability.

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` and `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macros, which are used to read and write data to the stream. These macros use the `FT_READ_BYTE` and `FT_READ_USHORT` functions, which can cause an integer overflow if the number of bytes or words to be read exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the type.

For example, if the `num_glyphs` variable is set to a large value, the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` macro will attempt to read `num_glyphs - 1` * 2 bytes from the stream, which can cause an integer overflow if `num_glyphs` is greater than the maximum value that can be represented by a `FT_UInt`. Similarly, the `FT_READ_USHORT` function can also cause an integer overflow if the number of words to be read exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by a `FT_UShort`.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that the values of `num_","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
