The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are required to set the UF_DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWD, UF_ENCRYPTED_TEXT_PASSWORD_ALLOWED, UF_SERVER_TRUST_ACCOUNT, UF_PARTIAL_SECRETS_ACCOUNT, and UF_INTERDOMAIN_TRUST_ACCOUNT bits in the userAccountControl attribute.

The function does not properly check for the presence of these rights, which allows an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions and create machine accounts with the required rights. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or system compromise.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

The code is using the `estrdup` function to allocate memory for the `strbuf` variable, which is a buffer that is used to store the time string. The `estrdup` function is a wrapper around the `malloc` function, which allocates memory from the heap. The memory allocated by `estrdup` is not freed until the `efree` function is called, which is not shown in the code snippet. Therefore, there is no memory leak in the code.

The code also uses the `memset` function to initialize the `thetime` structure, which sets all the members of the structure to zero. This ensures that the structure is properly initialized and that any uninitialized members are set to a known value.

The code also uses the `atoi` function to convert the string representation of the time to an integer. This function is a safe function that checks the input string for validity and returns 0 if the input string is not a valid integer. Therefore, there is no buffer overflow vulnerability in the code.

Finally, the code uses the `mktime` function to convert the `thetime` structure to a time_t value. This function is a safe function that checks the input structure for validity and returns a time_t value if the input structure is valid.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow_Mem._Corr. vulnerability.

The code is using the `gnutls_session_get_data` function to retrieve the data of a TLS session. The function takes a `session_data` parameter, which is a pointer to a buffer where the data will be stored. The function also takes a `session_data_size` parameter, which is a pointer to a variable that will be set to the size of the data that was stored in the buffer.

The code is checking if the size of the data that was stored in the buffer is greater than the size of the buffer, and if so, it returns an error code. This is a valid check, as it prevents the function from writing more data to the buffer than it has allocated space for.

However, the code is not checking if the data that was stored in the buffer is larger than the size of the buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow. A buffer overflow occurs when more data is written to a buffer than it has allocated space for, causing the extra data to overwrite other parts of the buffer or other memory locations.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gets` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input string is too long. The `gets` function does not perform any bounds checking, and it does not provide any mechanism for the user to specify the maximum length of the input string. This means that an attacker can potentially input a string that is longer than the buffer, causing a buffer overflow and potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted PDF file to the application, which would cause the `gets` function to read beyond the end of the buffer and overwrite the return address on the stack. The attacker could then control the return address to point to a malicious function, which would be executed when the `gets` function returns. This could potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of data from the stream and returns it as a string. However, the method does not perform any bounds checking on the length of the string, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the string is too long.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PDF file that contains a large image with a malicious string. The string can be made large enough to overflow the buffer and overwrite the return address on the stack, leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is related to the following functions:

* `ImageStream::getLine`
* `SplashOutputDev::drawImage`
* `Splash::drawImage`

The vulnerability is not present in the latest version of Poppler, which is 0.41.0.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177787,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses a naive approach to handle integer overflows, which can lead to a buffer overflow attack. Specifically, the code uses the `strcpy` function to copy a string into a buffer, which can overflow the buffer if the string is too long. This can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a specially crafted PDF file that contains a long string in the `maskStr` parameter of the `drawMaskedImage` function. The string can be crafted to overflow the buffer and cause a buffer overflow attack.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should use a safer approach to handle integer overflows, such as using the `strncpy` function with a maximum length parameter. Additionally, the code should check for buffer overflows using a bounds-checking mechanism, such as using the `strlen` function to determine the length of the string before copying it into the buffer.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer size of 4096 bytes, which can be overflowed by a crafted PDF file. If the image data exceeds this buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the `imgMaskData.imgStr->reset()` function, which resets the `ImageStream` object to its initial state. However, this function does not check if the buffer size has been exceeded, and it does not reset the buffer size to its initial value. This means that if the image data exceeds the buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to craft a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large image with a large number of pixels. The image data can be crafted to exceed the buffer size of the `ImageStream` object, causing a buffer overflow and potentially executing arbitrary code.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gmalloc` function, which allocates memory for the `data` and `alpha` arrays. The `gmalloc` function uses a static buffer to store the allocated memory, and if the memory allocation exceeds the size of the static buffer, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, as the application may crash or become unresponsive due to the buffer overflow.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `gmalloc` function should be modified to use dynamic memory allocation, or the static buffer should be increased in size.

177850,DoS Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-5289. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function `differByOne` takes a vector of strings as input, and then iterates over each string in the vector, computing a hash value for each string. The hash values are then used to compare the strings and determine if they differ by one character.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the hash values are computed using a modulo operation, which can result in collisions. Specifically, if two strings have the same hash value, but differ by one character, the function will incorrectly report that they are the same. This can lead to a denial-of-service attack, as the function will continue to iterate over the strings, potentially causing a stack overflow.

To fix the vulnerability, the function should use a more robust hash function, such as a cryptographic hash function, to compute the hash values. Alternatively, the function could use a different approach to compare the strings, such as using a sliding window or a suffix tree.","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `imgCoordMungeLowerC` and `imgCoordMungeUpperC` functions do not perform any bounds checking on the input string. They simply iterate over the characters in the string and perform some calculations. However, if the input string is too long, it can cause a buffer overflow, which can lead to a crash or a denial of service.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can provide a long input string that contains a lot of characters. The `imgCoordMungeLowerC` and `imgCoordMungeUpperC` functions will iterate over the characters in the string and perform some calculations, but they will not check if the input string is too long.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashDist` function, which calculates the distance between two points. The function uses the `sqrt` function to calculate the distance, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the distance is too large. The buffer overflow can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input to the `makeDashedPath` function, which can cause the `splashDist` function to overflow the buffer. The overflow can be triggered by sending a large distance between two points, which can cause the `sqrt` function to overflow the buffer.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted input to the `makeDashedPath` function, which can cause the `splashDist` function to overflow the buffer. The attacker can then use the overflow to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `differByOne` function, which takes a vector of strings as input and returns `true` if any two strings in the vector differ by only one character. The function uses a hash table to store the hash values of the strings, and then iterates through the hash values to find any two strings that differ by only one character.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `unordered_map` data structure, which is not bounds-checked. If the input vector contains a large number of strings, the hash table may overflow, leading to an integer overflow and a buffer overflow. This can result in arbitrary code execution, including the execution of malicious code.

To fix the vulnerability, the `unordered_map` data structure should be replaced with a bounds-checked data structure, such as a `std::map`. Additionally, the input vector should be validated to ensure that it does not contain too many strings.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
