177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are necessary to create machine accounts. This allows an attacker to create a machine account with the desired UAC bits set, even if they do not have the necessary rights.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC. The attacker can then create a machine account with the desired UAC bits set, which will bypass intended access restrictions.

The recommended fix is to properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This can be done by checking for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

177786,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the number of bytes read. This means that if the image data is corrupted or malicious, it can cause the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the stream, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious PDF file that contains a specially crafted image with a large number of pixels. The image data can be made to overflow the buffer allocated for the image, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially arbitrary code execution.

To fix the vulnerability, the `ImageStream` class should be modified to perform bounds checking on the number of bytes read from the stream. This can be done by checking the number of bytes read against the total size of the image data, and returning an error if the number of bytes read exceeds the total size of the image data. This will prevent the `Image","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input stream contains a malicious PDF file. The `ImageStream` class uses a fixed-size buffer to read data from the input stream, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input stream contains more data than the buffer can hold. This can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the `drawMaskedImage` function, which uses the `ImageStream` class to read data from the input stream. The function does not properly check the size of the input stream, which can lead to a buffer overflow. Additionally, the function does not properly validate the input data, which can lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a malicious PDF file that contains a large amount of data in the image stream. The attacker can then send the malicious PDF file to the application, which will cause the buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is fixed in Poppler 0.10.6 and later versions.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer size of 4096 bytes, which can be overflowed by a crafted PDF file. If the image data exceeds this buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the `imgMaskData.imgStr->reset()` function, which resets the `ImageStream` object to its initial state. However, this function does not check if the buffer size has been exceeded, and it does not reset the buffer size to its initial value. This means that if the image data exceeds the buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to craft a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large image with a large number of pixels. The image data can be crafted to exceed the buffer size of the `ImageStream` object, causing a buffer overflow and potentially executing arbitrary code.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input number is too large.

If the input number is too large, the function will return a value that is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input number, but rather a value that is too large to fit in the integer type. This can cause the `lineDashStartIdx` variable to take on a value that is not within the bounds of the `state->lineDash` array, leading to a buffer overflow.

The buffer overflow can cause the program to write to memory locations that it is not authorized to access, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute malicious code with elevated privileges, leading to a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability.
