The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large number of pixels, which can cause the program to allocate a large amount of memory and crash. This can lead to a denial of service attack, where the attacker can make the program crash and become unavailable to users.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the program should use a memory allocation function that checks for memory allocation failures and handle them gracefully. Additionally, the `getRGBLine` function should be modified to check for buffer overflows and handle them appropriately.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `min` function in the `z_function` function, which can cause an integer overflow if the input values are large enough. Specifically, the `min` function is used to compute the minimum of two integers, and if the two integers are equal, the function returns the first integer. However, if the first integer is equal to the maximum value of the integer type, and the second integer is equal to the minimum value of the integer type, the function will return the second integer, which can cause an integer overflow.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a malicious PDF file that contains a large number of characters in the `word` string, and then use the `min` function in the `z_function` function to compute the minimum of two large integers. If the two integers are equal, the function will return the second integer, which can cause an integer overflow and lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, the `min` function should be replaced with a more robust function that can handle large input values without causing an integer overflow","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177850,DoS Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-5289. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function `datum_to_json` does not properly handle the case where the input string is longer than the buffer allocated for it. The function uses the `strcpy` function to copy the input string into the buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is too long.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted input string that is longer than the buffer allocated for it. The buffer overflow will cause the function to write data to memory outside of the allocated buffer, potentially leading to a crash or other security issue.

To fix this vulnerability, the function should use a safer method for copying the input string, such as `strncpy` or `memcpy`, and ensure that the input string is properly validated to ensure that it is not too long.","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

177852,DoS Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-5289. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `lex_expect` function, which expects a specific token to be present in the input. However, if the token is not present, the function will continue to consume input until it finds the expected token or reaches the end of the input. This can lead to a stack buffer overflow if the input is malicious and contains a large number of tokens that are not expected.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malicious input that contains a large number of tokens that are not expected, causing the `lex_expect` function to consume a large amount of memory and eventually leading to a stack buffer overflow. This can cause the server to crash or become unresponsive, leading to a denial of service (DoS) attack.

The vulnerability can be mitigated by properly handling the input and ensuring that the `lex_expect` function does not consume too much memory. This can be done by implementing a maximum input size limit, or by using a more secure input handling mechanism such as a bounded buffer.","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `setPath` function does not properly handle the `WJB_BEGIN_ARRAY` and `WJB_BEGIN_OBJECT` cases, which can lead to a stack-based buffer overflow. The function calls `pushJsonbValue` with the `r` parameter set to `WJB_BEGIN_ARRAY` or `WJB_BEGIN_OBJECT`, which pushes a new value onto the stack. However, the function does not check the size of the stack before pushing the new value, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the stack is already full.

Furthermore, the function does not properly handle the `WJB_ELEM` and `WJB_VALUE` cases, which can also lead to a buffer overflow. The function calls `pushJsonbValue` with the `r` parameter set to `WJB_ELEM` or `WJB_VALUE`, which pushes a new value onto the stack.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `min` function in the `minimumTimeToInitialState` function, which can cause an integer overflow if the input `k` is large enough. Specifically, the `min` function is used to compute the minimum value of `r - i + 1` and `z[i - l]`. If `r - i + 1` is equal to `INT_MAX`, then `z[i - l]` will be equal to `INT_MAX` as well, causing an integer overflow when computing `min(r - i + 1, z[i - l])`. This can lead to an out-of-bounds write, which can potentially execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the `min` function should be replaced with a safer function that can handle large values, such as the `std::min` function from the C++ standard library.

However, the length of the list is not validated, and the function does not check if the length of the list exceeds the maximum allowed length.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of extensions to the server, causing the `rep.nExtensions` field to overflow and overwrite the return address on the stack.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function `minimumTimeToInitialState` uses the `z_function` function, which is vulnerable to off-by-one errors. The `z_function` function calculates the z-function of a string, which is a function that tells the minimum number of characters that need to be shifted to the right to make the string a prefix of itself. The function is vulnerable to off-by-one errors because it assumes that the z-function is always non-zero, which is not always the case.

For example, if the input string is ""abc"", then the z-function would be [0, 1, 2]. However, if the input string is ""abca"", then the z-function would be [0, 1, 2, 3], which is not correct. The function would return 3 instead of 4, which is the correct answer.

177927,,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The function takes a string as input and uses the strcpy function to copy the string into a buffer. The buffer is allocated on the stack, and the size of the buffer is not checked. This means that if the input string is longer than the size of the buffer, it will overflow the buffer and cause a buffer overflow vulnerability.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.
