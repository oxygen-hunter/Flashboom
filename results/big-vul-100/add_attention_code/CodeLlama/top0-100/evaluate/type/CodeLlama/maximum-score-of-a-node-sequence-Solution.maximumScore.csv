177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are required to create machine accounts. This allows an attacker to create a machine account with the desired UAC bits set, even if they do not have the necessary rights.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC. The attacker can then create a machine account with the desired UAC bits set, which will bypass intended access restrictions.

The recommended fix is to properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This can be done by checking for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the line length. This means that if the line length exceeds the maximum allowed length, the `getLine` method will read beyond the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

The `drawImage` method in the code uses the `ImageStream` class to read image data from a stream, and it does not perform any bounds checking on the image data. This means that if the image data exceeds the maximum allowed length, the `drawImage` method will read beyond the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

This vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large image that exceeds the maximum allowed length, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially arbitrary code execution.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the code. The function takes in two integer parameters, `width` and `height`, which are used to calculate the size of the `SplashBitmap` object. If the values of `width` and `height` are large enough, the calculation can result in an integer overflow, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an executable code overflow.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large value for `width` and `height`, causing the `SplashBitmap` object to be allocated with a large size. This can lead to a denial of service (application crash) or potentially an executable code overflow.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the values of `width` and `height` are validated and sanitized before being used in the calculation. Additionally, the code should ensure that the `SplashBitmap` object is allocated with a reasonable size, taking into account the maximum allowed size of the image.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177788,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer size of 4096 bytes, which can be overflowed by a crafted PDF file. If the image data exceeds this buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the `imgMaskData.imgStr->reset()` function, which resets the `ImageStream` object to its initial state. However, this function does not check if the buffer size has been exceeded, and it does not reset the buffer size to its initial value. Therefore, if the image data exceeds the buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to craft a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large image with a high resolution. The image data can be crafted to exceed the buffer size of the `ImageStream` object, causing a buffer overflow and potentially executing arbitrary code.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ceil` function to calculate the size of the `cairo_data` buffer. If the `width` or `height` values are very large, the resulting `cairo_width` or `cairo_height` values can overflow the integer type, leading to a buffer overflow. This can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

177792,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the calculation of the rowSize variable. The rowSize variable is calculated as follows:

rowSize = (width + 7) >> 3;

If the width variable is large enough, the result of the expression (width + 7) will be greater than 2^31-1, which is the maximum value that can be represented by an integer in C++. When this happens, the result of the expression will be negative, which will cause an integer overflow.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a PDF file with a large value for the width variable, which will cause the rowSize variable to overflow and result in a negative value. This will cause the data pointer to be set to a negative value, which will cause a crash when the application tries to access the memory at that location.

The vulnerability can be mitigated by using a larger integer type, such as long or long long, to store the rowSize variable. Alternatively, the vulnerability can be fixed by using a more robust method to calculate the rowSize variable, such as using the ceil() function","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the FT_Load_Glyph function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input glyph index is too large. The function takes an FT_UInt as input, which is an unsigned integer type. However, the function does not perform any bounds checking on the input value, which means that an attacker can potentially overflow the buffer by providing a large value for the glyph index.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a crafted PDF file that contains a large glyph index value. The attacker could then use this value to overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the Poppler developers should perform bounds checking on the input glyph index value and prevent the buffer overflow. They should also provide a mechanism for the user to disable the use of the FT_Load_Glyph function, which would prevent the vulnerability from being exploited.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input value is too large.

If the input value is too large, the function will return a value that is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input value, but rather a value that is too large to be stored in an integer variable. This can lead to an integer overflow, which can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can provide a specially crafted input value that causes an integer overflow. This can be done by providing a large floating-point number as input to the `splashFloor` function, which will then return a value that is too large to be stored in an integer variable. This can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` and `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macros, which are used to read data from the input stream. However, these macros do not perform any bounds checking on the input data, which can lead to an integer overflow if the input data is too large.

However, if the number of bytes to be read is too large, it can cause an integer overflow, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input stream with a large number of bytes to be read, which can cause the program to read data from an unexpected location in memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
