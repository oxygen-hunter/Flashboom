The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check if the user has the necessary privileges to create a machine account. This can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, as they can create a machine account with the necessary privileges.

The vulnerability can be mitigated by properly checking for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This can be done by checking if the user has the necessary privileges to create a machine account, and if not, denying the request.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the line length.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gets` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input string is too long. The `gets` function does not perform any bounds checking, and it does not provide any mechanism for the user to specify the maximum length of the input string. This means that an attacker can potentially overflow the buffer by providing a long input string, leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted PDF file to the application, which would cause the `gets` function to read beyond the end of the buffer and overflow it. This could potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gmalloc` function, which allocates memory on the heap. If the memory allocation fails, the program will crash. However, the `gmalloc` function does not check for memory allocation failures, and the program will continue to execute with a NULL pointer. This can lead to a buffer overflow when the program attempts to write to the NULL pointer.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large number of pages, each with a large number of pixels.

177786,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the line length. This means that if the image data is corrupted or malicious, it can cause the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the allocated memory, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an exploitable code execution vulnerability.

Additionally, the `drawImage` method also has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the `imgData.lookup` array, which is not properly initialized or bounds checked. This can lead to an exploitable buffer overflow if the image data is corrupted or malicious.

Overall, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability due to the use of the `ImageStream` class and the potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the `drawImage` method.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177787,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer size of 16 bytes, which can be overflowed by a crafted PDF file. If the buffer size is exceeded, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the `imgData.imgStr->reset()` function, which resets the `ImageStream` object to its initial state. However, the `ImageStream` object is not properly initialized, and the buffer size is not properly set. This can cause the buffer to be overflowed, leading to a vulnerability.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to craft a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large image with a large number of pixels. The image data is then read into the `ImageStream` object, which can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is fixed in Poppler 0.10.6 and later versions.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177788,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the ImageStream class, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input stream contains a crafted PDF file. The ImageStream class uses a fixed-size buffer to read data from the input stream, and if the buffer is not large enough to hold the entire image, it can cause a buffer overflow. This can lead to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
imgData.imgStr = new ImageStream(str, width,
                                colorMap->getNumPixelComps(),
                                colorMap->getBits());
```
The ImageStream class uses the width and the number of pixel components to determine the size of the buffer to be allocated. However, the number of pixel components is not properly validated, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input stream contains a crafted PDF file with a large number of pixel components.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a PDF file with a large number of pixel components, which can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The function takes an FT_UInt as input, which is an unsigned integer type. However, the function does not perform any bounds checking on the input value, which means that an attacker can potentially overflow the buffer by providing a large value for the glyph index.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a crafted PDF file that contains a large glyph index value. The attacker could then use this value to overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the Poppler developers should perform bounds checking on the input glyph index value and prevent the buffer overflow. They should also provide a mechanism for the user to disable the use of the FT_Load_Glyph function, which would prevent the vulnerability from being exploited.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The code is a function that takes a 2D vector of integers as input and returns the maximum number of cherries that can be picked up by two k-length paths. The function uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.

The function has a loop that iterates over the rows and columns of the input vector, and it uses a nested loop to iterate over the rows and columns of the input vector. The nested loop has a condition that ensures that the indices of the rows and columns are within the bounds of the input vector.

Therefore, the function does not have any vulnerabilities related to buffer overflow or use-after-free errors.

However, the function does have a potential vulnerability related to integer overflow. The function uses the `max` function to compute the maximum value of the `dp` array, and the `max` function can overflow if the values in the `dp` array are very large. To mitigate this vulnerability, the function could use a more robust method to compute the maximum value of the `dp` array, such as using a custom implementation of the `max` function that checks for overflows.","The code contains a DoS vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input value is too large.

If the input value is too large, the function will return a value that is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input value, but rather a value that is too large to be stored in an integer variable. This can lead to a buffer overflow when the function is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern, as the calculated index may exceed the bounds of the array.
