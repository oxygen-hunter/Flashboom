177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are required to create machine accounts. This allows an attacker to create a machine account with the desired UAC bits set, even if they do not have the necessary rights.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC. The attacker can then create a machine account with the desired UAC bits set, which will bypass intended access restrictions.

The recommended fix is to properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This can be done by checking for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `pow` function in the `solve` function, which can be used to calculate the value of `x^y` for any values of `x` and `y`. If `y` is a large number, the calculation can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can provide a crafted input that causes the `pow` function to calculate a large value of `x^y`, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially arbitrary code execution.

Therefore, it is recommended to use a safe and secure implementation of the `pow` function, such as the `std::pow` function in C++11, to avoid this vulnerability.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `drawMaskedImage` function, which takes a `Stream` object as input and processes it in a way that can lead to a buffer overflow. The function uses the `ImageStream` class to read the image data from the stream, and then processes the data using the `Splash` class. However, the `Splash` class does not properly check the size of the image data, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the image data is too large.

Additionally, the function also uses the `GfxImageColorMap` class to process the image data, which can also lead to a buffer overflow if the color map is too large.

Therefore, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability, which can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large image or color map to cause a buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `pow` function in the `solve` function, which can be used to calculate the value of `x^y` for any values of `x` and `y`. If `y` is a large number, the calculation can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can provide a crafted input with a large value for `y` and a small value for `x`. The `pow` function will calculate the value of `x^y` and store it in the `result` vector. If the value of `y` is large enough, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `atof` function is used to convert the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute to a double value, but the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute is not properly validated. If the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute is not a valid double value, the `atof` function will return a NaN value, which will be assigned to the `m_refreshDelayFactor` variable. This can lead to unintended behavior, including crashes or other vulnerabilities.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly validate the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute before converting it to a double value using `atof`. This can be done by checking if the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute is a valid double value using `std::stod` or other appropriate functions. If the attribute is not a valid double value, an error should be reported and the code should not proceed with the conversion.","The code contains a nan vulnerability.

177850,DoS Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a DoS_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-5289. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `solve` function takes a vector of integers as input and returns a vector of integers as output. The function uses a loop to iterate over the input vector and performs some calculations on each element. However, the loop does not have any bounds checking, which means that it can potentially overflow the stack if the input vector is too large.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can provide a specially crafted input vector that causes the loop to iterate for a very long time, leading to a stack overflow. This can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the `solve` function should be modified to include bounds checking to prevent the loop from iterating for too long. This can be done by using a `size_t` variable to keep track of the number of iterations and checking if it exceeds a certain threshold. If the threshold is exceeded, the function should return an error message.","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

The function `get_line` reads input from a file and stores it in a buffer, but it does not check the size of the buffer before writing to it.

The vulnerability is caused by the `chars_read = get_line ()` line, which reads input from the file and stores it in the `buf` array. However, the function does not check the size of the buffer before writing to it, which means that if the input is too large, it will overflow the buffer and cause undefined behavior.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could provide a specially crafted input file that is larger than the buffer size. This would cause the `get_line` function to overflow the buffer and write data to memory outside of the buffer, potentially leading to a buffer overflow attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the `get_line` function should be modified to check the size of the buffer before writing to it.

177901,Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `str` function, which can write more characters than the buffer can hold. The `str` function does not perform any bounds checking, so it can write beyond the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input that causes the `str` function to write more characters than the buffer can hold. This can cause the program to write data to memory locations that it is not supposed to, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other security vulnerabilities.

To fix the vulnerability, the `str` function should be replaced with a bounds-checked version of the function, such as `strncpy` or `strlcpy`. These functions perform bounds checking and prevent buffer overflows.","The code contains a Overflow vulnerability.

177906,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input number is too large.

If the input number is too large, the function will return a value that is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input number, but rather a value that is too large to be represented as an integer. This can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

For example, if the input number is 1.1, the function will return 0, which is not the largest integer less than or equal to 1.1. This can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To fix the vulnerability, the `splashFloor` function should be modified to check for overflows and return an error value if an overflow occurs. This can be done by using the `std::numeric_limits<int>::max()` function to determine the maximum value that can","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` and `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macros, which are used to read data from the input stream. These macros use the `FT_READ_BYTE` and `FT_READ_USHORT` functions to read data from the stream, but they do not perform any bounds checking on the data they read.

In the code snippet you provided, the `FT_READ_USHORT` function is used to read the `nleft` variable, which is used to determine the number of glyphs in the range. However, the `FT_READ_USHORT` function does not perform any bounds checking on the data it reads, which means that it can read data from the input stream that is outside the bounds of the `nleft` variable.

If the value of `nleft` is large enough, it can cause an integer overflow, which can lead to an out-of-bounds read from the input stream. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, leading to a vulnerability.
