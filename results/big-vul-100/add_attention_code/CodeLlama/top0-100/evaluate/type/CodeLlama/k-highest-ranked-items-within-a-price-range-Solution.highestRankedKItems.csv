The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are required to set the UF_DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWD, UF_ENCRYPTED_TEXT_PASSWORD_ALLOWED, UF_SERVER_TRUST_ACCOUNT, UF_PARTIAL_SECRETS_ACCOUNT, and UF_INTERDOMAIN_TRUST_ACCOUNT bits in the userAccountControl attribute.

The function does not properly check for the presence of these rights, which allows an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions and create machine accounts with the required rights.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gmallocn` function, which allocates memory for an array of `n` elements of size `m`. In this case, the `n` value is derived from the `colorMap->getNumPixelComps()` function, which can return a large value. The `m` value is derived from the `colorMap->getBits()` function, which can also return a large value.

177786,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `drawImage` function, which takes a `width` and `height` parameter and uses them to allocate memory for the image data. If the `width` and `height` parameters are not properly validated, an attacker can potentially cause a buffer overflow by providing a large value for either parameter. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, potentially allowing the attacker to take control of the system or steal sensitive data.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a crafted PDF file that contains a malicious image with a large `width` and `height` parameter. The attacker could then use this image to cause a buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code.

It is important to note that this vulnerability is not limited to the `drawImage` function, but can be found in other functions that use similar techniques to allocate memory for image data. Therefore, it is important to thoroughly review the code and ensure that all user-supplied input is properly validated and sanitized to prevent such vulnerabilities.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `drawMaskedImage` function, which takes a `Stream` object as input and processes it in a way that can lead to a buffer overflow. The function uses the `ImageStream` class to read the input stream, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input stream is too large. Additionally, the function uses the `Splash` class to render the image, which can also lead to a buffer overflow if the image is too large.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a malicious PDF file that contains a large image with a malicious mask. The mask can be used to overflow the buffer used to store the image data, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially a denial of service or code execution.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that the `drawMaskedImage` function is properly validated and sanitized to prevent such vulnerabilities.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer overflow vulnerability, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is caused by the `ImageStream::getNextLine` function, which reads data from the stream into a buffer, but does not check the buffer size before writing to it. This can cause the buffer to overflow, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

The exploit works by sending a crafted PDF file with a large image, which causes the buffer to overflow and execute arbitrary code. The attacker can use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system, leading to a denial of service.

The fix for this vulnerability is to add a check for the buffer size before writing to it. This can be done by using the `std::vector` class, which provides a `reserve` function that can be used to reserve a specific amount of memory for the buffer. The `ImageStream` class can then use this function to check the buffer size before writing to it.

177906,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input value is too large.

If the input value is too large, the function will return a value that is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input value, but rather a value that is too large to fit in the integer range. This can cause the `lineDashStartIdx` variable to take on a value that is not within the bounds of the `state->lineDash` array, leading to a buffer overflow.

The buffer overflow can cause the program to write to memory locations that it is not authorized to access, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute malicious code with elevated privileges, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.

The function `highestRankedKItems` takes in a grid, pricing, and start, and returns the highest ranked k items in the grid. The function uses a BFS to traverse the grid and find the highest ranked k items. The function does not have any buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

The function does have some other issues, such as:

* The function uses a static variable `directions` to store the directions to move in the grid. This can lead to issues if the function is called multiple times in the same program, as the `directions` variable will be reused.
* The function uses a `compare` function to sort the results. This can lead to issues if the `compare` function is not properly defined.
* The function uses a `result` vector to store the results. This can lead to issues if the `result` vector is not properly resized.

177913,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro, which reads the next 32-bit value from the input buffer without performing any bounds checking. This allows an attacker to overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a specially crafted input that causes the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro to read beyond the end of the input buffer. This can be done by providing a large value for the `length` parameter, which is used as the size of the input buffer. If the `length` value is too large, the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro will read beyond the end of the buffer, leading to an overflow.

The vulnerability can be mitigated by properly validating the input buffer size and ensuring that the `length` parameter is not too large. Additionally, the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro should be replaced with a safer alternative that performs bounds checking.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `vector<vector<int>> highestRankedKItems` function, which takes a grid, pricing, and start as input and returns the highest ranked k items in the grid. The function uses a BFS algorithm to traverse the grid and find the highest ranked k items. However, the function does not properly check the size of the grid and the number of items in the grid, which can lead to an overflow if the grid is too large or the number of items is too high.

The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a large grid and a large number of items, which can cause the function to overflow and execute arbitrary code. This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack or a remote code execution vulnerability.

To fix the vulnerability, the function should properly check the size of the grid and the number of items in the grid before traversing the grid. Additionally, the function should use a safer data structure such as a vector of pairs instead of a vector of vectors to store the items.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
