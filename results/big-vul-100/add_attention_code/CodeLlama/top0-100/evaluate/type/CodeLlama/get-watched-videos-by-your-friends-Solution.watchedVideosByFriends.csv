177741,DoS Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

The code is a function that takes in a vector of vectors of strings and a vector of vectors of integers, and returns a vector of strings. It appears to be a function that takes in a user ID and a level, and returns a vector of strings that represent the watched videos by the user and their friends.

The function does not appear to have any buffer overflow vulnerabilities, as it does not involve any string or memory functions that could potentially cause a buffer overflow. Additionally, the function does not appear to have any use-after-free errors, as it does not involve any pointers that are used after they have been deallocated.

However, the function does have a potential memory leak vulnerability. The function allocates memory for the vector of strings that is returned, but it does not free that memory when the function exits. This could lead to a memory leak if the function is called repeatedly, as the memory allocated for the vector of strings would not be freed.

Therefore, the function is vulnerable to a memory leak, but it is not vulnerable to a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

177787,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the code. The function `drawMaskedImage` takes in a `maskWidth` and `maskHeight` as input, and then uses these values to allocate memory for a `SplashBitmap` object. However, if the `maskWidth` or `maskHeight` values are too large, the code can overflow the integer variables and cause a buffer overflow. This can lead to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a malicious PDF file with a large `maskWidth` and `maskHeight` value, causing the `drawMaskedImage` function to allocate a large amount of memory. This can lead to a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the `maskWidth` and `maskHeight` values are properly validated and sanitized before being used to allocate memory. Additionally, the code should use a safer data type, such as a `size_t`, to store the values to prevent integer overflows.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177788,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gets` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input string is too long. The `gets` function does not perform any bounds checking, and it does not provide any mechanism for the user to specify the maximum length of the input string. This means that an attacker can potentially overflow the buffer and cause a crash or arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted input string to the `gets` function, which would cause the buffer to overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code. This could potentially allow the attacker to gain control of the system or steal sensitive information.

To fix this vulnerability, the `gets` function should be replaced with a safer function that performs bounds checking and provides a mechanism for the user to specify the maximum length of the input string. An example of a safer function is `fgets`, which provides a maximum length parameter that can be used to prevent buffer overflows.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ceil` function to calculate the size of the `cairo_data` buffer. If the `width` or `height` values are very large, the calculation of `cairo_width` and `cairo_height` can overflow, leading to a buffer overflow. This can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large `width` or `height` value, causing the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is not related to the `gmalloc` function, which is used to allocate memory for the `cairo_data` buffer. The vulnerability is in the calculation of `cairo_width` and `cairo_height`, which can overflow if the `width` or `height` values are very large.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177792,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the calculation of the rowSize variable. The rowSize variable is calculated as follows:

rowSize = (width + 7) >> 3;

If the width variable is large enough, the result of the expression (width + 7) will be greater than 2^31-1, which is the maximum value that can be represented by an integer in C++. When this happens, the result of the expression will be negative, which will cause an integer overflow.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a PDF file with a large value for the width variable, which will cause the rowSize variable to overflow and result in a negative value. This will cause the data pointer to be set to a negative value, which will cause a crash when the application tries to access the memory at that location.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should use a safer method for calculating the rowSize variable, such as using the modulo operator (%) to ensure that the result is non-negative.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_Load_Glyph` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input glyph index is too large. The function takes an `FT_UInt` parameter, which is an unsigned integer type, and the input glyph index is converted to this type before being passed to the function. However, if the input glyph index is too large, it can cause an integer overflow, leading to a buffer overflow.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large glyph index, which can cause the `FT_Load_Glyph` function to overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability, as the application may crash or behave unexpectedly.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `FT_Load_Glyph` function should be used with caution, and the input glyph index should be validated to ensure that it is within the allowed range.

The code does not contain any buffer overflow vulnerabilities, as it properly checks the size of the input and does not allow the input to exceed the allocated buffer size. Additionally, the code does not use any unsafe functions such as strcpy or sprintf, which are commonly used in buffer overflow attacks.

However, the code does contain a potential use-after-free vulnerability. If the input is a valid JSON object, the code will call the OidOutputFunctionCall function to convert the JSON object to a string. If the OidOutputFunctionCall function returns a string that is longer than the allocated buffer size, the code will overwrite the buffer with the new string, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly check the size of the output string and ensure that it does not exceed the allocated buffer size. Additionally, the code should not use unsafe functions such as strcpy or sprintf, and should instead use safer alternatives such as strncpy or snprintf.","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

The function takes in a vector of vectors of strings and a vector of vectors of integers as input, and it does not perform any input validation or sanitation on these inputs. Therefore, an attacker could potentially send a malicious input to the function, which could cause a denial of service.

177905,DoS,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability is caused by the use of uninitialized memory in the `scaledMask` variable. The `scaleMask` function is called with uninitialized `scaledWidth` and `scaledHeight` variables, which are then used to allocate memory for the `scaledMask` variable. This can lead to a buffer overflow and a crash.

The vulnerability is related to the CWE-416 ""Use After Free"" vulnerability, which occurs when an attacker uses a pointer that has been freed or deallocated. In this case, the `scaledMask` pointer is freed after the `scaledWidth` and `scaledHeight` variables are used to allocate memory for it. This can lead to a crash or other security vulnerabilities if the attacker can manipulate the values of `scaledWidth` and `scaledHeight` to access unallocated memory.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input to the `arbitraryTransformMask` function, which can cause the `scaledMask` pointer to be freed and then accessed. This can lead to a crash or other security vulnerabilities.

The recommended fix is to initialize the `scaledWidth` and `scaledHeight` variables before calling the `scaleMask` function. This can help","The code contains a DoS vulnerability.

177906,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses a fixed-size buffer to store the line dash pattern, which can be manipulated by an attacker to cause a buffer overflow. The attacker can send a specially crafted input that causes the buffer to overflow, leading to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted input that causes the buffer to overflow, leading to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution. The attacker can do this by sending a large line dash pattern that exceeds the size of the fixed-size buffer. Once the buffer overflows, the attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack with the address of a malicious function, causing the program to jump to the malicious function and execute arbitrary code.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by using a dynamically allocated buffer to store the line dash pattern, or by using a secure function like strncpy to copy the line dash pattern into the buffer. Additionally, the code should check the size of the line dash pattern before copying it into the buffer to prevent buffer overflows.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177910,DoS,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a DoS attack. The code is a function that takes in a pointer to a scanner state structure, a pointer to a boolean value, and a pointer to an integer value. It then performs various operations on the scanner state structure and the boolean value, and returns an integer value.

There is no evidence of any buffer overflow or use-after-free vulnerabilities in the code. The code does not appear to have any memory leaks or integer overflow/underflow issues. The code also does not appear to have any null pointer dereferences or improper input validation issues.

However, the code does have a potential race condition vulnerability. The function uses a loop to iterate over the elements of a vector, and it uses a boolean value to determine whether to continue the loop or not. However, the boolean value is not protected by any synchronization mechanism, which means that multiple threads could potentially access the same boolean value simultaneously, leading to race conditions.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the function could be modified to use a synchronization mechanism, such as a mutex or atomic operation, to protect the boolean value from concurrent access.","The code contains a DoS vulnerability.

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `watchedVideosByFriends` function takes a vector of vectors of strings as input, and then iterates over the elements of the vector, and for each element, it creates a new vector of integers and then iterates over the elements of the inner vector, and for each element, it increments a counter. The counter is then used to sort the elements of the inner vector.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `watchedVideosByFriends` function does not properly check the size of the inner vector before iterating over its elements. This means that if the inner vector is very large, the function will iterate over its elements, and for each element, it will increment the counter. This can cause the counter to overflow, leading to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

To fix this vulnerability, the `watchedVideosByFriends` function should properly check the size of the inner vector before iterating over its elements. This can be done by using the `size()` method of the vector to check if the vector is empty before iterating over its elements.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
