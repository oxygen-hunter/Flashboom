The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the code. The function `GfxImageColorMap::GfxImageColorMap` takes an integer `bitsA` as input, which is used to determine the maximum value of the pixel values. If the value of `bitsA` is too large, it can cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect calculation of the maximum pixel value. This can result in a buffer overflow, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
maxPixel = (1 << bits) - 1;
```
If `bits` is a large value, the left shift operation will cause an integer overflow, resulting in a negative value for `maxPixel`. This can lead to a buffer overflow when the `lookup` array is allocated, as the size of the array is determined by `maxPixel`.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream and returns it as a `SplashColorPtr`. The `SplashColorPtr` is a pointer to an array of `SplashColor` objects, which are used to represent the color of each pixel in the image.

The vulnerability occurs when the `ImageStream` class is used to read image data from a stream that contains a crafted image. The crafted image contains a large number of pixels, which can cause the `ImageStream` class to allocate a large amount of memory to store the image data. If the attacker can control the image data, they can potentially cause a buffer overflow by providing a large number of pixels that exceed the maximum size of the buffer allocated to store the image data. This can lead to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer size of 4096 bytes, which can be overflowed by a crafted PDF file. If the image data exceeds this buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the `drawMaskedImage` function, which takes a `Stream` object as an argument and reads the image data from it.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer size of 4096 bytes, which can be overflowed by a crafted PDF file. If the image data exceeds this buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the `imgMaskData.imgStr->reset()` function, which resets the `ImageStream` object to its initial state. However, this function does not check if the buffer size has been exceeded, and it does not reset the buffer size to its initial value. This means that if the image data exceeds the buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to craft a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large image with a large number of pixels.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_Load_Glyph` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input glyph index is too large. The function takes an `FT_UInt` parameter, which is an unsigned integer type, and the input glyph index is converted to this type before being passed to the function. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can cause the function to access memory outside the allocated buffer.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `atof` function to convert a string to a floating-point number. If the string is not a valid floating-point number, the `atof` function returns a NaN (Not a Number) value. However, the code does not properly check for this condition and proceeds to use the NaN value in calculations, leading to unexpected and potentially dangerous behavior.

For example, if the `refreshDelayFactor` attribute is not a valid floating-point number, the `atof` function will return a NaN value, which will be used in the calculation of `m_refreshDelayFactor`. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the `m_refreshDelayFactor` being set to a value that is not intended by the developer.

In addition, the code does not properly check for other potential vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or use-after-free errors, which can also lead to security issues.

The code is a function that takes in a matrix of integers and a number of rows to select, and returns the maximum number of rows that can be selected such that no two selected rows have any common elements. The function uses a bit mask to keep track of the selected rows, and it uses the `next_popcount` function to generate the next bit mask.

The `next_popcount` function is a simple implementation of the next power of 2 algorithm, which is used to generate the next bit mask. It works by finding the lowest bit that is set in the input number, and then adding that bit to the input number. This generates the next bit mask by adding the lowest bit to the input number.

The function then uses the `accumulate` function to count the number of selected rows that have all their elements set in the current bit mask. The `max` function is used to keep track of the maximum number of selected rows that can be selected.

177850,DoS Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a DoS_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-5289. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `maximumRows` function takes an integer `numSelect` as an argument, and then uses a loop to iterate over all possible bitmasks of length `numSelect` that can be formed using the elements of the `matrix` vector. The function then counts the number of rows in the matrix that have a 1 in each bit position corresponding to a 1 in the bitmask, and returns the maximum count.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `next_popcount` function used in the loop has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `matrix` vector. This means that the time complexity of the `maximumRows` function is O(2^n), which can be very slow for large values of n.

In particular, if the `numSelect` argument is set to a large value, the loop will iterate over a large number of bitmasks, and the time complexity of the function will be very high.

This means that the function can take a very long time to execute for large matrices, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `next_popcount` function used in the `maximumRows` function has a time complexity of O(2^n), which makes the function very slow for large matrices. This slowness can be exploited by an attacker to launch a DoS attack by sending a large matrix to the function. The attacker can cause the function to take a very long time to execute, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashDist` function, which calculates the distance between two points. The function uses the `sqrt` function to calculate the distance, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the distance is too large. The buffer overflow can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input to the `makeDashedPath` function, which can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code. The input should be a path with a large number of points, and the distance between each point should be calculated using the `splashDist` function. If the distance is too large, it can cause a buffer overflow, leading to a vulnerability.

To fix the vulnerability, the `splashDist` function should be modified to use a more secure method of calculating the distance, such as the Euclidean distance formula.

177923,Bypass,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability. The code checks the input parameters for null or empty values, and it also checks if the file exists before moving it. Additionally, it checks if the new path is within the open_basedir, if it is set.

The code also uses the php_check_open_basedir function to check if the new path is within the open_basedir, if it is set. This function checks if the new path is within the open_basedir, and if it is not, it returns false.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-2348. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.
Vulnerability summary:
The move_uploaded_file implementation in ext/standard/basic_functions.c in PHP before 5.4.39, 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 truncates a pathname upon encountering a \x00 character, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended extension restrictions and create files with unexpected names via a crafted second argument.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-7243.

177926,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code does not contain any integer overflows or underflows, and the input data is properly validated and sanitized. The code also properly checks for null pointers before dereferencing them, and uses proper error handling mechanisms to prevent crashes or unpredictable behavior.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0586. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.
Vulnerability summary:
Integer overflow in the gst_vorbis_tag_add_coverart function (gst-libs/gst/tag/gstvorbistag.c) in vorbistag in gst-plugins-base (aka gstreamer-plugins-base) before 0.10.23 in GStreamer allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted COVERART tag that is converted from a base64 representation, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.

177927,,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a nan vulnerability. The code is a C++ function that implements the OpenSSL sealing algorithm for encrypting data using public keys. It does not contain any nan vulnerabilities.","The code contains a nan vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2017-11144. The CWE-ID is CWE-754.
Vulnerability summary:
In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, the openssl extension PEM sealing code did not check the return value of the OpenSSL sealing function, which could lead to a crash of the PHP interpreter, related to an interpretation conflict for a negative number in ext/openssl/openssl.c, and an OpenSSL documentation omission.
