177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are necessary to create machine accounts. The function assumes that the user has the necessary rights, but this is not always the case.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC. The attacker can then use this vulnerability to create machine accounts with the necessary rights, which can bypass intended access restrictions.

The recommended fix is to properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This can be done by checking for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

This can lead to a denial of service (application crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the `ImageStream` class should perform bounds checking on the length of the line before reading it into the buffer. This can be done by checking the length of the line against the maximum allowed length, and if it exceeds the maximum, the `getLine` method should return an error instead of reading the entire payload into the","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the ImageStream class, which can cause a buffer overflow if the image data is maliciously crafted. The code does not properly check the size of the image data, which can lead to a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
imgData.imgStr = new ImageStream(str, width,
                                colorMap->getNumPixelComps(),

```
The ImageStream class does not properly check the size of the image data, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the image data is maliciously crafted. This can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly check the size of the image data before allocating memory for it. This can be done by using the ImageStream::getSize() method to get the size of the image data and then allocating memory for it.

Additionally, the code should also properly check the size of the mask data before allocating memory for it. This can be done by using","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the ImageStream class, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input stream contains a crafted PDF file. The ImageStream class uses a fixed-size buffer to read data from the input stream, and if the buffer is not large enough to hold the entire image, it can cause a buffer overflow. This can lead to a crash of the application or potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
imgData.imgStr = new ImageStream(str, width,
				   colorMap->getNumPixelComps(),
				   colorMap->getBits());
```
The ImageStream class uses the width, colorMap->getNumPixelComps(), and colorMap->getBits() parameters to determine the size of the buffer to be allocated. However, these parameters are not properly validated, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input stream contains a crafted PDF file.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the LZW decompressor in the BufCompressedFill function does not properly handle code words that are absent from the decompression table when encountered.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `strcpy` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the destination buffer is not large enough to hold the source string.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashDist` function, which calculates the distance between two points. The function takes two `SplashCoord` arguments, `x0` and `y0`, and returns the distance between them. However, the function does not properly validate the input values, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input values are too large.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input to the `splashDist` function, which causes the function to write to memory outside the bounds of the allocated buffer. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `splashDist` function should be modified to properly validate the input values, and to ensure that the input values are not too large.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `substr` function in the `shortestSuperstring` function. The `substr` function takes two arguments: the first is the starting position of the substring, and the second is the length of the substring. The function returns a substring of the original string starting from the specified position and with the specified length.

In the `shortestSuperstring` function, the `substr` function is used to extract a substring from the `A[i]` string.

The second argument of the `substr` function is the length of the `A[j]` string, which is `A[j].length()`.

The vulnerability arises when the length of the `A[i]` string is greater than the length of the `A[j]` string.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gets` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the user enters more characters than the buffer can hold. The `gets` function does not perform any bounds checking, and the buffer is not initialized to a known value, which makes it vulnerable to attacks.

The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by entering a long string of characters, which will cause the buffer to overflow and overwrite the return address on the stack. The overwritten return address will then point to a malicious function, which can be executed when the `gets` function returns. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, which can be used to gain unauthorized access to the system or steal sensitive information.

To fix this vulnerability, the `gets` function should be replaced with a safer function that performs bounds checking, such as `fgets` or `getline`. Additionally, the buffer should be initialized to a known value to prevent the vulnerability.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The function `shortestSuperstring` takes a vector of strings as input and returns a string that is the shortest superstring of all the input strings. The function uses a recursive approach to find the shortest superstring, and it has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `overlaps` array.

The `overlaps` array is used to store the length of the overlap between two strings. The function uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible pairs of strings and calculates the overlap between them. However, the function does not check the size of the `overlaps` array before writing to it, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input vector has a large number of strings.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted input vector to the `shortestSuperstring` function that has a large number of strings. Each string in the input vector can be a large string that is longer than the maximum size of the `overlaps` array. When the function calculates the overlap between two strings, it writes the result to the `overlaps` array, which can overflow the buffer and cause a buffer overflow.
