The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are required to set the UF_SERVER_TRUST_ACCOUNT and UF_PARTIAL_SECRETS_ACCOUNT bits in the userAccountControl attribute. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended access restrictions and create a machine account with these bits set, which can lead to unintended consequences.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

The code is using the `estrdup` function to allocate memory for the `strbuf` variable, which is a buffer that is used to store the time string. The `estrdup` function is a wrapper around the `malloc` function, which allocates memory from the heap. The memory allocated by `estrdup` is not freed until the `strbuf` variable goes out of scope, which is when the function returns. Therefore, there is no memory leak in the code.

Furthermore, the code is not using any deprecated or insecure functions, such as `strcpy`, `gets`, or `scanf`. It is using the `snprintf` function to format the time string, which is a safer alternative to `sprintf`.

The code is also not using any improper error handling mechanisms, such as ignoring or mishandling exceptions or errors. It is using the `php_error_docref` function to log errors, which is a safer alternative to `printf` or `fprintf`.

177786,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `dieSimulator` function, which takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of possible outcomes of rolling `n` dice. The function uses a recursive approach to calculate the number of possible outcomes, and the `rollMax` vector is used to store the maximum number of times each die can be rolled.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `rollMax` vector, which can be manipulated by an attacker to cause a buffer overflow. The `rollMax` vector is used to store the maximum number of times each die can be rolled, and the function uses a recursive approach to calculate the number of possible outcomes. If the `rollMax` vector is manipulated to have a large number of elements, the function can cause a buffer overflow, leading to a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a crafted PDF file with a large number of dice rolls, causing the `rollMax` vector to overflow. This can lead to a crash of the application, or potentially allow an attacker to execute","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `dieSimulator` function, which takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of possible outcomes of rolling `n` six-sided dice. The function uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible outcomes, and it has a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a fixed-size array to store the results of the calculations.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a large value of `n` to the `dieSimulator` function, which will cause the function to overflow the buffer and write to memory outside of the allocated space. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code into the program.

To fix the vulnerability, the `dieSimulator` function should be modified to use a dynamically allocated array to store the results of the calculations, or to use a different approach to calculate the number of possible outcomes that does not involve a buffer overflow.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `dieSimulator` function, which takes an integer `n` and a vector of integers `rollMax` as input. The function then simulates `n` rolls of a fair six-sided die, where each roll has a maximum value of `rollMax[i]`. The function returns the number of possible outcomes for each roll.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `accumulate` function, which is used to calculate the total number of possible outcomes for each roll. The `accumulate` function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack, as it can cause the function to write beyond the end of the `rollMax` vector. This can lead to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can provide a large value for `n` and a vector of integers with a large number of elements.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_Load_Glyph` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input glyph index is too large. The function takes an `FT_UInt` parameter, which is an unsigned integer, and the input glyph index is converted to an `FT_UInt` value. However, if the input glyph index is too large, it can cause an integer overflow, leading to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large glyph index, which can cause the `FT_Load_Glyph` function to overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, as the application may crash or behave unexpectedly.

To fix the vulnerability, the `FT_Load_Glyph` function should be modified to check for integer overflows and prevent buffer overflows.

177850,DoS Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-5289. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `datum_to_json` function does not properly handle the `key_scalar` parameter, which is used to determine whether the input value is a scalar or not. If the input value is a scalar, the function does not properly escape the output string, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input value that causes the `datum_to_json` function to write more data to the output buffer than it is supposed to. This can cause the buffer to overflow, leading to a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability.

To fix the vulnerability, the `datum_to_json` function should properly check the `key_scalar` parameter and only escape the output string if it is a scalar value. This can be done by adding a check for `key_scalar` before the `escape_json` call.","The code contains a DoS_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code checks the parent directory's stat value to ensure that it is the same as the parent directory's stat value. However, this check is not performed on the parent directory's parent directory, which can lead to a bypass of the intended file-access restrictions.

For example, if the parent directory is a symlink to a directory outside of the share, the check will pass, even though the parent directory's parent directory is not a symlink to a directory outside of the share.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The `splashFloor` function is used to round the `lineDashStartPhase` value down to the nearest integer.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `dieSimulator` function, which takes an integer `n` as input and uses it to calculate the number of possible outcomes for a dice roll. The function uses a recursive approach to calculate the number of possible outcomes, and the `rollMax` vector is used to store the maximum number of times each die can be rolled.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `rollMax` vector, which is not properly initialized. The `rollMax` vector is used to store the maximum number of times each die can be rolled, but it is not initialized to any specific value. As a result, the `dieSimulator` function can potentially overflow the stack if the `n` input is large enough.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can provide a large value for the `n` input, causing the `dieSimulator` function to recurse deeply and overflow the stack. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing the attacker to execute malicious code with the same privileges as the application.
