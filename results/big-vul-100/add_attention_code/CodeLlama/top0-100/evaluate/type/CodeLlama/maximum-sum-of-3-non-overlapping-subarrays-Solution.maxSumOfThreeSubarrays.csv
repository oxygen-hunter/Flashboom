177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are required to set the UF_DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWD, UF_ENCRYPTED_TEXT_PASSWORD_ALLOWED, UF_SERVER_TRUST_ACCOUNT, UF_PARTIAL_SECRETS_ACCOUNT, and UF_INTERDOMAIN_TRUST_ACCOUNT bits in the userAccountControl attribute.

The function does not properly check for the presence of these rights, which allows an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions and create machine accounts with the required rights.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the number of bytes read. This means that if the image data is corrupted or malicious, it can cause the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the stream, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an exploitable code execution vulnerability.

Additionally, the `drawImage` method does not properly validate the `width` and `height` parameters, which can also lead to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a malicious image that has a large width and height, causing the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the stream and overflow the buffer.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the code. The function `GfxImageColorMap::GfxImageColorMap` has a loop that iterates over the number of components in the color space, and for each component, it calculates the maximum pixel value that can be used to index into the lookup table. However, the calculation is done using integer arithmetic, which can result in integer overflows if the maximum pixel value is greater than the maximum value that can be represented by an integer.

If an attacker can control the value of `maxPixel` or the values in `decodeLow` and `decodeRange`, they can potentially cause a buffer overflow by setting `maxPixel` to a large value and manipulating the values in `decodeLow` and `decodeRange` to cause the loop to iterate over a large number of components. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, potentially allowing the attacker to execute malicious commands or inject malicious data into the application.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the number of bytes read. This means that if the image data is corrupted or malicious, it can cause the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the stream, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted PDF file that contains a malicious image with a large number of pixels. The malicious image can be used to cause a buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to a denial of service or other security vulnerabilities.

To fix the vulnerability, the `ImageStream` class should be modified to perform bounds checking on the number of bytes read from the stream. This can be done by checking the number of bytes read against the total number of bytes in the image, and returning an error if the number of bytes read exceeds the total number of bytes in the image.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the ImageStream class, which can cause a buffer overflow if the image data is maliciously crafted. The code does not properly check the size of the image data, which can lead to a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
imgData.imgStr = new ImageStream(str, width,
				     colorMap->getNumPixelComps(),
				     colorMap->getBits());
```
The ImageStream class does not properly check the size of the image data, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the image data is maliciously crafted. This can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly check the size of the image data before allocating memory for it. This can be done by using the ImageStream::getSize() method to get the size of the image data and then allocating memory for it.

Additionally, the code should also properly check the size of the mask data before allocating memory for it.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the ImageStream class, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input stream contains a crafted PDF file. The ImageStream class uses a fixed-size buffer to read data from the input stream, and if the buffer is not large enough to hold the entire image, it can cause a buffer overflow. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, potentially allowing an attacker to cause a denial of service or escalate privileges.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
imgData.imgStr = new ImageStream(str, width,

                                colorMap->getBits());
```
The ImageStream class uses the width, height, and bits parameters to determine the size of the buffer to be allocated. However, these parameters are not properly validated, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input stream contains a crafted PDF file.

177906,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input value is too large.

If the input value is too large, the function will return a value that is not within the valid range of the integer type, leading to an integer overflow. This can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code, depending on the specific implementation.

In this case, the vulnerability can be exploited by providing a large input value that causes an integer overflow, leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `maxSumOfThreeSubarrays` function, which takes a vector of integers as input and returns a vector of three integers representing the indices of the three subarrays that have the maximum sum. The function uses a naive approach to find the maximum sum, which can lead to integer overflows if the input vector is large enough.

For example, if the input vector has a large number of negative integers, the function can overflow the integer range and return incorrect results. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability, as the function may write data to memory locations that are outside the bounds of the array, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

To fix this vulnerability, the function should use a more robust approach to find the maximum sum, such as using a divide-and-conquer algorithm or a dynamic programming approach. This will ensure that the function does not overflow the integer range and is more reliable.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strcpy` function, which can copy more characters than the destination buffer can hold.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input string that is longer than the destination buffer. The attacker can use this to overwrite the return address on the stack, allowing them to execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the `strcpy` function should be replaced with a safer function that performs bounds checking, such as `strncpy`.
