The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of data from the stream and returns it as a string. However, the `getLine` method does not perform any bounds checking on the length of the string, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the string is too long.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PDF file that contains a large image with a malicious string.

This can be done by using the `strlen` function to determine the length of the string and then checking if it exceeds the maximum allowed length.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `strcpy` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the destination buffer is not large enough to hold the source string. In this case, the destination buffer is `buffer`, which is allocated to be `width * height * 4` bytes in size. However, the `strcpy` function is used to copy the source string `s` into the destination buffer, which can cause the destination buffer to overflow if the source string is too large.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large string in the `s` variable. If the string is larger than the destination buffer, it can cause a buffer overflow, leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should use a safer function to copy the source string into the destination buffer, such as `strncpy` or `memcpy`.

The `tmp_line` variable is then used in the `colorSpace2->getRGBLine` function, which can lead to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in CVE-2009-0791, but the attacker can exploit it by providing a large value for the `length` parameter in the `getRGBLine` function.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of data from the stream and returns it as a string. However, the `getLine` method does not perform any bounds checking on the length of the string, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the string is too long.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PDF file that contains a large image with a malicious string. The string can be made large enough to overflow the buffer and cause a buffer overflow. Once the buffer overflow occurs, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system.

To fix this vulnerability, the `ImageStream` class should perform bounds checking on the length of the string returned by the `getLine` method. This can be done by using the `strlen` function to determine the length of the string and then checking if it exceeds the maximum allowed length. If the length exceeds the maximum allowed length, the `getLine` method should return an error instead of the string.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer size of 4096 bytes, which can be overflowed by a crafted PDF file. If the buffer size is exceeded, the `ImageStream` class will read data from the stream into the buffer, potentially causing a buffer overflow. This can lead to an application crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is caused by the `drawMaskedImage` function, which uses the `ImageStream` class to read image data from a stream. The function also uses the `maskWidth` and `maskHeight` parameters to determine the size of the mask, and it does not perform any bounds checking on these parameters. This means that an attacker can craft a PDF file with a large mask width and height, which can cause a buffer overflow and lead to a vulnerability.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to craft a PDF file with a large mask width and height, and then use the `ImageStream` class to read the image data from the stream.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a buffer size of 4096 bytes, which can be overflowed by a crafted PDF file. If the buffer size is exceeded, the application will crash or execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the `imgMaskData.imgStr->reset()` function, which resets the `ImageStream` object to its initial state. However, the `ImageStream` object is not properly initialized, which allows the buffer size to be exceeded.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to craft a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large image mask. The image mask is used to create a soft mask for the image, which is then applied to the image. The attacker can control the size of the image mask, which can be used to overflow the buffer size of the `ImageStream` object.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strcpy` function, which can copy more characters than the destination buffer can hold. This can lead to an overflow of the buffer, resulting in unpredictable behavior and potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
strcpy(tempnames, gs_main_tempnames(minst));
```
The `gs_main_tempnames` function returns a string that contains the names of temporary files created by the Ghostscript interpreter. The `strcpy` function is used to copy this string into the `tempnames` variable. However, the `strcpy` function does not perform any bounds checking on the destination buffer, so it can copy more characters than the buffer can hold. This can lead to an overflow of the buffer, resulting in unpredictable behavior and potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a specially crafted PostScript file that contains a long string of characters that can overflow the buffer. This can be done by using a technique called ""format string vulnerability,"" which involves using the `strcpy` function to copy a string that contains a format string with placeholders for additional arguments.

However, the function does not perform any bounds checking on the input, which means that an attacker can provide an input that is longer than 16 bytes, causing the buffer to overflow. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, including code that can cause a crash or execute malicious commands.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strcpy` function, which does not perform any bounds checking on the input. Instead, it blindly copies the input to the output buffer, without checking if the input is larger than the output buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow, as the input can be longer than the output buffer, causing the extra bytes to be overwritten.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `imgCoordMungeLowerC` and `imgCoordMungeUpperC` functions do not properly check the length of the input string. They assume that the input string is a valid coordinate, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is too long.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted input string that is longer than the maximum allowed length. This can cause the `imgCoordMungeLowerC` and `imgCoordMungeUpperC` functions to write beyond the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashDist` function, which calculates the distance between two points.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `partition` function, which takes a string as input and returns a vector of vectors of strings, where each inner vector represents a palindrome in the input string. The function uses a 2D array `p` to store the results of the palindrome detection, and the `for` loop iterates over the characters in the input string to populate the `p` array.

The vulnerability occurs when the input string is a palindrome of length greater than 2^16 - 1, which causes the `p` array to overflow. This results in the `p` array being overwritten with arbitrary data, leading to an exploitable buffer overflow.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input string that is a palindrome of length greater than 2^16 - 1.

177923,Bypass,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability. The code is a function that moves an uploaded file to a new location, and it checks for the existence of the file in the uploaded files hash table before moving it. It also checks for the open_basedir restriction and sets the file mode to 0666.

The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to bypassing the open_basedir restriction or any other security mechanism.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-2348. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.
Vulnerability summary:
The move_uploaded_file implementation in ext/standard/basic_functions.c in PHP before 5.4.39, 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 truncates a pathname upon encountering a \x00 character, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended extension restrictions and create files with unexpected names via a crafted second argument.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-7243.

177926,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code is a function that takes a string as input and returns a vector of vectors of strings that represent the palindromic substrings of the input string. It does not involve any user input or external data, and it does not execute any code. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0586. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.
Vulnerability summary:
Integer overflow in the gst_vorbis_tag_add_coverart function (gst-libs/gst/tag/gstvorbistag.c) in vorbistag in gst-plugins-base (aka gstreamer-plugins-base) before 0.10.23 in GStreamer allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted COVERART tag that is converted from a base64 representation, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.

177927,,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The function takes a string as input and uses the strcpy function to copy the string into a buffer. However, the buffer is not properly sized, which can cause the function to write past the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. This can potentially lead to a crash of the PHP interpreter or other security vulnerabilities.","The code contains a nan vulnerability. 
The CVE-ID is CVE-2017-11144. The CWE-ID is CWE-754.
Vulnerability summary:
In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, the openssl extension PEM sealing code did not check the return value of the OpenSSL sealing function, which could lead to a crash of the PHP interpreter, related to an interpretation conflict for a negative number in ext/openssl/openssl.c, and an OpenSSL documentation omission.
