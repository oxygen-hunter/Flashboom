The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of data from the stream and returns it as a string. However, the `getLine` method does not perform any bounds checking on the length of the string, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the string is too long.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PDF file that contains a large image with a malicious string. The malicious string can cause the `getLine` method to read beyond the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially executing arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the `ImageStream` class should be modified to perform bounds checking on the length of the string returned by the `getLine` method. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the string is not longer than the maximum allowed length, and if it is, then return an error or truncate the string to the maximum allowed length.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177786,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of data from the stream and returns it as a string. However, the method does not perform any bounds checking on the length of the string, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the string is too long.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PDF file that contains a large image with a malicious string. The string can be made large enough to overflow the buffer and cause a buffer overflow. Once the buffer overflow occurs, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system.

This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2009-0791, but it is specific to the `ImageStream` class and the `getLine` method.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the ImageStream class, which can cause a buffer overflow if the image data is maliciously crafted. The code does not properly check the size of the image data, which can lead to a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
imgData.imgStr = new ImageStream(str, width,
				     colorMap->getNumPixelComps(),
				     colorMap->getBits());
```
The ImageStream class does not properly check the size of the image data, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the image data is maliciously crafted. This can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly check the size of the image data before allocating memory for it. This can be done by using the ImageStream::getSize() method to get the size of the image data and then allocating memory for it.

Additionally, the code should also properly check the size of the mask data before allocating memory for it.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the ImageStream class, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input stream contains a crafted PDF file. The ImageStream class uses a fixed-size buffer to read data from the input stream, and if the buffer is not large enough to hold the entire image, it can cause a buffer overflow. This can lead to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
imgData.imgStr = new ImageStream(str, width,

                                colorMap->getBits());
```
The ImageStream class uses the width, height, and bits parameters to determine the size of the buffer to be allocated. However, these parameters are not properly validated, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input stream contains a crafted PDF file.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the FT_Load_Glyph function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input string is too long. The function takes a FT_UInt as input, which is an unsigned integer type. However, the function does not perform any bounds checking on the input value, which can lead to an integer overflow if the input value is too large.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a specially crafted PDF file that contains a very large value for the gid parameter in the FT_Load_Glyph function. This can cause the function to overflow the buffer and write to memory outside of the allocated space, leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability can be mitigated by properly checking the input value for the gid parameter and preventing it from exceeding the maximum value that can be stored in the FT_UInt type.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `atof` function is used to convert a string to a floating-point number, without proper validation. If the input string is not a valid floating-point number, the `atof` function will return a NaN value, which will be assigned to the `m_refreshDelayFactor` variable. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the program, including crashes or incorrect results.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly validate the input string before passing it to the `atof` function.

The reason for this vulnerability is that the `imgCoordMungeLowerC` and `imgCoordMungeUpperC` functions do not perform any bounds checking on the input string, which means that they can write beyond the end of the allocated memory buffer. This can cause the program to overwrite other parts of the memory, potentially leading to a crash or a denial of service.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should perform bounds checking on the input string to ensure that it does not exceed the allocated memory buffer. This can be done by using the `strlen` function to determine the length of the input string and then checking if it exceeds the maximum allowed length.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input value is too large.

If the input value is too large, the function will return a value that is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input value, but rather a value that is too large to be represented by the integer type. This can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

For example, if the input value is 2^31 (which is the largest integer that can be represented by a 32-bit signed integer), the function will return 2^31 - 1, which is a valid integer. However, if the input value is 2^31 + 1, the function will return 2^31, which is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input value.

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `palindromePartition` function, which takes a string `s` and an integer `k` as input. The function calculates the minimum number of changes required to make the string a palindrome by partitioning it into `k` palindromes. The function uses a dynamic programming approach, where it stores the results of previous calculations in a 2D array `dp1` and `dp2`.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `palindromePartition` function uses a recursive approach to calculate the minimum number of changes required to make the string a palindrome. This means that the function can cause a stack overflow if the input string is too large, as the function will recursively call itself with increasingly larger input strings until it reaches the maximum stack size.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted input string that causes the `palindromePartition` function to recurse too deeply, leading to a stack overflow and an execution of arbitrary code. This can be done by sending a string with a large number of characters, which will cause the function","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
