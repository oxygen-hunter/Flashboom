177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The function uses a hardcoded list of GUIDs to check for specific user account control flags, but it does not properly check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended access restrictions and create machine accounts with the desired user account control flags.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted request to the function, which would allow an attacker to create machine accounts with the desired user account control flags. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or system resources.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the number of bytes read. This means that if the image data is corrupted or malicious, it can cause the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the stream, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a malicious image that contains a large number of pixels, causing the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the stream and overflow the buffer. This can be done by sending a specially crafted PDF file that contains a malicious image with a large number of pixels, or by using a specially crafted image file that is not intended to be used with the `ImageStream` class.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses the `ImageStream` class to read image data from a stream, and the `ImageStream` class does not perform bounds checking on the data it reads. This means that if the image data is maliciously crafted, it can cause the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the allocated memory, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to craft a malicious PDF file that contains a specially crafted image with a large number of pixels. The image data would need to be maliciously crafted to cause the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the allocated memory, leading to a buffer overflow. Once the buffer overflow occurs, the attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability.

177788,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the ImageStream class, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input stream contains a crafted PDF file. The ImageStream class uses a fixed-size buffer to read data from the input stream, and if the buffer is not large enough to hold the entire image data, it can cause a buffer overflow. This can lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
imgData.imgStr = new ImageStream(str, width,
                                colorMap->getNumPixelComps(),
                                colorMap->getBits());
```
The ImageStream class uses the width and bits parameters to determine the size of the buffer to be allocated. However, these parameters are not properly validated, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input stream contains a crafted PDF file.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a crafted PDF file with a large width and bits parameter, which can cause the ImageStream class to allocate a large buffer and read data from the input stream beyond the end of the buffer.

The buffer is not properly sized, and the function does not check the size of the input before writing it to the buffer. This can cause the buffer to overflow, leading to a security vulnerability.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `get_line` function does not check the size of the input before writing it to the buffer. This means that if the input is larger than the buffer, it will overflow the buffer and cause undefined behavior. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large input to the `get_line` function, causing the buffer to overflow and potentially leading to a security breach.

To fix this vulnerability, the `get_line` function should be modified to check the size of the input before writing it to the buffer. This can be done by using the `fgets` function, which allows the programmer to specify the maximum size of the input.

The code is a C++ function that parses an XML file using the libxml2 library. It does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, or memory leaks.

However, the code does use the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` function, which can be used to parse XML files from the file system. This can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if the XML file contains malicious data, such as an XML external entity declaration.

To mitigate this risk, the code sets the `PG(allow_url_fopen)` flag to 1, which disables the ability to load XML files from the file system. This is a good practice to follow to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

Overall, the code is not vulnerable to any security vulnerabilities, but it is important to follow best practices when using the libxml2 library to ensure that the code is secure and reliable.","The code contains a +Info vulnerability.

The code is a C++ function that parses an XML file using the libxml2 library. It does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, or memory leaks.

However, the code does contain a potential security vulnerability in the form of an XML External Entity (XXE) injection attack. The vulnerability occurs when an attacker can control the XML file being parsed, and they can inject an XML external entity declaration that references an external resource. This can allow the attacker to read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive data such as passwords or private keys.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the XML file being parsed is validated and sanitized to prevent XXE attacks. This can be done by using a secure XML parser that does not allow external entity references, or by validating the XML file against a trusted schema. Additionally, the code should ensure that the XML file is properly closed and released, and that access controls are in place to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive data.","The code contains a +Info vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point value as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that value. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input value is too large.

If the input value is too large, the function will return a value that is outside the range of the `lineDashIdx` variable, which is used to index into the `state->lineDash` array. This can cause the program to access memory outside the allocated bounds, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted input that causes the `splashFloor` function to return a large value, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially arbitrary code execution.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
