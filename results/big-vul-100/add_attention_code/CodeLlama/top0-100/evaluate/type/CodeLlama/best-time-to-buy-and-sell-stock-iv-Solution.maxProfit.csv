177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
if (prices[v] < prices[v + 1]) {
    break;
}
```
This line of code is used to check if the current price is less than the next price, which is not a secure way to check for buffer overflows. A malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted input that causes the function to read beyond the end of the array, leading to a buffer overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, the function should use a secure way to check for buffer overflows, such as using a secure function like strcpy_s or memcpy_s, or by using a secure library like OpenSSL.","The code contains a Bypass vulnerability.

The code checks if the directory name is a substring of the file name, and if it is, it adds the file to the directory. This check is done using the `strncmp` function, which compares the first `n` characters of two strings. The `n` parameter is set to the length of the directory name, which is `dirlen`. This means that the function will only compare the first `dirlen` characters of the file name with the directory name.

If the file name is longer than `dirlen` characters, the function will not compare the remaining characters with the directory name, and will instead add the file to the directory. This means that the function will not be vulnerable to a DoS attack, as it will not be able to compare the entire file name with the directory name.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `new` operator to allocate memory for the `imgData.lookup` variable, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the number of elements in the `colorMap` is large. The `imgData.lookup` variable is used to store the color values for each pixel, and the number of elements in the `colorMap` determines the size of the `imgData.lookup` array. If the number of elements in the `colorMap` is large, the `imgData.lookup` array can overflow, leading to a buffer overflow.

Furthermore, the `imgData.lookup` array is not properly initialized, which can lead to unpredictable behavior.

177787,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses the `drawMaskedImage` function to draw an image with a mask. The mask is used to determine which parts of the image are visible, and the code uses the `maskedImageSrc` function to apply the mask to the image. However, the code does not properly validate the size of the mask, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the mask is too large.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PDF file that contains a large mask, which can cause the buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, as well as the ability to execute arbitrary code on the system.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly validate the size of the mask and ensure that it does not exceed the size of the image. This can be done by checking the size of the mask against the size of the image and ensuring that the mask is not larger than the image. Additionally, the code should use a secure library for handling images and masks to prevent buffer overflows and other vulnerabilities.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the ImageStream class, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input stream contains a crafted PDF file. The ImageStream class uses a fixed-size buffer to read data from the input stream, and if the buffer is not large enough to hold the entire image data, it can cause a buffer overflow. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, potentially allowing an attacker to cause a denial of service or escalate privileges.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the ImageStream class in the drawSoftMaskedImage function, which is used to draw a soft masked image. The ImageStream class is used to read the image data from the input stream, and if the input stream contains a crafted PDF file, it can cause a buffer overflow.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a crafted PDF file to the application, which would cause the buffer overflow and potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code. This could potentially allow the attacker to cause a denial of service or escalate privileges, depending on the context in which the application is being used.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ceil` function to calculate the width and height of the cairo surface. If the input values are too large, the `ceil` function can overflow, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an executable code overflow.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large width and height value, which can cause the `ceil` function to overflow and the program to crash. This can be done by sending a malicious PDF file with a large width and height value, which can cause the `ceil` function to overflow and the program to crash.

To fix the vulnerability, the `ceil` function should be replaced with a safe function that can handle large input values without overflowing.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_Load_Glyph` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input glyph index is too large. The function takes an `FT_UInt` parameter, which is an unsigned integer, but the code checks if the input is less than `ff->codeToGIDLen`, which is a signed integer. This allows an attacker to send a crafted PDF file with a large glyph index, causing a buffer overflow and potentially executing arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is related to the following code:
```
if (ff->codeToGID && c < ff->codeToGIDLen) {
    gid = (FT_UInt)ff->codeToGID[c];
} else {
    gid = (FT_UInt)c;
}
```
The `ff->codeToGID` array is used to map Unicode code points to glyph indices, but the code does not check if the input code point is less than the length of the array, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input code point is too large.

177795,,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function takes a user-supplied string as input, and then copies it into a buffer without any bounds checking. This means that if the user-supplied string is longer than the buffer, it will overflow the buffer and overwrite the return address on the stack. This can allow an attacker to redirect the program's control flow to a malicious location, leading to arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is in the line `auto_ptr_char s(child->getFirstChild()->getNodeValue());`. The `getNodeValue()` method returns a pointer to the string value of the node, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the string. This means that if the string is longer than the buffer, it will overflow the buffer and overwrite the return address on the stack.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a specially crafted string that is longer than the buffer. This could be done by sending a specially crafted XML document to the program, or by using a specially crafted input to the program's command line interface. Once the attacker has successfully overflowed the buffer, they can redirect the program's control flow to a malicious location, leading to arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses a fixed-size buffer to store the line dash pattern, which can be manipulated by an attacker to cause a buffer overflow. The attacker can send a specially crafted input that causes the buffer to overflow, leading to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted input that causes the buffer to overflow, leading to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro to read 32-bit values from the input buffer, without checking the bounds of the input buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input buffer is not properly validated.

The `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro is defined as follows:
```
#define TT_NEXT_ULONG( p )  ( (p) += 4, (FT_UInt32)( ( (p)[-4] << 24 ) | ( (p)[-3] << 16 ) | ( (p)[-2] << 8 ) | (p)[-1] ) )
```
This macro assumes that the input buffer is at least 4 bytes long, and it reads the next 32-bit value from the input buffer by shifting the bytes in the buffer by 24, 16, 8, and 0 bits, respectively.

However, if the input buffer is not properly validated, an attacker can provide a malicious input that is shorter than 4 bytes","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

However, the `nth_element` function is not properly bounded, and can potentially cause an overflow if the input vector is large enough.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can provide a large value for `k`, causing the `nth_element` function to access memory outside the bounds of the input vector. This can lead to an overflow, which can be used to execute arbitrary code.
