The vulnerability arises from the use of the `drawImage` function, which takes a `width` and `height` parameter and uses them to allocate memory for the image data. If the `width` or `height` parameter is negative, the function will allocate a large amount of memory, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an executable code overflow.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a malicious image that has a negative `width` or `height` parameter. The attacker can use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (application crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code.

The code is vulnerable because it does not properly validate the `width` and `height` parameters before using them to allocate memory. It is important to ensure that all user-supplied input is validated and sanitized to prevent such vulnerabilities.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses the ImageStream class to read the image data from the input stream. The ImageStream class uses a buffer to store the image data, and the buffer size is determined by the width and height of the image. If the width or height of the image is very large, the buffer size can become very large, leading to a buffer overflow.

The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PDF file with a large image that requires a large buffer to store the image data. The buffer overflow can cause the application to write data to memory outside the allocated buffer, leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should limit the maximum buffer size used by the ImageStream class. Alternatively, the application can use a secure implementation of the ImageStream class that checks for buffer overflows and prevents them from occurring.","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177788,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-3605. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the ImageStream class, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input stream contains a crafted PDF file. The ImageStream class uses a fixed-size buffer to read data from the input stream, and if the buffer is not large enough to hold the entire image, it can cause a buffer overflow. This can lead to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
imgData.imgStr = new ImageStream(str, width,
                                colorMap->getNumPixelComps(),
                                colorMap->getBits());
```
The ImageStream class uses the width, height, and bits parameters to determine the size of the buffer to be allocated. However, if the input stream contains a crafted PDF file with a large width, height, or bits value, it can cause a buffer overflow.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to send a crafted PDF file with a large width, height, or bits value to the application. The application will then allocate a buffer of the specified size","The code contains a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the FT_Load_Glyph function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input glyph ID is too large. The function takes an FT_UInt as input, which is an unsigned integer type. However, the function does not perform any bounds checking on the input value, which means that an attacker can potentially overflow the buffer by providing a large value for the gid parameter.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a crafted PDF file that contains a large glyph ID for a specific character. The attacker would then need to manipulate the font file to cause the FT_Load_Glyph function to overflow the buffer. This can be done by providing a crafted font file that contains a large number of glyphs, each with a large glyph ID. The attacker would then need to manipulate the PDF file to reference the crafted glyph ID for the specific character they want to exploit.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `minAbsDifference` function uses the `lower_bound` function to find the closest value in the `sorted_sums1` vector to the `goal` value. However, the `lower_bound` function does not check for the presence of the `goal` value in the vector, which can lead to a situation where the `result` variable is not properly initialized.

In particular, if the `goal` value is not present in the `sorted_sums1` vector, the `lower_bound` function will return an iterator pointing to the first element that is greater than the `goal` value. In this case, the `result` variable will not be properly initialized, leading to a nan vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, the `minAbsDifference` function should check if the `goal` value is present in the `sorted_sums1` vector before using the `lower_bound` function.

The code is a function that takes a string and escapes it for use in a DN (Distinguished Name) in LDAP. It does this by replacing certain characters with their escaped versions, such as backslashes and spaces. It also checks for the presence of certain characters that must be escaped using the \c form, such as question marks.

The code does not appear to have any vulnerabilities related to buffer overflows, use after free, memory leaks, integer overflow/underflow, null pointer dereferences, improper input validation, race conditions, insecure function usage, insecure resource management, or improper error handling.

However, the code does have a potential vulnerability related to sensitive data exposure. The function takes a string as input and returns a string as output, and the output string contains the escaped version of the input string. This means that if the input string contains sensitive data, such as a password or a private key, the output string will also contain this sensitive data. This could potentially expose the sensitive data to an attacker if the output string is not properly secured.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the output string should be properly secured, such as by encrypting it or by limiting access to it. Additionally, the input string should be properly validated to ensure that it does not contain any sensitive data that should be protected.","The code contains a +Info vulnerability.

The code checks the length of the input buffer and the number of groups in the table, and then iterates over the groups to check if they are in increasing order. It also checks if the start and end values of each group are within the valid range.

There is no code that could potentially lead to an overflow, as the code checks the input values and the length of the buffer before accessing any data. Additionally, the code uses the `FT_NEXT_ULONG` macro to read the values from the buffer, which ensures that the values are read correctly and safely.

177913,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro is used to read 32-bit values from the input buffer, but it does not perform any bounds checking. This means that if the input buffer is not properly initialized or if it contains invalid data, the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro can read beyond the end of the buffer, leading to an overflow.

Furthermore, the code also uses the `FT_INVALID_TOO_SHORT` macro to indicate that the input buffer is too short, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the input buffer size. This means that if the input buffer is too short, the `FT_INVALID_TOO_SHORT` macro can be triggered, leading to an overflow.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input buffer that is too short, leading to an overflow and arbitrary code execution.","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `minAbsDifference` function, which takes a vector of integers as input and returns the minimum absolute difference between the sum of the elements in the vector and a given goal. The function has a time complexity of O(n * 2^(n/2)), which can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `lower_bound` function, which has a time complexity of O(2^(n/2)) when the vector is sorted. This means that the time complexity of the `minAbsDifference` function can be reduced to O(2^(n/2)) when the vector is sorted, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the goal is set to a large value.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a vector of integers with a large sum and a goal that is close to the sum. The `minAbsDifference` function will then return a large value, which can cause a buffer overflow if the goal is set to a large value.

Therefore, it is recommended to fix the vulnerability by sorting the vector before calling","The code contains a Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.
