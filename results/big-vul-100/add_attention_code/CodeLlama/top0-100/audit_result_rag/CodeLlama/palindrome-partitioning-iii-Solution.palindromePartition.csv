Vulnerability summary:
vfs.c in smbd in Samba 3.x and 4.x before 4.1.22, 4.2.x before 4.2.7, and 4.3.x before 4.3.3, when share names with certain substring relationships exist, allows remote attackers to bypass intended file-access restrictions via a symlink that points outside of a share.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the ""privilege_paths"" structure, which is used to store the parent directory and file name of a given path. The code checks if the parent directory and file name are the same after the parent directory is changed, which can lead to a bypass of intended file-access restrictions.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input value is too large.

If the input value is too large, the function will return a value that is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input value, but rather a value that is too large to be represented by the integer type. This can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

For example, if the input value is 2^31 (which is the largest integer that can be represented by a 32-bit signed integer), the function will return 2^31 - 1, which is a valid integer. However, if the input value is 2^31 + 1, the function will return 2^31, which is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input value.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `palindromePartition` function, which takes a string `s` and an integer `k` as input. The function calculates the minimum number of changes required to make the string a palindrome by partitioning it into `k` palindromes. The function uses a dynamic programming approach, where it stores the results of previous calculations in a 2D array `dp1` and `dp2`.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `palindromePartition` function uses a recursive approach to calculate the minimum number of changes required to make the string a palindrome. This means that the function can cause a stack overflow if the input string is too large, as the function will recursively call itself with increasingly larger input strings until it reaches the maximum stack size.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted input string that causes the `palindromePartition` function to recurse too deeply, leading to a stack overflow and an execution of arbitrary code. This can be done by sending a string with a large number of characters, which will cause the function",2137,301,11.731233358383179

177923,Bypass,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability. The code checks the input parameters for null or empty values before using them, and it also checks the input parameters for proper length before using them. Additionally, the code uses the `zend_parse_parameters` function to parse the input parameters, which checks for the correct number and types of parameters.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability.",1921,97,4.189625263214111
