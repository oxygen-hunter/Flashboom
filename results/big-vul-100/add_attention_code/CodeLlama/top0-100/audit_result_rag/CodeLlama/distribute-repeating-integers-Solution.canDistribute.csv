177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
if (requirement[submask] <= cnts[i] && dp[i % 2][mask ^ submask]) {
    dp[(i + 1) % 2][mask] = 1;
}
```
Here, the function checks if the requirement for a particular submask is met, and if so, sets the corresponding bit in the result vector. However, the check is not properly implemented, and the function does not take into account the possibility that the requirement may be met due to the presence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC.

Therefore, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, and then using the function",2747,301,11.98042368888855

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `getLine` function in the `ImageStream` class, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input stream contains more data than the buffer can hold. The `getLine` function does not perform any bounds checking on the input data, and instead relies on the caller to ensure that the input data is valid.

The `drawImage` function in the `ArthurOutputDev` class uses the `getLine` function to read data from the input stream and store it in a buffer. The buffer is then used to create a `QImage` object, which is then drawn to the screen.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large amount of data in the image stream. The data in the image stream can cause the buffer to overflow, leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `ImageStream` class should be modified to perform bounds checking on the input data, or the `drawImage` function should be modified to use a fixed-size buffer instead of dynamically allocating memory.",2710,296,11.595436811447144

The `cairo_pattern_t` is created from a `cairo_surface_t` using the `cairo_pattern_create_for_surface` function. The `cairo_surface_t` is created from a `unsigned char *` buffer using the `cairo_image_surface_create_for_data` function.

The vulnerability occurs when the `cairo_image_surface_create_for_data` function is called with a buffer that is too small to hold the image data. The function will then write beyond the end of the buffer, causing a buffer overflow. This can lead to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability occurs in the `canDistribute` function, where the `nums` vector is passed as a parameter to the `canDistribute` function. The `canDistribute` function then uses the `nums` vector to calculate the number of possible combinations of the `quantity` vector. The `canDistribute` function does not perform any bounds checking on the `nums` vector, which means that it can potentially overflow the stack buffer if the `nums` vector is too large.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a specially crafted `nums` vector that is larger than the maximum allowed size. The attacker could then use a buffer overflow attack to overwrite the return address on the stack with the address of a malicious function, which would be executed when the `canDistribute` function returns. This could potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process.

To fix this vulnerability, the `canDistribute` function should perform bounds checking on the `nums` vector to ensure that it is not too large.

177919,nan,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `XListFonts` takes a pattern as input, which is then used to construct a list of font names. The code does not perform any bounds checking on the pattern, which means that an attacker could potentially send a pattern that is longer than the maximum allowed length, causing a buffer overflow. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution or other security vulnerabilities.",2601,92,3.764451026916504
177920,nan,  NO. The code is not vulnerable to a nan vulnerability.,2001,16,0.9735457897186279
177921,nan,  NO. This code is not vulnerable to a nan vulnerability.,2077,16,0.9886245727539062
177922,Exec Code Overflow,  NO,2481,3,0.6219794750213623
177923,Bypass,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability. The code checks the input parameters for null pointer dereferences and performs proper bounds checking. It also checks for buffer overflows and other security vulnerabilities.

However, the code has some potential issues related to memory leaks, use after free, and improper error handling. It is important to review the code carefully and ensure that all memory is properly freed, and that errors are handled properly. Additionally, the code should be reviewed for any potential security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or use after free errors.",2083,125,4.7871716022491455
177926,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code is a function that takes in a list of integers and a list of integers representing the quantity of each integer. It then returns a boolean indicating whether the quantity of each integer can be distributed among the integers in the list.

The function does not appear to have any vulnerabilities related to Exec Code Overflow. The code does not contain any buffer overflows, use after free errors, memory leaks, integer overflows, null pointer dereferences, improper input validation, race conditions, insecure function usage, insecure resource management, improper error handling, cryptographic issues, or sensitive data exposure.

Therefore, the answer to the question ""Is the given code vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow?"" is ""NO"".",2056,169,6.3275628089904785
177927,nan,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a nan vulnerability. The code is a C++ function that implements the OpenSSL PEM sealing algorithm, and it does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to nan.

However, the code does contain some other potential vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, and memory leaks. These vulnerabilities can be addressed by properly validating user inputs, checking for buffer overflows, and ensuring that memory is properly deallocated.

It's important to note that the code is a C++ function, and it's not a PHP function, so it's not vulnerable to the nan vulnerability.",4215,148,5.955625772476196
