177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The function uses a hardcoded list of GUIDs to check for specific user account control flags, but it does not properly check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended access restrictions and create machine accounts with the desired user account control flags.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC. The attacker can then use the hardcoded GUIDs to create machine accounts with the desired user account control flags, which can lead to unauthorized access or escalation of privileges.",2621,257,10.377873420715332

The code is then using the `zend_hash_move_forward` function to move the internal pointer to the next element in the hash table.

The code is not using the `zend_hash_get_current_key_ex` function to get the current key, but rather it is using the `zend_hash_internal_pointer_reset` function to reset the internal pointer to the beginning of the hash table.

It does not have any obvious vulnerabilities related to buffer overflows, use after free, memory leaks, integer overflow/underflow, null pointer dereferences, improper input validation, race conditions, insecure function usage, insecure resource management, or improper error handling.

However, the code does have a potential vulnerability related to the handling of optional attributes. If a path with recognized transitive optional attributes is accepted and passed along to other BGP peers and the Partial bit in the Attribute Flags octet is set to 1 by some previous AS, it is not set back to 0 by the current AS. This could lead to a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability if the Partial bit is not properly handled.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the number of bytes read. This means that if the image data is corrupted or malicious, it can cause the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the stream, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an exploitable code execution vulnerability.

Additionally, the `drawImage` method does not properly validate the `width` and `height` parameters, which can also lead to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted PDF file that contains a malicious image with a large width and height value, which can cause the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the stream and overflow the buffer. This can lead to an exploitable code execution vulnerability, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.",3362,283,11.837973356246948

The `gets` function does not perform any bounds checking, and it does not provide any mechanism for the user to specify the maximum size of the input string. This means that an attacker can potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted input string to the `gets` function, which would cause the buffer to overflow and execute arbitrary code. This could potentially allow the attacker to gain control of the system or steal sensitive data.

It is important to note that this vulnerability is not specific to the `gets` function, but rather a general issue with any function that uses a fixed-size buffer and does not perform bounds checking.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `cairo_matrix_init_translate` function, which takes a `double` argument for the translation value. However, the value is not properly validated, and an attacker can potentially provide a large value that causes a buffer overflow. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, potentially allowing the attacker to take control of the system.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `cairo_matrix_init_translate` function does not check the validity of the `tx` argument, which is the translation value. An attacker can exploit this by providing a large value for `tx`, which will cause the `cairo_matrix_init_translate` function to write beyond the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary code, potentially allowing the attacker to take control of the system.

To fix this vulnerability, the `cairo_matrix_init_translate` function should be modified to properly validate the `tx` argument, and to prevent buffer overflows. This can be done by checking the validity of the `tx",3138,301,11.745855569839478

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses the `splashFloor` function to calculate the index of the line dash pattern, which can lead to an integer overflow if the phase is too large. This can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input that causes the phase to overflow. This can be done by providing a large value for the `lineDashPhase` parameter, which is then passed to the `splashFloor` function. If the value is too large, it will cause an integer overflow, leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` and `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macros, which are used to read data from the input stream. However, these macros do not perform any bounds checking on the input data, which can lead to buffer overflows if the input data is malicious.

In the given code, the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` macro is used to read a large amount of data from the input stream, which can potentially overflow the buffer allocated for the data. Similarly, the `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macro is used to read more data from the input stream, which can also potentially overflow the buffer.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a malicious input stream that contains a large amount of data, which can overflow the buffer allocated for the data. This can lead to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability, which can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.
