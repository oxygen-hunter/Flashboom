The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The function uses a hardcoded list of GUIDs to check for specific user account control flags, but it does not properly check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended access restrictions and create machine accounts with the desired user account control flags.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted request to the function, which would allow an attacker to create machine accounts with the desired user account control flags. This could potentially be used to bypass intended access restrictions and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems.",2537,250,10.714534521102905

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `asn1_time_to_time_t` function does not properly parse the `notBefore` and `notAfter` timestamps in X.509 certificates. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) by crafting a malicious certificate that is not properly handled by the `openssl_x509_parse` function.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `asn1_time_to_time_t` function uses the `atoi` function to parse the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second values from the ASN.1 time string. However, this function does not properly handle the case where the input string is not a valid integer, which can lead to a buffer overflow or other security vulnerability.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to craft a malicious certificate with a valid ASN.1 time string that contains a large number of characters, which would cause the `atoi` function to read beyond",2006,301,12.300887107849121
177741,DoS Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a DoS Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2011-4128. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `gnutls_session_get_data` function takes a `session_data` parameter of type `void *` and a `session_data_size` parameter of type `size_t *`. The function then copies the session data into the `session_data` buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the `session_data` buffer is not large enough to hold the entire session data.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a large session ticket to the server, which can cause the server to allocate a large buffer to store the session data. If the client then sends a large session ticket again, the server will attempt to copy the session data into the buffer again, leading to a buffer overflow and a potential denial of service.

To fix the vulnerability, the `session_data` parameter should be changed to a fixed-size buffer, or the function should be modified to dynamically allocate a buffer large enough to hold the session data. Additionally, the `session_data_size` parameter should be changed to a fixed value, or the function should be modified to dynamically allocate a buffer large enough to hold the session data",1279,301,12.242756843566895

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `gnutls_session_get_data` function takes a `size_t` parameter `session_data_size` and uses it to determine the size of the buffer to be allocated for the session data. However, the function does not check if the value of `session_data_size` is greater than the actual size of the session data, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a large value for `session_data_size` in the `gnutls_session_get_data` function, causing the function to allocate a buffer of the specified size and copy the session data into it. If the value of `session_data_size` is greater than the actual size of the session data, the function will copy data beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

This can cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.",1249,273,10.905779838562012

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the code does not properly check the length of the key before using it to access the manifest hash table. This allows an attacker to include the / filename in the manifest, which causes the code to access memory outside of the allocated buffer. This can lead to a denial of service (uninitialized pointer dereference and application crash) if the attacker is able to include the / filename in a large number of files in the manifest.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `datum_to_json` function does not properly handle the `key_scalar` parameter, which is used to determine whether the current key is a scalar or not. If the `key_scalar` parameter is set to `true`, the function assumes that the current key is a scalar and does not perform any bounds checking on the input string.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input string that is longer than the allocated buffer size. The input string can be crafted to contain a large number of characters, which can cause the buffer to overflow and overwrite the return address on the stack. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control of the program's execution flow.

177855,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-5252. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code allows a symlink to point outside of a share, which can bypass intended file-access restrictions. This can be exploited by creating a symlink that points to a file outside of the share, and then using the symlink to access the file.

The vulnerability is in the `check_reduced_name_with_privilege` function, which checks if a file is within the share or not. The function uses the `SMB_VFS_LSTAT` function to get the stat value of the file, and then checks if the stat value is the same as the stat value of the parent directory. If the stat values are different, the function returns an error.

However, the function does not check if the file is actually within the share or not. This means that if a symlink points to a file outside of the share, the function will still return an error, even though the file is actually within the share.

177856,nan,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `do_ed_script` takes in a file name as input and uses the `editor_program` variable to execute a shell command. The `editor_program` variable is set to the string ""ed"" which is a text editor program. The `editor_program` variable is then used in the `sprintf` function to create a shell command that is executed by the `execl` function. The `sprintf` function takes in a format string and a variable number of arguments, and returns a string that is the result of formatting the format string with the arguments. The format string in this case is ""%s %s%s"", which is a string that contains the editor program name, a space, and the output file name. The output file name is obtained from the `outname` variable, which is a file name that is passed in as an argument to the function.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `sprintf` function does not perform any bounds checking on the format string, and the output file name is not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by passing in a specially crafted file name that contains a format string that is longer than the maximum allowed length, and that contains a buffer overflow attack.

The function takes an untrusted input from the user, and then uses it to determine the size of a buffer that is allocated on the stack. The buffer is then used to store a string, which can potentially overflow the buffer and cause a buffer overflow attack.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strcpy` function, which copies the input string into the buffer without any bounds checking. This means that if the input string is longer than the buffer, it will overwrite the return address on the stack, causing the program to jump to a different location in memory. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, including code to bypass security mechanisms such as ASLR and DEP.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input string that is longer than the buffer, causing it to overflow and overwrite the return address on the stack.

The variable 'temp' is used to store the decrypted data, but it is not initialized before being used. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the decrypted data is larger than the buffer allocated for it.

To fix the vulnerability, the code should initialize the memory before using it. One way to do this is to use the memset function to set the memory to a known value before using it. For example:

memset(temp, 0, sizeof(temp));

This will set the memory to all zeros, which can help prevent buffer overflows.

It is also recommended to use a secure memory allocation function like gs_alloc_bytes_immovable to allocate memory for the aes context. This will help prevent memory corruption and other security vulnerabilities.",2683,286,11.893583536148071

177906,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input value is too large.

If the input value is too large, the function will return a value that is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input value, but rather a value that is too large to be represented by the integer type. This can cause the `lineDashStartIdx` variable to take on a value that is not within the bounds of the `state->lineDash` array, leading to a buffer overflow.

The buffer overflow can cause the program to write to memory locations that it is not authorized to access, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute malicious code with elevated privileges, leading to a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that the input values are properly valid",3055,301,12.692192316055298

177909,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `memset` function to clear the `pixBuf` array. The `memset` function takes a `size` parameter that specifies the number of bytes to be cleared. However, the `size` parameter is not properly validated, and it can be controlled by an attacker. An attacker can send a specially crafted input that causes the `size` parameter to be set to a large value, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially executing arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted input that causes the `size` parameter to be set to a large value, and then send a second specially crafted input that causes the `memset` function to clear the `pixBuf` array. This would overwrite the return address on the stack with a pointer to a shellcode, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the `size` parameter should be properly validated to ensure that it is less than or equal to the size of the `pixBuf` array. Additionally, the `",1791,301,12.110524415969849

The function `XListExtensions` takes a `Display *dpy` as input, and then calls the `XReply` function to read a reply from the server. The `XReply` function reads data from the server into a buffer, which is allocated on the stack. The size of the buffer is determined by the `length` field in the reply, which is an `int` type. However, the `length` field is not properly validated, and it is possible for an attacker to send a reply with a large `length` value, causing the buffer to overflow. This can lead to a crash or other security vulnerabilities.",1846,151,6.21826434135437
177919,nan,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `XListFonts` takes a pattern as an input, which can be a malicious string that is longer than the maximum allowed length. If the pattern is longer than the maximum allowed length, it can cause a buffer overflow, leading to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check the length of the pattern before allocating memory for it. It assumes that the pattern is a null-terminated string, which is not always the case. The function should have checked the length of the pattern before allocating memory for it, and should have used a bounded buffer to prevent buffer overflows.

177922,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strcpy` function, which can copy more characters than the destination buffer can hold, leading to a buffer overflow. This can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
strcpy(param_buffer, *curchar);
```
The `strcpy` function copies the contents of the source buffer to the destination buffer, but it does not check if the destination buffer is large enough to hold the entire source buffer. If the destination buffer is too small, it can cause a buffer overflow, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use a safer function such as `strncpy` or `strlcpy` to copy the contents of the source buffer to the destination buffer. These functions allow you to specify the maximum number of characters to copy, so they can prevent buffer overflows.

Additionally, you should also check the return value of the `strcpy` function to ensure that it did not overflow the buffer. If the return value is greater than the size of the destination buffer, it means that the buffer overflowed, and you should handle the error accordingly.",2271,278,11.418150663375854
