177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The function uses a hardcoded list of GUIDs to check for the presence of specific userAccountControl bits, but it does not properly check for the presence of the required rights to set these bits. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended access restrictions and create machine accounts with the desired userAccountControl bits set.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC. The attacker can then use the hardcoded list of GUIDs to set the desired userAccountControl bits on a machine account, even if the attacker does not have the required rights to do so. This can lead to a bypass of intended access restrictions and potentially allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the domain.",3065,291,11.580549478530884

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `fz_try` macro, which catches all exceptions and rethrows them as `FZ_ERROR_TRYLATER`. However, the `fz_rethrow_if` function is used to check if the exception is `FZ_ERROR_TRYLATER`, and if so, it ignores the error and continues execution. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by repeatedly triggering the `FZ_ERROR_TRYLATER` error.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted PDF file to the application, which would cause the `fz_rethrow_if` function to repeatedly ignore the `FZ_ERROR_TRYLATER` error. This would cause the application to continue executing the code in the `fz_try` block, potentially leading to a crash or other security issue.
