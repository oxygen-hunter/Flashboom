The vulnerability arises from the use of the `pdf_run_xobject` function, which can execute arbitrary code. The `pdf_run_xobject` function takes a `softmask` parameter, which is a pointer to a `pdf_xobject` structure. If the `softmask` parameter is not NULL, the function will execute the `pdf_run_xobject` function recursively, potentially leading to a stack overflow and an execution of arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `pdf_run_xobject` function does not properly check the `softmask` parameter before using it. The function assumes that the `softmask` parameter is a valid pointer, and it does not check whether the pointer is NULL or not. This allows an attacker to pass a NULL pointer as the `softmask` parameter, which will cause the function to execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to craft a specially crafted PDF file that contains a malicious `pdf_xobject` structure with a NULL pointer as the `softmask` parameter. When the `pdf_run_",2159,301,11.080886602401733

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `datum_to_json` function does not properly handle the `JSONTYPE_JSON` case, where the output is not escaped. This allows an attacker to inject a malicious JSON payload that can cause a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
outputstr = OidOutputFunctionCall(outfuncoid, val);
```
The `OidOutputFunctionCall` function is used to call the output function for a given OID. In this case, the OID is for the `json` type, which is not properly handled. The output function for this type is `json_out`, which is responsible for escaping the output. However, the `datum_to_json` function does not call this function, and instead uses the `OidOutputFunctionCall` function to call the output function directly. This allows an attacker to inject a malicious JSON payload that can cause a buffer overflow.

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `distinctSequences` function, which takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of distinct sequences of length `n` that can be formed using the digits 1 through 6. The function uses a dynamic programming approach, where it stores the results of previous computations in a 2D array `dp`. The vulnerability is that the `dp` array is not properly initialized, which allows an attacker to cause a buffer overflow by providing a large value of `n`. The attacker can then cause the `distinctSequences` function to write to memory outside the bounds of the `dp` array, leading to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.",2121,203,7.63768196105957

177922,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow. The function `add_param_to_argv` is not responsible for executing any code, it only manipulates strings and does not have any potential for buffer overflows.",2303,51,2.360255718231201
177923,Bypass,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability. The code checks the input parameters for null or empty values, and it also checks if the file exists before moving it. Additionally, it checks if the new path is within the open_basedir, if it is set.

The code also uses the php_check_open_basedir function to check if the new path is within the open_basedir, if it is set. This function checks if the new path is within the open_basedir, and if it is not, it returns false.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability.",1905,141,5.2939772605896
177926,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code is a function that takes a base64-encoded image data as input and converts it to a GstBuffer. It uses the g_base64_decode_step function to decode the base64 data, which is a safe function to use. The function also checks the length of the decoded data and returns an error if it is 0.

Therefore, the code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to Exec Code Overflow.",1878,112,4.536905765533447
177927,nan,"  NO, the code is not vulnerable to a nan vulnerability. The code is a C++ function that implements the OpenSSL sealing algorithm for encrypting data using public keys. It does not contain any nan vulnerabilities.",4037,48,2.4802355766296387
