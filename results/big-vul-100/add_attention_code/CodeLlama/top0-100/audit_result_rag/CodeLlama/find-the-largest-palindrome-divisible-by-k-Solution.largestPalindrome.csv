177904,DoS,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a DoS attack. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `Splash::blitMask` function, which can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) attack. The function takes a `SplashBitmap` object as an argument, which can be used to manipulate the memory of the application. By carefully crafting the `SplashBitmap` object, an attacker can cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly, leading to a DoS attack.",2441,115,4.743514060974121
177905,DoS,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a DoS attack.

177906,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point value as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that value. However, the function does not perform any bounds checking on the input value, which means that an attacker can potentially pass a very large floating-point value to the function, causing the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

For example, an attacker could pass a value of 1.0e300 to the `splashFloor` function, which would cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input to the `makeDashedPath` function, which could lead to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.",3508,240,10.17629075050354
177907,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The code does not contain any buffer overflow vulnerabilities, as it properly checks the size of the input data and does not allow the user to overflow the buffer. Additionally, the code does not contain any use-after-free errors, as it properly frees the memory allocated for the buffer.

Furthermore, the code does not contain any memory leaks, as it properly frees the memory allocated for the buffer.

The code also does not contain any integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities, as it properly checks the size of the input data and does not allow the user to overflow the buffer.

Finally, the code does not contain any null pointer dereference vulnerabilities, as it properly checks the pointer for null before dereferencing it.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.",2240,208,8.083324909210205
177909,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `powmod` function, which calculates the result of `a^b % mod` using a loop. The loop can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) and possibly execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is triggered when the `a` and `b` values are chosen carefully, resulting in a large value of `a^b` that causes an integer overflow. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other memory corruption, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is not related to the `scaleMaskYdXu` function itself, but rather to the `powmod` function, which is used in other parts of the code.",2244,212,8.205874681472778

It returns a string that is a palindrome of length `n` and consists of the digit `k` repeated `n/2` times. The function does not have any input validation, and it does not use any external resources that could be exploited to cause a DoS attack. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to a DoS attack.",1812,117,4.739463806152344
177911,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec_Code_Overflow.

The code checks the length of the input table and the number of glyph indices in the table. It also checks if the glyph indices are within the valid range. The code does not appear to have any potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

However, the code does have some potential issues related to memory management and error handling. For example, it does not check if the input table is null or if the validator is null. It also does not check if the input table is properly aligned or if the validator is properly initialized. Additionally, it does not handle errors properly, such as if the input table is too short or if the glyph indices are out of range.

Overall, while the code does not appear to have any obvious buffer overflow vulnerabilities, it does have some potential issues related to memory management and error handling that should be addressed.",1706,196,7.863597869873047
177912,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code is a function that takes two parameters, `table` and `valid`, and performs some validation on the input data. It does not appear to contain any code that could be used to execute arbitrary code.

However, the code does contain some potential vulnerabilities related to buffer overflows and improper input validation. For example, the function uses the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro to read data from the `table` buffer, which could potentially lead to buffer overflows if the input data is not properly validated. Additionally, the function does not properly validate the `start_id` and `end` values, which could lead to out-of-bounds accesses or other vulnerabilities if the input data is not properly sanitized.",1954,175,7.108462572097778
177913,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro, which reads a 32-bit integer from a buffer and advances the buffer pointer by 4 bytes. However, the macro does not perform any bounds checking on the buffer pointer, which can lead to an overflow if the buffer pointer exceeds the valid memory region.

For example, if the `table` pointer points to a buffer with a size of 16 bytes, and the `length` variable is set to 8192, the `p` pointer will be advanced by 8192 bytes, which is beyond the valid memory region. This can lead to a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro should be modified to perform bounds checking on the buffer pointer before advancing it. Additionally, the code should be audited for other potential vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, memory leaks, integer overflows, null pointer dereferences, improper input validation, race conditions, insecure function usage, insecure resource management, and improper error",2992,301,12.047663688659668
177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code contains a potential Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `largestPalindrome` function, which has a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the `string` class. The `string` class is not bounds-checked, and the function does not properly validate the input `n` and `k` values. This can lead to an integer overflow and a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is in the `f` function, which is called by the `largestPalindrome` function. The `f` function has a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the `string` class. The function does not properly validate the input `l` value, which can lead to an integer overflow and a buffer overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, the `largestPalindrome` function should properly validate the input `n` and `k` values, and the `f` function should properly validate the input `l` value. Additionally, the `string` class should be replaced with a bounds-checked string class, such as `std::string` or `std::basic_string`.",2542,260,10.644559860229492

177922,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to Exec_Code_Overflow. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strcpy` function, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the destination buffer is not large enough to hold the source string. The `strcpy` function does not perform any bounds checking, so it is possible to write beyond the end of the destination buffer, leading to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input to the `add_param_to_argv` function, which can cause the buffer to overflow and write beyond the end of the destination buffer. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control of the system or steal sensitive information.

To fix the vulnerability, it is recommended to use safer functions like `strncpy` or `strlcpy` that perform bounds checking and prevent buffer overflows. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the source string, and to properly validate user input to prevent buffer overflows.",2724,236,9.575815439224243
177923,Bypass,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability. The code checks the input parameters for null or empty values, and it also checks if the file exists before moving it. Additionally, it checks if the new path is within the open_basedir, if it is set.

The code also uses the php_check_open_basedir function to check if the new path is within the open_basedir, if it is set. This function checks if the new path is within the open_basedir, and if it is not, it returns false.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability.",2326,141,5.683700323104858
177926,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code is using the `g_base64_decode_step` function to decode a base64-encoded string, which is a safe function to use. The function takes a pointer to the base64-encoded data, the length of the data, a pointer to the decoded data, and two other parameters that are not used in this code. The function returns the length of the decoded data, which is then used to create a new `GstBuffer` object.

There is no evidence of any buffer overflow vulnerability in this code. The `g_base64_decode_step` function is designed to handle base64-encoded data of any length, and it does not have any known vulnerabilities.

Therefore, I conclude that the code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.",2299,190,7.617086887359619
