The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `minStartingIndex` function, which is a naive implementation of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for finding the first occurrence of a pattern in a text. The function uses a static variable to store the z-function, which is an array of size O(n) that contains the number of times a character appears in the pattern. The function then uses this array to find the first occurrence of the pattern in the text.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `minStartingIndex` function does not properly initialize the z-function array. Specifically, the function does not set the z-function array to zero for the first n characters of the pattern, which means that the z-function array contains garbage values for these characters. This garbage values can cause the function to return incorrect results, leading to a nan vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `minStartingIndex` function, which is a naive implementation of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for finding the first occurrence of a pattern in a text. The function uses a static variable `z` to store the Z-function of the pattern, which is computed once and then reused for all subsequent calls. However, the function does not properly reset the `z` array when the pattern changes, which allows an attacker to exploit the vulnerability by repeatedly calling the function with different patterns.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `z_function` function is called twice, once with the pattern and once with the reversed pattern.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashDist` function, which calculates the distance between two points. The function uses the `sqrt` function to calculate the distance, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input values are large enough. The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input that causes the `splashDist` function to overflow the buffer.

The vulnerability can be mitigated by using a safer function to calculate the distance, such as the `hypot` function, which is available in C++11 and later. Alternatively, the `sqrt` function can be replaced with a safer function, such as the `sqrtl` function, which is available in C++11 and later.",3006,218,8.854376554489136

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `minStartingIndex` function, which takes a string `s` and a pattern `pattern` as input. The function uses the Z-function to find the minimum starting index of the pattern in the string. However, the function does not properly handle the case where the pattern is a substring of the string, and the Z-function returns a value that is greater than the length of the pattern. This can cause the function to return an incorrect index, leading to an overflow in the `s` string.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can provide a crafted string `s` that is a substring of the pattern, and a pattern that is longer than the length of the substring. The function will then return an incorrect index, leading to an overflow in the `s` string. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application.",2040,245,9.03930926322937

177918,Exec Code,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `minStartingIndex` takes two string arguments, `s` and `pattern`, and returns the index of the first occurrence of `pattern` in `s`. The function uses the Z-function to find the longest common prefix of `pattern` and `s`, and then checks if the length of the Z-function plus a constant `K` is greater than or equal to the length of `pattern`. If this condition is true, the function returns the index of the first occurrence of `pattern` in `s`.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function `minStartingIndex` does not properly check the length of the Z-function. If the length of the Z-function is greater than or equal to the length of `pattern`, the function returns the index of the first occurrence of `pattern` in `s`, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the index is greater than or equal to the length of `s`.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a string `s` with a large length and a small `pattern` string. The Z-function for `pattern` and `s` will have a large length, and the function `minStartingIndex` will return a large index, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the index is greater than or equal to the length of `s`.",1797,301,11.459233045578003

The function `minStartingIndex` takes two string arguments, `s` and `pattern`, and returns the index of the first character in `s` that is equal to the first character of `pattern`. However, the function does not check the size of the input strings before accessing their characters, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input strings are too large.

For example, if `s` is a very large string and `pattern` is a small string, the function will try to access characters beyond the end of `s` in the line `if (z1[size(pattern) + i] + K + z2[size(s) - i] >= size(pattern)) {`. This can cause the function to read uninitialized memory, leading to an unpredictable crash or other security vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, the function should check the size of the input strings before accessing their characters. This can be done by using the `size` function to check the length of the strings before accessing their characters. For example:
```
if (size(s) >= size(pattern) && z1[size(pattern) + i] + K + z2[size(s) - i] >= size(pattern)) {

177922,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2019-11360. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `strcpy` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the destination buffer is not large enough to hold the source string. In this case, the `strcpy` function is used to copy the `param_buffer` string into the `param_buffer` array, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the `param_buffer` string is too large.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft an input string that is larger than the `param_buffer` array, causing the `strcpy` function to overwrite the return address on the stack with a pointer to a shellcode. When the `add_argv` function is called, it will execute the shellcode, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

177927,nan,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The function `minStartingIndex` has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the `strncpy` function. The `strncpy` function copies the first `n` characters of the source string to the destination string, where `n` is the length of the source string. If the destination string is not large enough to hold the entire source string, it can cause a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strncpy` function in the `minStartingIndex` function. The function takes two string arguments, `s` and `pattern`, and returns the index of the first character in `s` that is equal to the first character of `pattern`. However, the function does not check if the destination string is large enough to hold the entire source string, which can cause a buffer overflow.

For example, if the `s` string is ""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"" and the `pattern` string is ""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890"", the `minStartingIndex` function will return the index of the first character in `s` that is equal to the first character of `pattern`, which is 0.
