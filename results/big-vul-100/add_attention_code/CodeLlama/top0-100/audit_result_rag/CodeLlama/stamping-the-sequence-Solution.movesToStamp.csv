The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The function uses a hardcoded list of GUIDs to check for specific user account control flags, but it does not properly check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended access restrictions and create machine accounts with the desired user account control flags.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC. The attacker can then use the hardcoded GUIDs to create machine accounts with the desired user account control flags, which can lead to unauthorized access or escalation of privileges.",2656,257,9.601435422897339

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the number of bytes read. This means that if the image data is corrupted or malicious, it can cause the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the stream, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an exploitable code execution vulnerability.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted PDF file that contains a malicious image with a large number of pixels. The malicious image can be crafted to cause the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the stream, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an exploitable code execution vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, the `ImageStream` class should be modified to perform bounds checking on the number of bytes read from the stream.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `cairo_matrix_init_translate` function, which takes a `double` argument for the translation value. However, the value is not properly validated, and an attacker can potentially provide a large value that causes a buffer overflow. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `cairo_matrix_init_translate` function does not check the validity of the `tx` and `ty` arguments, which are used to set the translation values. An attacker can potentially provide a large value for these arguments, which can cause the `cairo_matrix_init_translate` function to write beyond the bounds of the allocated memory, leading to a buffer overflow.

The pattern is created from the `maskImage` surface, which is created from the `maskBuffer` buffer. The `maskBuffer` buffer is created by copying the `maskStr` stream into it, and the `maskStr` stream is read until the end.

Vulnerability summary:
vfs.c in smbd in Samba 3.x and 4.x before 4.1.22, 4.2.x before 4.2.7, and 4.3.x before 4.3.3, when share names with certain substring relationships exist, allows remote attackers to bypass intended file-access restrictions via a symlink that points outside of a share.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the SMB_VFS_REALPATH function, which returns the absolute path of a file. The code checks if the absolute path of the parent directory is the same as the stat value of the parent directory. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent bypassing the intended file-access restrictions. An attacker can create a symlink that points outside of a share, and then use the symlink to access the file.

The `imgCoordMungeLowerC` function takes a `SplashCoord` as input and returns a `int` value. The `imgCoordMungeUpperC` function takes a `SplashCoord` as input and returns a `int` value. Both functions are used to manipulate the coordinates of a matrix, but they do not perform any bounds checking on the input data.

The vulnerability arises when an attacker provides a malicious input to the `imgCoordMungeLowerC` or `imgCoordMungeUpperC` function. The input data is not properly validated, which allows an attacker to overflow the buffer and cause a denial of service.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can provide a malicious input to the `imgCoordMungeLowerC` or `imgCoordMungeUpperC` function, which can cause a buffer overflow. The attacker can then use the overflow to execute arbitrary code, leading to a denial of service.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern to use. The function takes a floating-point value as input and returns an integer value. However, the function does not perform any bounds checking on the input value, which means that an attacker can potentially pass a large floating-point value that will cause an integer overflow and lead to a crash.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted input string to the `makeDashedPath` function that contains a large floating-point value that will cause an integer overflow. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, as the application will crash and become unavailable to users.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `add_param_to_argv` function does not properly check the size of the `param_buffer` array before copying data into it. This allows an attacker to overflow the buffer and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is related to the `add_argv` function, which is called after the `param_buffer` array has been filled with data. The `add_argv` function does not properly check the size of the `param_buffer` array before copying data into it, which allows an attacker to overflow the buffer and potentially execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a specially crafted input that causes the `param_buffer` array to overflow. This can be done by providing a long string of characters that is longer than the size of the `param_buffer` array. Once the buffer has been overflowed, the attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code.
