Specifically, the `for` loop in the `default` case of the `switch` statement has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `inp` pointer is incremented by `nComps` each time, which can cause the pointer to wrap around and access memory outside the allocated buffer. This can lead to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

Additionally, the code does not properly check the return value of the `pipeInit` function, which could potentially lead to a crash or other security issue if the function fails.

Overall, while the code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities, it is important to carefully review the code and ensure that all potential security issues are properly addressed.",1790,220,8.097536563873291
177905,DoS,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS attack. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `imgCoordMungeLowerC` and `imgCoordMungeUpperC` functions, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input data is not properly validated. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted input that causes the buffer to overflow, leading to a crash or denial of service.

The vulnerability is related to the CWE-20 input validation issue, which is a common vulnerability in software. The `imgCoordMungeLowerC` and `imgCoordMungeUpperC` functions are used to validate the input data, but they do not properly check for buffer overflows. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted input that causes the buffer to overflow, leading to a crash or denial of service.

The vulnerability is not related to any other CWE-ID, such as CWE-120, CWE-121, CWE-416, CWE-401, CWE-190, CWE-191, CWE-404, CWE-732, CWE-248, or CWE-327.",3372,287,10.973116874694824
177906,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input value is too large.

If the input value is too large, the function will return a value that is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input value, but rather a value that is too large to be represented by the integer type. This can cause the loop to run indefinitely, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted input that causes the `splashFloor` function to return a value that is too large, leading to an infinite loop. This can cause the application to crash or become unresponsive, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that the `splashFloor` function is",2857,301,11.405193090438843

177911,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code checks the length of the input buffer and the number of glyph indices in the table, and it also checks that the glyph indices are valid. It does not appear to have any vulnerabilities related to integer overflow or underflow.

However, the code does have a potential buffer overflow vulnerability if the input buffer is too large. If the input buffer is larger than the maximum allowed length, the code will read beyond the end of the buffer and potentially overwrite other memory locations. This could potentially lead to a crash or other security issue.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the length of the input buffer and the number of glyph indices in the table, and it should ensure that the input buffer is not too large. It should also ensure that the glyph indices are valid and not too large.",1055,188,6.76813268661499

The code checks the length of the input buffer and ensures that it is not too short. It also checks that the input buffer is not too long. The code does not appear to contain any integer overflows that could lead to an exploitable condition.

However, the code does contain a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `minimumLevel` function. The function uses a recursive approach to traverse the tree and computes the minimum level of the tree. However, the function does not check the size of the input buffer before traversing it, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the input buffer is too large.

To fix this vulnerability, the function should check the size of the input buffer before traversing it. Additionally, the function should return an error if the input buffer is too large.",1303,184,6.771829843521118

177922,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strcpy` function, which can copy more characters than the destination buffer can hold. This can lead to an overflow, which can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the `strcpy` function, which can copy more characters than the destination buffer can hold. This can lead to an overflow, which can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

The code is vulnerable because it does not check the size of the destination buffer before copying data into it. This means that the `strcpy` function can copy more characters than the buffer can hold, leading to an overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the size of the destination buffer before copying data into it. This can be done by using the `strlen` function to determine the size of the destination buffer, and then using the `strncpy` function to copy data into the buffer, making sure to only copy the number of characters that fit in the buffer.

Additionally, the code should also check for null pointers before dereferencing them, as this can also lead to a buffer overflow.

It is also recommended to use safer functions like `strncpy` and `strlcpy` instead of `strcpy` to avoid buffer overflows.",2073,298,11.084262371063232
177923,Bypass,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability.
