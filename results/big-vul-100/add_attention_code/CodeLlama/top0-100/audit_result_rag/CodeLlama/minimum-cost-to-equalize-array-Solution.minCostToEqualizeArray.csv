The function then checks if the number of elements in the array is less than or equal to 2. If it is, the function returns the total number of cost1 operations required to equalize the array.

177919,nan,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `XListFonts` takes a pattern as input, which is then used to construct a request to the X server. The request is then sent to the server, and the server responds with a list of fonts that match the pattern. The code then unpacks the response from the server into a list of null-terminated strings.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `XListFonts` function does not properly validate the length of the response from the server. If the server responds with a malicious pattern that is longer than the maximum allowed length, the code will attempt to read beyond the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. This can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

The CVE-ID for this vulnerability is CVE-2018-14599, and the CWE-ID is CWE-682.",2496,212,8.028364896774292

177922,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2019-11360. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `add_param_to_argv` function does not properly check the size of the `param_buffer` array before copying data into it. This allows an attacker to overflow the buffer and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
param_buffer[param_len++] = *curchar;
```
This line of code copies the character pointed to by `curchar` into the `param_buffer` array, but it does not check if the buffer is full before doing so. If the buffer is full, this line of code will overwrite the next character in the buffer, potentially leading to an overflow.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a specially crafted input that causes the `param_buffer` array to overflow. This can be done by providing a long string of characters that is longer than the size of the `param_buffer` array. Once the buffer overflows, the attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code.

It is important to note that this vulnerability is not related to the `minCostTo",2376,301,11.50860595703125
177923,Bypass,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability. The code checks the input parameters for null or empty values, and it also checks if the file exists before moving it. Additionally, it checks if the new path is within the open_basedir, if it is set.

The code also uses the php_check_open_basedir function to check if the new path is within the open_basedir, if it is set. This function checks if the new path is within the open_basedir, and if it is not, it returns false.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability.",1978,141,5.7885801792144775
177926,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code is a function that takes in a vector of integers and two integers representing the cost of performing a cost1 operation and a cost2 operation. The function then calculates the minimum cost to equalize the array by performing cost1 operations on the elements of the array until the maximum element is reached, and then performing cost2 operations on the remaining elements.

The function does not appear to have any vulnerabilities related to Exec Code Overflow, as it does not involve any user input or external data. The only potential vulnerability could be if the function is used in a way that allows an attacker to manipulate the input vector or the cost1 and cost2 parameters, but this would not result in an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability.",1951,167,6.670492172241211
