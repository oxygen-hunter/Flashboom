The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are necessary to create machine accounts. This allows an attacker to create machine accounts with the desired access rights, bypassing the intended access restrictions.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, and who can create machine accounts with the desired access rights. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or system resources.",2663,240,9.144967794418335

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code allows a symlink to point outside of a share, which can bypass intended file-access restrictions. This can be exploited by creating a symlink to a directory outside of the share, and then using it to access files that are not intended to be accessed.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to create symlinks on the system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have write access to the share directory, and then create a symlink to a directory outside of the share.
