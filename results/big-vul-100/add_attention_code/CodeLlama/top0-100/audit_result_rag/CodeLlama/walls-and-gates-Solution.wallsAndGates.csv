The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream and returns it as a `SplashColorPtr`. The `SplashColorPtr` is a pointer to an array of `SplashColor` objects, which are used to represent the color of each pixel in the image.

The vulnerability occurs when the `getLine` method is called with a large value of `n`, which causes the `ImageStream` class to allocate a large amount of memory for the `SplashColorPtr` array. If the attacker can control the value of `n`, they can potentially cause a buffer overflow by providing a large value that exceeds the available memory. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, potentially allowing the attacker to gain control of the system or steal sensitive data.

The `ImageStream` class has a buffer size of 4096 bytes, which can be overflowed by a crafted PDF file.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.",2430,134,5.190294504165649
177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow. The code is a function that loads a CFF charset into memory, and it does not contain any code that could potentially lead to an overflow. The function uses FT_STREAM_SEEK and FT_READ_BYTE to read data from a stream, and it does not contain any code that could potentially lead to an overflow. Additionally, the function does not contain any code that could potentially lead to an underflow. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.",1980,118,4.570408344268799

177922,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow. The code is a parser for the iptables-restore command, and it is not intended to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability you mentioned is a buffer overflow in the iptables-restore command, which is a different issue.",2162,66,2.8342044353485107
177923,Bypass,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability. The code checks the input parameters for null or empty values before using them, and it also checks the return value of the `zend_hash_exists` function to determine if the file exists in the hash table. Additionally, the code uses the `php_check_open_basedir` function to check if the new path is within the open_basedir, and it uses the `VCWD_RENAME` function to rename the file.

Therefore, the code does not have any obvious vulnerabilities related to bypassing security checks. However, it is still possible that there may be other vulnerabilities or security issues in the code that have not been identified.",1764,158,5.917845010757446
177926,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code is a function that takes a vector of vectors of integers as input and modifies it in place. It does not appear to have any vulnerabilities related to Exec Code Overflow.

However, the code does have some potential issues related to buffer overflow, use after free, and other security vulnerabilities. For example, the function uses a queue to store the coordinates of the cells to be processed, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the queue grows too large. Additionally, the function uses a pair of integers to represent the coordinates of the cells, which could lead to a use after free vulnerability if the pair is used after the memory it points to has been deallocated.

Overall, while the code does not appear to have any Exec Code Overflow vulnerabilities, it does have some potential security vulnerabilities that should be addressed.",1737,190,7.1385157108306885
177927,nan,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to any of the security vulnerabilities listed in the previous steps.

The code is a C++ function that implements the OpenSSL PEM sealing algorithm. It takes in a data string, a public key array, and an optional IV parameter, and returns the sealed data. The function does not contain any of the vulnerabilities listed in the previous steps.

The code does not contain any buffer overflow vulnerabilities, as it does not involve any string or memory functions that could lead to buffer overflows.

The code does not contain any use-after-free errors, as it does not involve any pointers that are used after the memory they point to has been deallocated.

The code does not contain any memory leaks, as it properly frees the memory allocated for the EVP_PKEY and EVP_CIPHER_CTX structures using EVP_PKEY_free and EVP_CIPHER_CTX_free.

The code does not contain any integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities, as it does not involve any arithmetic operations that could lead to integer overflows or underflows.

The code does not contain any null pointer dereferences, as it properly checks for null pointers before dereferencing them.

The code does not contain any improper input validation vulnerabilities, as it properly validates the input parameters and sanitizes the",3896,301,11.806271076202393
