177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are necessary to set the UF_SERVER_TRUST_ACCOUNT and UF_PARTIAL_SECRETS_ACCOUNT bits in the userAccountControl attribute. This allows an attacker to create a machine account with these bits set, even if they do not have the necessary rights.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC. The attacker can then use the created machine account to bypass intended access restrictions, such as access control lists (ACLs) or file permissions. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or system resources.",2671,290,11.528620719909668

If the `softmask` parameter is not properly validated, an attacker can pass a malicious value that points to a memory location that contains malicious code. When the `pdf_run_xobject` function is called, it will execute the malicious code, potentially leading to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted PDF file to the `begin_softmask` function, which will cause the code to execute the malicious code. The attacker can use a variety of techniques to exploit this vulnerability, such as sending a specially crafted PDF file that contains a malicious `pdf_xobject` structure, or using a specially crafted input to the `pdf_run_xobject` function that points to a malicious memory location.

177905,DoS,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS attack. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `imgCoordMungeLowerC` and `imgCoordMungeUpperC` functions, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input data is not properly validated.

The `imgCoordMungeLowerC` function takes a `SplashCoord` as input and returns a `int` value. The `imgCoordMungeUpperC` function takes a `SplashCoord` as input and returns a `int` value. Both functions are used to calculate the minimum and maximum values of a coordinate, respectively.

The vulnerability arises when an attacker provides a malicious input to these functions, causing a buffer overflow. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a large input value that exceeds the size of the buffer used to store the coordinate values. This can cause the program to write beyond the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input to the `imgCoordMungeLowerC` or `imgCoordMungeUpperC` function, causing the program to write beyond the end of the buffer and overwrite other memory locations. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, memory corruption, or other security vulnerabilities.

177906,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input value is too large.

If the input value is too large, the function will return a value that is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input value, but rather a value that is too large to be stored in an integer variable. This can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

For example, if the input value is 1.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",3189,301,11.458720922470093

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` and `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macros, which are used to read data from the input stream. However, these macros do not perform any bounds checking on the input data, which can lead to buffer overflows if the input data is malicious.

In the given code, the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` macro is used to read a large amount of data from the input stream, which can potentially overflow the buffer allocated for the data. Similarly, the `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macro is used to read more data from the input stream, which can also potentially overflow the buffer.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a malicious input that contains a large amount of data, which can overflow the buffer and cause the program to execute arbitrary code. This can lead to code execution vulnerabilities, which can be used to gain unauthorized access to the system or steal sensitive data.
