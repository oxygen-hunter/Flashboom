177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The function uses a hardcoded list of GUIDs to check for specific user account control flags, but it does not properly check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended access restrictions and create machine accounts with the desired user account control flags.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted request to the function, which would allow an attacker to create machine accounts with the desired user account control flags.

The `estrdup` function is a wrapper around the `malloc` function, which allocates memory from the heap. The `estrdup` function also copies the contents of the `timestr->data` pointer to the newly allocated memory.

The `mktime` function is then called with the `thetime` structure as an argument, which is used to store the time information. The `mktime` function returns the number of seconds since the Epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC) that corresponds to the given time.

The `gmadjust` variable is then set to the value of `thetime.tm_gmtoff`, which is the number of seconds that the time is ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The `gmadjust` variable is then added to the return value of `mktime`, which gives the number of seconds since the Epoch that corresponds to the given time in the local time zone.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the number of bytes read. This means that if the image data is corrupted or malicious, the `getLine` method can read more bytes than the image data actually contains, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a malicious image that contains a large number of pixels, causing the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the image data and overflow the buffer. This can be done by sending a specially crafted PDF file that contains a malicious image with a large number of pixels, or by using a specially crafted image file that is not a valid image file.

177910,DoS,  NO. The code is not vulnerable to a DoS attack. The function `token_continue` is not vulnerable to a DoS attack because it does not handle user input or read from the file system. It only handles the scanner state and does not have any user input or file system access.,1096,65,2.544722080230713
177911,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code checks the length of the table and the number of glyphs in the table, and it also checks that the glyph indices are valid. It does not appear to be vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

However, the code does have other vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows and use-after-free errors, which could potentially be exploited by an attacker.",990,98,3.828444004058838
177912,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code is a function that takes two vectors as input and returns a string based on the contents of the vectors. It does not involve any user input or external data, so there is no potential for buffer overflow or other security vulnerabilities.

The only potential issue with the code is that it uses a hard-coded lookup table to determine the best hand based on the contents of the vectors. This could potentially lead to a security vulnerability if the lookup table is modified or tampered with, but this is not a concern in this case.",1238,128,5.384361267089844
177913,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code checks the length of the input buffer and ensures that it is not too short. It also checks that the input is properly aligned and that the `is32` array is properly initialized.

There is no evidence of integer overflows or other vulnerabilities in the code. The code appears to be well-written and secure.",2276,88,3.931872606277466
177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code is using the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` and `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macros to read data from the stream, which ensures that the data is read in a controlled manner and does not overflow the buffer. Additionally, the code is using the `FT_READ_USHORT` and `FT_READ_BYTE` functions to read data from the stream, which also ensures that the data is read in a controlled manner and does not overflow the buffer.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.",1826,140,5.448783874511719
177917,Exec Code,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec_Code. The code is a function that retrieves a list of font paths from the X server and returns it as a null-terminated string array. It does not contain any code that could be used to execute arbitrary code on the system.",1539,63,2.5544776916503906
177918,Exec Code,  NO. The code is not vulnerable to Exec_Code.,1583,15,0.8758606910705566
177919,nan,  NO. The code is not vulnerable to a nan vulnerability. The function bestHand is not related to the vulnerability in XListFonts.,2128,33,1.5671870708465576
177920,nan,  NO. The code is not vulnerable to a nan vulnerability.,1528,16,0.8961324691772461
177921,nan,  NO. The code is not vulnerable to a nan vulnerability.,1604,16,0.9731931686401367
177922,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code does not contain any buffer overflow vulnerabilities, as it properly checks the length of the input string and does not allow the input to exceed the size of the buffer. Additionally, the code does not use any unsafe functions such as strcpy or sprintf, which are commonly used in buffer overflow attacks.

However, the code does contain a potential security vulnerability in the handling of user input. The code does not properly validate user input, which can lead to buffer overflows or other security vulnerabilities if the user enters invalid or malicious input. To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly validate user input and sanitize it before using it in any calculations or operations.",2008,158,6.4069437980651855
177923,Bypass,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The code checks the input parameters for null or empty values before using them, and it also checks the input parameters for proper length before using them. Additionally, the code uses the `zend_parse_parameters` function to parse the input parameters, which checks for null or empty values and ensures that the input parameters are of the correct type.

Therefore, the code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to Bypass.",1610,108,4.149511337280273
177926,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code is a function that takes two vectors as input, `ranks` and `suits`, and returns a string based on the contents of the vectors. The function does not appear to have any buffer overflow vulnerabilities, and it does not appear to be using any unsafe functions or libraries.

Therefore, I would not classify this code as vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.",1583,98,4.003812074661255
177927,nan,  NO. The code is not vulnerable to a nan vulnerability.,3742,16,1.277308464050293
