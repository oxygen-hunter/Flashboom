The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are necessary to create machine accounts. This allows an attacker to create a machine account with the desired UAC bits set, even if they do not have the necessary rights.

The `estrdup` function is a wrapper around the `malloc` function, which allocates memory from the heap. The memory allocated by `estrdup` is not freed until the `strbuf` variable goes out of scope, which is when the function returns.

Therefore, there is no memory leak in the code.

Additionally, the code is not using any deprecated or insecure functions, such as `strcpy`, `gets`, or `scanf`. It is using the `snprintf` function to format the time string, which is a safer alternative to `sprintf`.

The code is also not using any improper error handling mechanisms, such as ignoring or mishandling exceptions or errors. It is using the `php_error_docref` function to log errors, which is a safer alternative to `printf`.

177904,DoS,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a DoS attack. The code is using the `powmod` function to calculate the power of a number, and the result is being compared to the target value. The `powmod` function is not vulnerable to a DoS attack because it is not possible to cause a buffer overflow or other type of vulnerability by passing a large value as the `b` parameter.

However, it is possible to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by passing a large value as the `mod` parameter, which could cause the `powmod` function to take a long time to execute. This is because the `powmod` function uses a loop to calculate the power of the number, and the loop could run for a long time if the `mod` parameter is large.

To prevent this type of attack, it is recommended to use a bounded loop to calculate the power of the number, and to limit the maximum value of the `mod` parameter. This can be done by using a modulo operation to ensure that the `mod` parameter is less than a certain value, and by using a bounded loop to ensure that the loop runs for a certain number of iterations.",2045,259,9.548476934432983
177905,DoS,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS attack. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `powmod` function, which can be used to calculate the modular exponentiation of a large number, leading to a slowdown in the execution of the code. This can cause the application to become unresponsive or crash, leading to a denial-of-service attack.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `powmod` function is not properly bounded, and can take a long time to execute for large inputs. This can lead to a slowdown in the execution of the code, which can cause the application to become unresponsive or crash.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a large number as the input to the `powmod` function, causing the code to execute slowly and potentially leading to a denial-of-service attack.

The CVE-ID for this vulnerability is CVE-2013-1789, and the CWE-ID is CWE-754, which is related to the use of unbounded or unchecked integer calculations.",3627,246,9.363829612731934
177906,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashDist` function, which calculates the distance between two points. The function uses the `pow` function to calculate the distance, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input values are large enough.

The `pow` function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack because it uses a recursive algorithm to calculate the power of a number. If the input values are large enough, the recursive calls can cause a stack overflow, leading to a buffer overflow.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to provide a large input value to the `pow` function, which can cause a stack overflow and a buffer overflow. The attacker can then use the buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.

The fix for this vulnerability is to use a non-recursive algorithm to calculate the power of a number, such as the `powmod` function used in the code. This function uses a modular arithmetic approach to calculate the power of a number, which is less vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.",3112,294,11.325251817703247

177909,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the powmod function, which computes the power of a number modulo a prime number. The function uses a loop to compute the power, and the loop condition is based on the value of the exponent. If the exponent is a large number, the loop may run for a long time, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a large value for the exponent, causing the loop to run for a long time and consume a lot of CPU resources. This can lead to a crash or a slowdown of the application, depending on the system resources available.

To mitigate the vulnerability, the powmod function should be modified to use a more efficient algorithm, such as the binary exponentiation algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(log n) instead of O(n).",1848,243,8.849283933639526

177912,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `powmod` function, which computes the modular power of two integers. The function uses the modular multiplication and modular addition operations, which can result in integer overflows if the inputs are large enough. Specifically, the function uses the modular multiplication operation to compute the result of the power, which can overflow if the result is greater than the modulus. Additionally, the function uses the modular addition operation to compute the result of the power, which can also overflow if the result is greater than the modulus.

The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a large value for the `variables[i][1]` parameter, which is used as the exponent in the `powmod` function. If the exponent is large enough, the result of the power can overflow, leading to an integer overflow vulnerability. This can result in the execution of arbitrary code, potentially leading to a remote code execution vulnerability.

Therefore, it is recommended to fix the vulnerability by using a safe implementation of the `powmod` function that avoids integer overflows.",1558,282,10.229214906692505

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `powmod` function, which computes the modular power of two integers. The function uses the modular multiplication and modular addition operations, which can result in integer overflows if the inputs are large enough.

The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a large value for the `variables[i][1]` parameter, which is used as the exponent in the `powmod` function. If the exponent is large enough, the function can overflow, leading to an exploitable vulnerability.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a specially crafted input that triggers the overflow condition. The attacker can then use the resulting buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application.

However, the code does contain a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `getGoodIndices` function. The function uses the `powmod` function to calculate the result of a modular exponentiation, which can potentially overflow the buffer if the input values are large enough.
