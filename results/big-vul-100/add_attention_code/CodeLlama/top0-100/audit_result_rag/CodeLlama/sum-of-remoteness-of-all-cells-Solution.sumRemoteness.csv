177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The function uses a hardcoded list of GUIDs to check for specific user account control flags, but it does not properly check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended access restrictions and create machine accounts with the desired user account control flags.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC. The attacker can then use the hardcoded GUIDs to create machine accounts with the desired user account control flags, which can bypass intended access restrictions.

The vulnerability can be mitigated by properly checking for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object. This can be done by using the appropriate LDAP filters to check for the presence of the required rights, or by using the appropriate",2650,301,11.707004070281982

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream and returns it as a `SplashColorPtr`. The `SplashColorPtr` is a pointer to an array of `SplashColor` objects, which are used to represent colors in the image.

The vulnerability occurs when the `ImageStream` class is used to read a large image file, and the image file contains a large number of pixels. The `getLine` method reads a line of pixels from the image file and returns it as a `SplashColorPtr`. However, the `SplashColorPtr` is not properly validated, which allows an attacker to craft a specially crafted image file that contains a large number of pixels, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the code. The function `GfxImageColorMap::GfxImageColorMap` takes an integer `bitsA` as input, which is used to determine the maximum value of a pixel. The function then uses this value to calculate the maximum pixel value, which is stored in the variable `maxPixel`.

The function then uses a loop to initialize an array of `GfxColorComp` objects, where each object represents a pixel value. The loop uses the `decodeLow` and `decodeRange` arrays to calculate the pixel values, which can lead to integer overflows if the values are too large.

For example, if `bitsA` is set to a large value, such as 32, the maximum pixel value will be 2^32 - 1, which is a very large number. If the `decodeLow` and `decodeRange` arrays are also set to large values, the pixel values can become very large as well, leading to integer overflows.

This can be exploited by creating a symlink that points to a file outside of the share, and then accessing the symlink. The code does not properly check the validity of the symlink, which allows an attacker to access files outside of the share.

The `editor_program` variable is set to the string ""ed"" which is a text editor program. The `editor_program` variable is then used in the `sprintf` function to create a shell command that is executed by the `execl` function. The `sprintf` function takes in a format string and a variable number of arguments, and returns a string that is the result of formatting the format string with the arguments. The format string in this case is ""%s %s%s"", which is a string that contains the editor program name followed by a space and then the output file name. The output file name is obtained from the `outname` variable, which is a pointer to a character array. The `outname` variable is set to the value of the `outname` parameter passed to the `do_ed_script` function.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `outname` variable is not properly validated before it is used in the `sprintf` function.
