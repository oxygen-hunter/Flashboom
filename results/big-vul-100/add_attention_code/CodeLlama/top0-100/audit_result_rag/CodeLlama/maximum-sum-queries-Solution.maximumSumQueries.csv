177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The function uses a map to check for specific user account control (UAC) bits and their corresponding GUIDs. However, it does not properly check for administrative privileges, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC. The attacker can then use the function to create a machine account with the desired UAC bits, which can bypass intended access restrictions.

The vulnerability can be mitigated by properly checking for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This can be done by adding additional checks to ensure that the user has the necessary privileges to perform the operation.",2524,275,10.131661891937256
177740,DoS Exec Code Overflow Mem. Corr.,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to any of the security vulnerabilities you mentioned.

The code is using the `estrdup` function to allocate memory for the `strbuf` variable, which is a buffer that is used to store the time string. The `estrdup` function is a wrapper around the `malloc` function, which allocates memory from the heap. The memory allocated by `estrdup` is not freed until the `strbuf` variable goes out of scope, which is when the function returns.

Therefore, the memory allocated by `estrdup` is not vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack, as the attacker cannot write more data to the buffer than the allocated size.

Furthermore, the code is using the `mktime` function to convert the time string to a `time_t` value, which is a 32-bit integer. The `mktime` function takes a `struct tm` value as input, which contains the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second. The `struct tm` value is initialized with the values from the time string, and the `mktime` function returns the number of seconds since the Epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC).

The `mktime` function does not have any buffer overflow vulnerabilities",1993,301,11.439327955245972

The code is a function that takes in a session object and returns a pointer to a buffer that contains the serialized session data. The function checks if the session is resumable and if it is, it packs the session data into a buffer. The function then returns the buffer and its size.

The vulnerability you mentioned is related to the use of the `strcpy` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the destination buffer is not large enough to hold the source string. However, the code does not use the `strcpy` function, it uses the `_gnutls_session_pack` function which is a custom function that is used to pack the session data.

Furthermore, the code checks if the buffer is large enough to hold the session data before copying it, so it is not vulnerable to a buffer overflow.

The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to memory management, buffer overflows, or other security issues. However, it does contain a potential race condition in the `pdf_run_xobject` function, which could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability if not properly synchronized.

The `pdf_run_xobject` function calls `pdf_run_xobject` recursively, which could lead to a stack overflow if the recursion is not properly bounded. Additionally, the function uses a `fz_try` block to catch errors, but it does not properly handle the error case. If an error occurs during the execution of the function, the `fz_rethrow_if` function is called, which could lead to a crash or other unpredictable behavior.

To mitigate this potential vulnerability, the function should be modified to properly handle errors and ensure that the recursion is properly bounded.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the number of bytes read. This means that if the image data is corrupted or malicious, it can cause the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the stream, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially executing arbitrary code.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted PDF file that contains a malicious image with a large number of pixels. The malicious image can be crafted to cause the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the stream, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially executing arbitrary code.

To fix the vulnerability, the `ImageStream` class should be modified to perform bounds checking on the number of bytes read.

The `gets` function does not perform any bounds checking, and it does not provide any mechanism for the user to specify the maximum size of the input string. This means that an attacker can potentially overflow the buffer by providing a large input string, leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted PDF file to the application, which would cause the `gets` function to read data from the file into the buffer, potentially overflowing the buffer and leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

It is important to note that this vulnerability is not specific to the `gets` function, but rather a general issue with any function that does not perform bounds checking.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `cairo_matrix_init_translate` function, which takes a `double` argument for the translation value. However, the value is not properly validated, and an attacker can potentially provide a large value that causes a buffer overflow. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `cairo_matrix_init_translate` function does not properly validate the `tx` argument, which is the translation value. An attacker can potentially provide a large value for `tx`, which can cause the `cairo_matrix_init_translate` function to write beyond the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `cairo_mask` function, which takes a `cairo_pattern_t` as an argument. The `cairo_pattern_t` is created from a `cairo_surface_t` using the `cairo_pattern_create_for_surface` function. The `cairo_surface_t` is created from a `buffer` using the `cairo_image_surface_create_for_data` function.

The `cairo_image_surface_create_for_data` function takes a `buffer` as an argument, which is a pointer to a block of memory that contains the image data. The `buffer` is created using the `gmalloc` function, which allocates memory using the `malloc` function.

The `malloc` function allocates memory from the heap, which is a shared resource that can be accessed by multiple threads. If the `malloc` function is used in a way that causes a buffer overflow, it can lead to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

An attacker can provide a specially crafted `data` parameter that causes the function to read beyond the bounds of the allocated memory, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `data` parameter is not properly validated, and the function does not check whether the `data` parameter is a valid pointer or not. Additionally, the function does not check whether the `data` parameter is a valid pointer to a memory block that is large enough to hold the image data.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can provide a specially crafted `data` parameter that points to a memory location that is not allocated by the program.

The code is a C++ function that parses an XML file using the libxml2 library. It does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, or memory leaks.

However, it is important to note that the code is using the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` function, which can be vulnerable to XXE attacks if the XML file being parsed contains an XML external entity declaration. This is because the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` function does not perform any validation on the XML file, and it can be exploited by an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should use the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxtWithData` function instead, which takes an additional `data` parameter that can be used to specify a custom entity loader. This can be used to load the XML file using a custom entity loader that performs validation on the XML file before parsing it.

Additionally, the code should also use the `xmlCreateFileParserCtxt` function with the `options` parameter set to `XML_PARSE_NOENT` to prevent the parser from expanding external entities.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input value is too large.

If the input value is too large, the function will return a value that is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input value, but rather a value that is too large to be stored in an integer variable. This can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

For example, if the input value is 2^31 (which is the largest integer that can be stored in a 32-bit signed integer), the function will return 2^31 - 1, which is a valid integer. However, if the input value is 2^31 + 1, the function will return 2^31, which is not a valid integer and can cause a crash or other security vulnerability.

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` and `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macros, which are used to read and write data to the stream. These macros use the `FT_READ_BYTE` and `FT_READ_USHORT` functions, which can cause an integer overflow if the number of bytes or words to be read exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the type.

For example, if the `num_glyphs` variable is set to a large value, the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` macro will attempt to read `num_glyphs - 1` * 2 bytes from the stream, which can cause an integer overflow if `num_glyphs` is greater than the maximum value that can be represented by a `FT_UInt`. Similarly, the `FT_READ_USHORT` function can also cause an integer overflow if the number of words to be read exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by a `FT_UShort`.
