The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `gnutls_session_get_data` function takes a `size_t` parameter `session_data_size` that is used to determine the size of the buffer allocated for the session data. However, the function does not check if the buffer is large enough to hold the entire session data, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the session data is larger than the buffer.

The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a large session ticket that is larger than the buffer size, causing the function to write beyond the end of the buffer and potentially leading to a buffer overflow. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability, as the application may crash or behave unexpectedly.

To fix this vulnerability, the function should be modified to check if the buffer is large enough to hold the entire session data before writing to it.

The vulnerability is caused by an off-by-one error in the phar_parse_zipfile function in ext/phar/zip.c in PHP before 5.5.30 and 5.6.x before 5.6.14. The vulnerability occurs when the / filename is included in a.zip PHAR archive. This can cause a denial of service (uninitialized pointer dereference and application crash) by causing the application to read uninitialized memory.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the phar_parse_zipfile function does not properly check the length of the filename when it is included in the manifest. This allows an attacker to include the / filename in the manifest, which can cause the application to read uninitialized memory.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to create a specially crafted.zip file that includes the / filename in the manifest. This can be done by creating a.zip file with a specially crafted manifest that includes the / filename. The attacker would then need to trick the application into parsing the.zip file and extracting the manifest.

However, the `fz_rethrow_if` function is used to rethrow the exception only if it is of type `FZ_ERROR_TRYLATER`. This means that if an exception of a different type is caught, it will not be rethrown, and the program will continue executing.

Therefore, an attacker can craft a PDF file that contains a malicious `pdf_xobject` object, which will cause an exception to be thrown when it is processed. The exception will be caught by the `fz_try` macro, but since it is not of type `FZ_ERROR_TRYLATER`, it will not be rethrown.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `datum_to_json` function does not properly handle JSON values that are too large to fit in the available memory. Specifically, the function uses a fixed-size buffer to store the JSON output, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the JSON value is too large. This can cause the server to crash, leading to a denial of service.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to send a specially crafted JSON value that is larger than the fixed-size buffer used by the `datum_to_json` function. This can be done by sending a JSON value that contains a large number of nested arrays or objects, which can cause the buffer to overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, the `splashFloor` function should be modified to check for overflows and return an error if an",2942,301,11.967904806137085

The code does not contain any obvious buffer overflow vulnerabilities, and the input validation is not weak. However, the code does contain a potential use-after-free error, which could lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution if the memory is not properly freed.

Additionally, the code does not contain any memory leaks, as it properly calls delete or free after allocating memory using new or malloc.

Overall, the code is not vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability, but it does contain a potential use-after-free error that should be addressed.",1674,152,5.829236268997192
177909,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `memset` function to set the memory of the `pixBuf` array to zero. However, the size of the array is not properly validated, which allows an attacker to overflow the buffer and write arbitrary data to the memory. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, including the execution of malicious code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted request to the application, which would cause the `memset` function to write data to the `pixBuf` array. The attacker would need to know the size of the array and the location of the buffer in memory. Once the buffer is overflowed, the attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code, including the execution of malicious code.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly validate the size of the `pixBuf` array and ensure that it is not overflowed. Additionally, the code should use a safer function to set the memory of the array to zero, such as `memset_s` or `memset_safe`.",1678,296,11.250523090362549
177910,DoS,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a DoS attack.

The code is a function that takes in a vector of strings and returns a vector of strings. It does not have any obvious vulnerabilities, and it does not appear to be vulnerable to a DoS attack.

However, it is important to note that the code is not complete, and it may be vulnerable to other types of attacks or errors. For example, it does not handle errors or exceptions properly, which could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. Additionally, the code does not appear to be properly validating user input, which could lead to buffer overflows or other security vulnerabilities.",1246,141,5.325615167617798
177911,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro, which reads a 32-bit unsigned integer from a buffer. If the buffer is not properly aligned, or if the integer is too large to fit in 32 bits, the macro will read beyond the end of the buffer, leading to an overflow. This can cause the program to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to a denial-of-service or remote code execution vulnerability.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input to the `tt_cmap10_validate` function, which will cause the program to read beyond the end of the buffer and execute arbitrary code.",1140,202,7.637524604797363

The code checks the length of the input buffer and the number of groups in the table, and it also checks that the start and end values of each group are in increasing order. It also checks that the start_id value is less than the number of valid glyphs.

There is no obvious overflow vulnerability in the code, and it does not appear to be vulnerable to any other type of attack.",1388,103,4.051739454269409
177913,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code checks the length of the input buffer and the number of groups in the cmap8 table, and then iterates over the groups to check their validity. It also checks the start and end values of each group to ensure they are in increasing order.

There is no obvious vulnerability in the code that could lead to an Exec Code Overflow. The code appears to be properly bounds-checked and does not contain any obvious buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

However, it is important to note that the code is using the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro to read the values from the input buffer, which could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the input buffer is not properly null-terminated. However, this is not a vulnerability in the code itself, but rather a potential issue with the input data.",2426,188,7.501449823379517
177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` and `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macros, which are used to read data from the input stream. However, these macros do not perform any bounds checking on the input data, which can lead to an integer overflow if the input data is too large. Specifically, the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` macro reads the number of bytes to be read from the input stream, and the `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macro reads the data from the input stream into a buffer. However, if the number of bytes to be read is too large, it can cause an integer overflow, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input stream with a large number of bytes to be read, which can cause the program to write to an arbitrary location in memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",1976,259,10.495784282684326

177918,Exec Code,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `XListExtensions` has a buffer overflow vulnerability because it uses the `strcpy` function to copy the extension names into a buffer, but it does not check the size of the buffer before copying the data. This means that if the extension names are longer than the buffer size, the function will overwrite the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `rep.length` field in the `xListExtensionsReply` structure is a signed integer, but the `rlen` variable is an unsigned integer. When the `rep.length` field is negative, the `rlen` variable will be larger than the buffer size, leading to a buffer overflow.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted request to the `XListExtensions` function, with a negative `rep.length` field. The attacker could then use the buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code on the server.

The CVE-ID for this vulnerability is CVE-2018-14600, and the CWE-ID is CWE-787.",1733,262,9.55126142501831

Therefore, the code does not have any vulnerabilities related to bypassing security checks.",1760,91,3.8724029064178467
177926,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code is a function that takes in a list of recipes, a list of ingredients for each recipe, and a list of supplies. It returns a list of recipes that can be made using the given supplies.

The function uses a breadth-first search algorithm to find the recipes that can be made using the given supplies. It maintains an adjacency list to keep track of the ingredients for each recipe and the recipes that use each ingredient. It also maintains an in-degree map to keep track of the number of recipes that use each ingredient.

The function iterates over the supplies and adds them to the queue. It then iterates over the queue and for each recipe in the queue, it checks if it can be made using the current supplies. If it can be made, it adds the recipe to the result list. If it cannot be made, it adds the recipes that use the current recipe to the queue.

The function does not use any user-supplied data, so it is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.",1733,254,9.8870108127594
177927,nan,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function takes a string as input and copies it into a buffer without checking the size of the input. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is too large. The vulnerability is in the line `buf = emalloc(data_len + EVP_CIPHER_CTX_block_size(ctx));`. The `data_len` variable is not properly validated, and the `EVP_CIPHER_CTX_block_size(ctx)` function returns the block size of the cipher, which can be larger than the input string. This can cause the buffer to overflow and potentially lead to a crash or other security vulnerability.",3892,155,6.4193596839904785
