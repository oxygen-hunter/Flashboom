The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code allows a symlink to point outside of a share, which can bypass intended file-access restrictions. This can be exploited by creating a symlink that points to a file outside of the share, and then accessing the symlink. The code does not properly check the path of the symlink, which allows an attacker to access files outside of the share.

177856,nan,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `singleDivisorTriplet` takes a vector of integers as input, and then iterates over the unique elements in the vector to find the number of triplets that sum to zero. The function uses a naive approach to find the triplets, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input vector is large enough.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `check` function, which takes three integers as input and returns `true` if the sum of the three integers is zero. The function does not perform any bounds checking on the input integers, which means that it can read beyond the end of the input vector if the input vector is large enough. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a specially crafted input vector that contains a large number of integers. The attacker would need to ensure that the sum of the integers in the vector is zero, which can be done by carefully selecting the integers in the vector. Once the attacker has crafted the input vector, they can use it to execute arbitrary code by exploiting the buffer overflow.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a specially crafted input that causes the `lineDashStartPhase` value to be very large. This can be done by providing a specially crafted input that causes the `lineDashTotal` value to be very large, and then using the `splashFloor` function to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The attacker would then need to provide a specially crafted input that causes the `",3094,301,11.211921691894531
177907,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The code does not contain any obvious buffer overflows or use-after-free errors. However, it does contain a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the line `pix = (pix * d) >> 23;`. If the value of `pix` is close to the maximum value of an integer, and the value of `d` is close to 1, then the multiplication `pix * d` may overflow and result in an incorrect value.

Additionally, the code does not appear to contain any other vulnerabilities, such as memory leaks, use-after-free errors, or integer overflows.

Therefore, the answer to the question ""Is the given code vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability?"" is ""NO"".",1826,192,7.694251537322998
177909,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The code does not contain any buffer overflow vulnerabilities, as it does not involve any user-supplied data or unvalidated user input. The code also does not contain any use-after-free errors, as the memory is properly deallocated and the pointers are not used after the memory has been deallocated.

The code does contain some potential security vulnerabilities, such as integer overflow/underflow, null pointer dereference, and improper error handling. However, these vulnerabilities are not related to the DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

Therefore, the answer to the question ""Is the given code vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability?"" is NO.",1830,175,6.581781625747681

177912,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro, which reads a 32-bit unsigned integer from the input buffer. However, the macro does not perform any bounds checking, which means that it can read beyond the end of the input buffer, potentially leading to an overflow.

In the given code, the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro is used to read the `length` variable, which is then used to access the `table` array. However, the `length` variable is not properly bounds-checked, which means that the `table` array can be accessed beyond its bounds. This can lead to an overflow, which can result in the execution of arbitrary code.

Therefore, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability.",1540,224,8.177435874938965
177913,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code checks the validity of a table by checking the values of the `is32` array, which is used to determine whether a particular value is in the range of a 32-bit integer. The code also checks that the values in the `is32` array are properly set, which helps prevent buffer overflows.

Therefore, the code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to Exec Code Overflow.",2578,107,4.33578896522522
177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_READ_USHORT()` function, which reads a 16-bit value from the input stream. If the value is greater than 65535, it will overflow and wrap around to a negative value. This can lead to an integer overflow in the `glyph_sid` variable, which is then used as an index into the `sids` array. This can cause the program to access memory outside the array bounds, leading to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input that causes the `glyph_sid` variable to overflow. This can be done by sending a large value for the `offset` parameter, which will cause the `FT_READ_USHORT()` function to read a value that is greater than 65535. The overflow will then cause the `glyph_sid` variable to wrap around to a negative value, which can be used to access memory outside the array bounds.

To fix the vulnerability, the `FT_READ_USHORT()` function should be replaced with",2128,301,11.413989067077637

177922,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. The vulnerability is caused by the `add_param_to_argv` function, which does not properly check the size of the `param_buffer` array before writing to it. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is longer than the size of the buffer, causing the program to write to memory outside of the allocated buffer.

The vulnerability is related to CWE-120, which is a type of buffer overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID for this vulnerability is CVE-2019-11360.

The recommended fix for this vulnerability is to properly check the size of the `param_buffer` array before writing to it. This can be done by using a technique such as the `snprintf` function, which allows you to specify the maximum size of the output buffer and returns the number of characters written to the buffer. Alternatively, you can use a technique such as the `strnlen` function, which returns the length of a string up to a certain number of characters.
