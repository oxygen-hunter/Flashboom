177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The function uses a map to check for specific user account control (UAC) bits and corresponding GUIDs. However, it does not properly check for administrative privileges, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC. The attacker can then use the Bypass vulnerability to bypass intended access restrictions and access sensitive data.

The fix for this vulnerability is to properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This can be done by adding additional checks to ensure that the user has the necessary privileges to perform the operation.",2548,268,10.198021411895752

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `fz_try` macro, which catches all exceptions and rethrows them as `FZ_ERROR_TRYLATER`. This allows an attacker to cause the parser to enter an infinite loop, leading to a denial of service.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to craft a specially crafted PDF file that causes the parser to enter the infinite loop. This can be done by providing a malicious PDF file that contains a crafted `pdf_xobject` object with a large number of nested `pdf_xobject` objects, each of which has a `pdf_xobject_matrix` function that returns a large matrix. This causes the parser to allocate a large amount of memory and eventually enter the infinite loop.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the number of bytes read.

The code is a function that implements a simple LZW decompressor. It takes a compressed stream as input and generates the corresponding uncompressed stream. The function uses a stack to store the output characters in reverse order. The stack is initialized with the first character of the input stream.

The function then iterates over the input stream, reading one character at a time. For each character, it checks if it is a clear code (i.e., the code is equal to 255). If it is, the function clears the table by setting all entries to 0. It then reads the next character from the input stream and sets it as the new clear code.

The function then checks if the code is a special case for the KwKwK string. If it is, the function generates the output characters in reverse order and stores them in the stack.

If the code is not a special case, the function checks if it is present in the table. If it is, the function generates the output characters in reverse order and stores them in the stack.

The function then generates the new entry in the table by setting the prefix of the new entry to the old code and the suffix to the new character. It then sets the old code to the new code and the new character to the finchar.

177922,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow. The function `add_param_to_argv` is not responsible for executing any code, it only manipulates a buffer and adds it to an array. The vulnerability is in the `add_argv` function, which is not shown in the code snippet.",2282,70,2.951160192489624
177923,Bypass,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability. The code checks the input parameters for null or empty values, and it also checks if the file exists before moving it. Additionally, it checks if the file can be moved or copied, and it logs an error message if the file cannot be moved or copied.

Therefore, the code does not have any vulnerabilities related to bypassing security checks.",1884,91,3.544203281402588
177926,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code is a function that takes in a GstTagList pointer, a base64-encoded image data string, and a base64-encoded image data length. It decodes the base64-encoded image data and then converts it to a GstBuffer object. Finally, it adds the GstBuffer object to the GstTagList object.

The code does not contain any integer overflows or underflows, and it does not contain any buffer overflows or use-after-free errors. It also does not contain any memory leaks or improper input validation errors.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.",1857,157,5.717513561248779
177927,nan,"  NO, the code is not vulnerable to a nan vulnerability. The code is a C++ function that implements the OpenSSL sealing algorithm for encrypting data using public keys. It does not contain any nan vulnerabilities.",4016,48,2.4914801120758057
