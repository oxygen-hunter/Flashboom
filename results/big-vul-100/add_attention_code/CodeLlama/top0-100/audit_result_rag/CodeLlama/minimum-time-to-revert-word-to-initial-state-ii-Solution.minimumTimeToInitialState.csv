The vulnerability arises from the use of the `lex_expect` function, which expects a specific token to be present in the input. However, if the token is not present, the function will continue to consume input until it finds the expected token or reaches the end of the input. This can lead to a stack buffer overflow if the input is malicious and contains a large number of tokens that are not expected.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malicious input that contains a large number of tokens that are not expected, causing the `lex_expect` function to consume a large amount of memory and eventually leading to a stack buffer overflow.

Vulnerability summary:
In Artifex Ghostscript before 9.24, attackers able to supply crafted PostScript files could use a type confusion in the setcolor function to crash the interpreter or possibly have unspecified other impact.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `float_params` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the number of operands is greater than the size of the `cc.paint.values` array. The `float_params` function is used to gather the numeric operands for the `setcolor` function, and it does not perform any bounds checking on the number of operands. As a result, an attacker can supply a large number of operands, causing the `cc.paint.values` array to overflow, leading to a nan vulnerability.

177910,DoS,  NO. The code is not vulnerable to a DoS attack. The function `minimumTimeToInitialState` is not related to the vulnerability.,1281,34,1.488389253616333
177911,Exec Code Overflow,  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow. It is a correct implementation of the `tt_cmap10_validate` function.,1175,35,1.552546501159668
177912,Exec Code Overflow,  NO. The code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow. The function `minimumTimeToInitialState` is not related to the vulnerability.,1423,33,1.4935123920440674
177913,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code checks the length of the input table and the number of groups in the table, and then iterates over the groups to check if they are in increasing order. It also checks if the start and end values of each group are within the valid range.

There is no obvious vulnerability in the code that could lead to an Exec Code Overflow. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to any other type of vulnerability, such as buffer overflow or use-after-free.

However, it is important to note that the code is not complete and may have other vulnerabilities that are not apparent from the given snippet. It is always a good idea to review the entire codebase and not just focus on a single function or snippet.",2461,171,6.667614698410034
177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `min` function in the `minimumTimeToInitialState` function, which can cause an integer overflow if the input `k` is large enough. Specifically, the `min` function is used to compute the minimum value of `r - i + 1` and `z[i - l]`. If `r - i + 1` is equal to `INT_MAX`, then `z[i - l]` will be equal to `INT_MAX` as well, causing an integer overflow when computing `min(r - i + 1, z[i - l])`. This can lead to an out-of-bounds write, which can potentially execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the `min` function should be replaced with a safer function that can handle large values, such as the `std::min` function from the C++ standard library. Alternatively, the `min` function can be replaced with a custom implementation that avoids integer overflows.",2011,268,9.860326766967773
177917,Exec Code,  NO. The code is not vulnerable to Exec_Code.,1724,15,0.9083597660064697
177918,Exec Code,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `XListExtensions` allocates memory for a list of strings using `Xmalloc`, and then reads a list of strings from the server using `_XReadPad`. The length of the list is determined by the `rep.nExtensions` field, which is an integer. However, the length of the list is not validated, and the function does not check if the length of the list exceeds the maximum allowed length.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of extensions to the server, causing the `rep.nExtensions` field to overflow and overwrite the return address on the stack. The return address can then be overwritten with the address of a malicious function, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

The vulnerability is related to the CWE-120 (Buffer Overflow) and CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) security vulnerabilities.",1768,213,7.949259042739868
177919,nan,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a nan vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2018-14599. The CWE-ID is CWE-682.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function `minimumTimeToInitialState` uses the `z_function` function, which is vulnerable to off-by-one errors. The `z_function` function calculates the z-function of a string, which is a function that tells the minimum number of characters that need to be shifted to the right to make the string a prefix of itself. The function is vulnerable to off-by-one errors because it assumes that the z-function is always non-zero, which is not always the case.

For example, if the input string is ""abc"", then the z-function would be [0, 1, 2]. However, if the input string is ""abca"", then the z-function would be [0, 1, 2, 3], which is not correct. The function would return 3 instead of 4, which is the correct answer.

Therefore, the `minimumTimeToInitialState` function is vulnerable to off-by-one errors, which can lead to incorrect results and potentially cause a DoS or other security vulnerabilities.",2313,295,11.024425268173218

177922,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2019-11360. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `strcpy` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the destination buffer is not large enough to hold the source string. In this case, the `strcpy` function is used to copy the `param_buffer` string into the `argv` array, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the `param_buffer` string is too large.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft an iptables-save file that contains a long string in the `param_buffer` variable, which can cause a buffer overflow when the `strcpy` function is called. This can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution or a crash of the program.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that the `param_buffer` variable is properly bounded and that the `strcpy` function is used safely.",2193,235,9.216104984283447
177923,Bypass,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-2348. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code truncates a pathname upon encountering a null character (\x00) in the second argument, which allows an attacker to bypass intended extension restrictions and create files with unexpected names. This can be exploited to bypass security restrictions and create files with arbitrary names, leading to potential security issues.",1795,125,4.773295879364014
177926,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code is a function that takes a string and an integer as input, and it returns the minimum time it takes to reach the initial state of the string. The function uses a Z-function to compute the minimum time.

The Z-function is a preprocessing step that computes the length of the longest substring starting at each position in the string that is palindromic. The function then uses this information to compute the minimum time it takes to reach the initial state of the string.

There is no direct way to exploit this function to execute arbitrary code, as the input string is not being used to execute any code. The function is only being used to compute a value that is then returned to the caller.

Therefore, this function is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.",1768,183,6.803715229034424
177927,nan,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The function takes a string as input and uses the strcpy function to copy the string into a buffer. The buffer is allocated on the stack, and the size of the buffer is not checked. This means that if the input string is longer than the size of the buffer, it will overflow the buffer and cause a buffer overflow vulnerability.",3927,85,3.980254650115967
