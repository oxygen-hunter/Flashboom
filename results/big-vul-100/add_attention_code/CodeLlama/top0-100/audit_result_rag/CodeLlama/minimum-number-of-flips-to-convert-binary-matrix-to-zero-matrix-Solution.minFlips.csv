The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are necessary to create machine accounts. This allows an attacker to create a machine account with the desired UAC bits set, even if they do not have the necessary rights.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC. The attacker can then create a machine account with the desired UAC bits set, which will bypass intended access restrictions.

The recommended fix is to properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This can be done by checking for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object.",2548,278,11.335193395614624

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number.

The code checks the input values for validity and returns an error if the input is invalid. It also checks the input values against the maximum allowed value for the given type, which helps prevent integer overflows.

Therefore, the code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to Exec Code Overflow.",2550,79,3.4455676078796387
177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` and `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macros, which are used to read and write data to the stream. These macros use the `FT_READ_BYTE` and `FT_READ_USHORT` functions, which can cause an integer overflow if the number of bytes or words to be read exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the integer type.

For example, if the `num_glyphs` variable is set to a large value, the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` macro will attempt to read `num_glyphs - 1` * 2 bytes from the stream, which can cause an integer overflow if `num_glyphs` is greater than the maximum value that can be represented by the integer type. Similarly, the `FT_READ_USHORT` function can also cause an integer overflow if the number of words to be read exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the integer type.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that the values of `num_glyphs` and",2100,301,11.523876905441284

The code is a function that retrieves a list of font paths from the X server using the XGetFontPath function. It does not appear to contain any code that could be used to execute arbitrary code.

However, the code does use the XReadPad function to read data from the X server, which could potentially be used to execute arbitrary code if the data being read is not properly validated. However, the code does not appear to contain any vulnerabilities related to this.

Overall, the code appears to be well-written and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.",1813,139,5.537006378173828
177918,Exec Code,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec_Code.

The code does not contain any direct or indirect use of the `system` function, which is a common method for executing shell commands in C++. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to Exec_Code.

However, the code does contain a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `_XReadPad` function. The `rlen` variable is calculated as `rep.length << 2`, which can potentially overflow if `rep.length` is a large value. This can cause the program to read beyond the end of the allocated memory buffer, leading to unpredictable behavior.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should ensure that `rep.length` is validated before using it to calculate `rlen`. Additionally, the code should use a safer function to read data from the network, such as `recv` or `read`, to prevent buffer overflows.",1857,203,8.062191724777222

Additionally, it checks if the new path is within the open_basedir, which is a security feature that prevents accessing files outside of the allowed directory.

The code also uses the php_check_open_basedir function to check if the new path is within the open_basedir, which is a security feature that prevents accessing files outside of the allowed directory.

The code also uses the php_copy_file_ex function to copy the file, which is a safer alternative to the rename function.
