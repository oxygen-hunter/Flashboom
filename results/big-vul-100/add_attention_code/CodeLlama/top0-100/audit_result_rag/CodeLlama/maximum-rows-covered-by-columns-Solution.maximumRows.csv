The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the code. The function `GfxImageColorMap::GfxImageColorMap` takes an integer `bitsA` as input, which is used to determine the maximum value of the pixel values. If the value of `bitsA` is too large, it can cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect calculation of the maximum pixel value. This can result in a buffer overflow, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:

If `bits` is a large value, the left shift operation will cause an integer overflow, resulting in a negative value for `maxPixel`. This can lead to a buffer overflow when the `lookup` array is allocated, as the size of the array is determined by `maxPixel`.

* Memory leak: The code does not check if the memory allocated by the `new` operator has been freed before allocating new memory. This can lead to memory leaks.
* Improper error handling: The code does not handle errors properly, which can lead to crashes or unpredictable behavior.
* Insecure function usage: The code uses the `strcpy` function, which can lead to buffer overflows if the destination buffer is not large enough.

The `next_popcount` function is a simple implementation of the next power of 2 algorithm, which is used to generate the next bit mask. It works by finding the lowest bit that is set in the input number, and then adding that bit to the input number. This generates the next bit mask by adding the lowest bit to the input number.

177850,DoS Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a DoS_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-5289. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `maximumRows` function takes an integer `numSelect` as an argument, and then uses a loop to iterate over all possible bitmasks of length `numSelect` that can be formed using the elements of the `matrix` vector. The function then counts the number of rows in the matrix that have a 1 in each bit position corresponding to a 1 in the bitmask, and returns the maximum count.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `next_popcount` function used in the loop has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `matrix` vector. This means that the time complexity of the `maximumRows` function is O(2^n), which can be very slow for large values of n.

In particular, if the `numSelect` argument is set to a large value, the loop will iterate over a large number of bitmasks, and the time complexity of the function will be very high.

177911,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro, which reads a 32-bit integer from the input buffer without performing any bounds checking. If the input buffer is not properly initialized or if the input data is malicious, it can cause an integer overflow, leading to an out-of-bounds read and potentially executing arbitrary code.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input that causes the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro to read data beyond the bounds of the input buffer, leading to an integer overflow and potentially executing arbitrary code.",1231,183,6.841160774230957

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro, which reads the next 32-bit value from the input buffer without performing any bounds checking. If the input buffer is not properly validated, an attacker can provide a malicious input that causes the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro to read beyond the end of the input buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. This can result in the execution of arbitrary code, potentially leading to a remote code execution vulnerability.",1479,161,5.972872018814087
177913,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro, which reads the next 32-bit value from the input buffer without performing any bounds checking. This allows an attacker to provide an input that is longer than the expected length, leading to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability can be exploited by providing an input that is longer than the expected length, causing the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro to read beyond the end of the input buffer. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control of the system or steal sensitive information.

To fix this vulnerability, the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro should be modified to perform bounds checking before reading the next 32-bit value from the input buffer. This can be done by checking if the input buffer is large enough to hold the next 32-bit value, and if not, returning an error.",2517,259,9.610209941864014
177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `maximumRows` function, which takes a vector of vectors of integers as input and returns the maximum number of rows that can be selected from the input matrix. The function uses a loop to iterate over the input matrix and counts the number of rows that have all elements set to 1. However, the function does not check for integer overflows, which can lead to incorrect results if the input matrix is too large.

For example, if the input matrix has a large number of rows and columns, the function can overflow the integer variables used to store the number of rows and columns, leading to incorrect results. This can result in the function returning an incorrect value, which can be used to execute arbitrary code.

Therefore, it is recommended to check for integer overflows in the `maximumRows` function to prevent this vulnerability.",2067,235,8.585406064987183

177919,nan,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `XListFonts` takes a pattern as input, which can be a malicious string that is longer than the maximum allowed length. If the pattern is longer than the maximum allowed length, it will cause a buffer overflow, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check the length of the pattern before allocating memory for it. It assumes that the pattern is a null-terminated string, which is not always the case. The function should have checked the length of the pattern before allocating memory for it, and should have used a bounded buffer to prevent buffer overflows.

The vulnerability is also caused by the fact that the function does not properly null-terminate the strings it reads from the server. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, including arbitrary code execution.

177922,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strcpy` function, which can copy more characters than the destination buffer can hold. This can lead to an overflow, which can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a specially crafted input that causes the `strcpy` function to copy more characters than the destination buffer can hold. This can be done by providing a long string that is longer than the destination buffer, or by using a specially crafted input that causes the `strcpy` function to copy more characters than the destination buffer can hold.
