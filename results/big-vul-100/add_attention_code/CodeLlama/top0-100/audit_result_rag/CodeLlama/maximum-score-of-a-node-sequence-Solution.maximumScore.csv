The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are required to create machine accounts. This allows an attacker to create a machine account with the desired UAC bits set, even if they do not have the necessary rights.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC. The attacker can then create a machine account with the desired UAC bits set, which will bypass intended access restrictions.

The `ImageStream` class has a buffer size of 4096 bytes, which can be overflowed by a crafted PDF file.

The vulnerability arises from the use of integer overflows in the calculation of the rowSize variable. The rowSize variable is calculated as follows:

If the width variable is large enough, the result of the expression (width + 7) will be greater than 2^31-1, which is the maximum value that can be represented by an integer in C++. When this happens, the result of the expression will be negative, which will cause an integer overflow.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a PDF file with a large value for the width variable, which will cause the rowSize variable to overflow and result in a negative value. This will cause the data pointer to be set to a negative value, which will cause a crash when the application tries to access the memory at that location.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the LZW decompressor in the BufCompressedFill function in fontfile/decompress.c in X.Org libXfont before 1.4.4 and in compress/compress.c in 4.3BSD, as used in zopen.c in OpenBSD before 3.8, FreeBSD, NetBSD 4.0.x and 5.0.x before 5.0.3 and 5.1.x before 5.1.1, FreeType 2.1.9, and other products, does not properly handle code words that are absent from the decompression table when encountered. This can lead to an infinite loop or a heap-based buffer overflow, and possibly execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the decompressor uses a stack to store the decompressed data, and it does not properly check the size of the stack before pushing new data onto it. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the stack is not properly sized, and the decompressor tries to push more data onto the stack than it can",2254,301,12.097012758255005

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` and `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macros, which are used to read data from the input stream. However, these macros do not perform any bounds checking on the input data, which can lead to an integer overflow if the input data is too large. Specifically, the `FT_FRAME_ENTER` macro reads the number of bytes to be read from the input stream, and the `FT_FRAME_EXIT` macro reads the data from the input stream into a buffer. However, if the number of bytes to be read is too large, it can cause an integer overflow, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input stream with a large number of bytes to be read, which can cause the program to read data from an unexpected location in memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",2041,260,10.121526956558228

177922,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow. The code is a function that takes a string and a line number as input, and it parses the string to extract parameters. It does not execute any code, and it does not have any buffer overflow vulnerabilities.",2223,61,2.553062915802002
177923,Bypass,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability. The code checks the input parameters for null or empty values, and it also checks if the file exists before moving it. Additionally, it checks if the new path is within the open_basedir, if it is set.

The code also uses the php_check_open_basedir function to check if the new path is within the open_basedir, if it is set. This function checks if the new path is within the open_basedir, and if it is not, it returns false.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability.",1825,141,5.717660427093506
177926,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code is a function that takes in a vector of integers and a vector of vectors of integers, and returns the maximum score that can be achieved by combining the integers in the vector of integers with the integers in the vector of vectors of integers. The function does not appear to have any vulnerabilities related to Exec Code Overflow.",1798,83,3.306947708129883
