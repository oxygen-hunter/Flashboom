177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The function uses a hardcoded list of GUIDs to check for specific user account control flags, but it does not properly check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended access restrictions and create machine accounts with the desired user account control flags.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted request to the function, which would allow an attacker to create machine accounts with the desired user account control flags. This could potentially be used to bypass intended access restrictions and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems.",2594,250,9.431285619735718

The code is using the `estrdup` function to allocate memory for the `strbuf` variable, which is a buffer that is used to store the time string. The `estrdup` function is a wrapper around the `malloc` function, which allocates memory from the heap. The memory allocated by `estrdup` is not freed until the `strbuf` variable goes out of scope, which is when the function returns.

Therefore, there is no memory leak in the code.

Additionally, the code is not using any deprecated or insecure functions, such as `strcpy`, `gets`, or `scanf`. It is using the `snprintf` function to format the time string, which is a safer alternative to `sprintf`.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `gnutls_session_get_data` function does not perform any bounds checking on the `session_data` parameter, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input data is too large. The function assumes that the input data is of a fixed size, but it does not check if the input data is actually of that size. This can cause the function to write beyond the end of the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a large input data to the `gnutls_session_get_data` function, which can cause the function to write beyond the end of the allocated buffer and overwrite other parts of the program's memory. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability, as the program may crash or behave unexpectedly.

To fix the vulnerability, the function should perform proper bounds checking on the `session_data` parameter to ensure that it is of the expected size. This can be done by using a technique such as the ""boundscheck"" function from the ""check"" library.",1336,290,11.177961111068726

177856,nan,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `executeInstructions` takes a string `s` as input, and uses a `unordered_map` to store the indices of the characters in the string. The map is initialized with the values of `x0` and `y0`, which are the coordinates of the starting point of the robot. The function then iterates over the characters in the string, and for each character, it checks if the corresponding index is already present in the map. If it is, it updates the value of the index to the minimum of the current value and the current index.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the map is not properly initialized. The map is initialized with the values of `x0` and `y0`, but these values are not necessarily valid indices in the string. If the string is empty, or if the starting point of the robot is not at the beginning of the string, then the map will contain invalid indices, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can provide a string with a large number of characters, and then provide a starting point that is not at the beginning of the string.

177905,DoS,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS attack. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `imgCoordMungeLowerC` and `imgCoordMungeUpperC` functions, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input data is not properly validated. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted input that causes the buffer to overflow, leading to a crash or denial of service.",3627,97,4.105340242385864
177906,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashDist` function, which calculates the distance between two points. The function takes two `SplashCoord` arguments, `x0` and `y0`, and returns the distance between them. However, the function does not properly validate the input values, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input values are too large.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input string to the `makeDashedPath` function, which will cause the `splashDist` function to overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, as well as the execution of arbitrary code.

To fix the vulnerability, the `splashDist` function should properly validate the input values to prevent buffer overflows. Additionally, the `makeDashedPath` function should be updated to properly handle the case where the input string is too large, and to return an error code instead of crashing the application.",3112,279,11.846510887145996
177907,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The code does not contain any buffer overflow vulnerabilities, as it does not involve any user-supplied data or unvalidated user input. The code also does not contain any use-after-free errors, as the memory is properly deallocated and the pointers are not used after the memory has been deallocated.

The code does contain some potential security vulnerabilities, such as integer overflow/underflow, null pointer dereference, and improper error handling. However, these vulnerabilities are not related to the DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

Therefore, the answer to the question is NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.",1844,175,7.356741189956665
177909,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2013-1788. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gmalloc` and `gmallocn` functions, which allocate memory on the heap. If an attacker can control the input to these functions, they can potentially cause a buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `gmalloc` and `gmallocn` functions do not perform any bounds checking on the input parameters. This means that an attacker can pass in a large value for the `size` parameter, which will cause the function to allocate a large amount of memory on the heap. If the attacker can also control the value of the `align` parameter, they can potentially cause a buffer overflow by passing in a large value that is not a multiple of the alignment.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted input to the `scaleMaskYdXu` function, which would cause a buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code. This could potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application, leading to a denial of service or other security vulnerabilities.

177912,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro, which is used to read a 32-bit unsigned integer from a buffer. The macro is defined as follows:
```
#define TT_NEXT_ULONG(p)  (((p)[0] << 24) | ((p)[1] << 16) | ((p)[2] << 8) | (p)[3])
```
The vulnerability occurs when the input buffer is not properly validated, and an attacker can craft a malicious input that causes the macro to read beyond the end of the buffer. This can lead to an integer overflow, which can result in the execution of arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to craft a specially crafted input that causes the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro to read beyond the end of the buffer. This can be done by providing a specially crafted input that causes the macro to read beyond the end of the buffer, leading to an integer overflow and the execution of arbitrary code.

177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `executeInstructions` function, which takes a string as input and executes instructions based on the characters in the string. The function uses a static map to store the directions, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `executeInstructions` function does not properly validate the input string, and allows an attacker to inject malicious code by manipulating the input string. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) or other security vulnerabilities.

To fix the vulnerability, the `executeInstructions` function should properly validate the input string and prevent the execution of malicious code. This can be done by implementing proper input validation and sanitization mechanisms, such as using a whitelist of allowed characters or using a secure input sanitization library.",2146,246,10.080273866653442
177917,Exec Code,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code. The code is a function that takes in a Display pointer, an integer pointer, and a string pointer as input, and returns a pointer to a vector of integers.

177919,nan,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `XListFonts` takes a pattern as input, which can be a malicious string that is longer than the maximum allowed length. If the pattern is longer than the maximum allowed length, it can cause a buffer overflow, leading to an exploitable crash or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check the length of the pattern before allocating memory for it. It assumes that the pattern is a null-terminated string, which is not always the case. The function should have checked the length of the pattern before allocating memory for it, and should have used a bounded buffer to prevent buffer overflows.

177923,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-2348. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `move_uploaded_file` function truncates a pathname upon encountering a null character (`\x00`) in the second argument. This allows an attacker to bypass intended extension restrictions and create files with unexpected names.

For example, if the second argument is `test.txt\x00.jpg`, the function will only move the file `test.txt` to `test.jpg`, which is not the intended behavior.

This vulnerability is similar to the one described in CVE-2006-7243, but it is not the same. The fix for CVE-2006-7243 was incomplete, and this vulnerability is a result of that.",1930,216,9.005466222763062
177926,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The function `executeInstructions` takes in a vector of integers `startPos` and a string `s` as input, and returns a vector of integers of the same length as `s`. The function uses a static map `directions` to map each character in `s` to a pair of integers representing the direction of movement in the x and y directions. The function then uses a loop to iterate over each character in `s` and update the values in the `result` vector accordingly.

The function does not appear to have any vulnerabilities related to Exec Code Overflow, as it does not execute any code based on user input. The only user input that is used in the function is the `startPos` vector, which is used to initialize the values in the `result` vector. The `result` vector is then returned to the caller, and the function does not execute any code based on the values in the `result` vector.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.",1903,229,8.896561861038208
177927,nan,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function takes a string as input and copies it into a buffer without checking the size of the input. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is too large. The vulnerability is in the line `buf = emalloc(data_len + EVP_CIPHER_CTX_block_size(ctx));`. The `data_len` variable is not properly bounded, and the `EVP_CIPHER_CTX_block_size(ctx)` function returns the block size of the cipher, which can be large. This means that the buffer allocated by the `emalloc` function is too small to hold the input string, leading to a buffer overflow.",4062,159,7.354849100112915
