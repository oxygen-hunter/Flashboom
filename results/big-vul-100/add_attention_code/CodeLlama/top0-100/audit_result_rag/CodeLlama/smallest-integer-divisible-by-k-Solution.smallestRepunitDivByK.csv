177907,DoS Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability.

The code is a function that scales a mask image by a given scale factor. It takes in a source image, a source data pointer, a source width, a source height, a scaled width, a scaled height, and a destination bitmap pointer. It then scales the image by iterating over the source image, copying the pixels to the destination bitmap, and scaling the pixels as needed.

The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or use-after-free errors. However, it does contain some potential issues that could lead to security vulnerabilities if not properly handled.

For example, the code uses the `gmalloc` function to allocate memory for the line buffer, which could potentially lead to a memory leak if the memory is not properly freed. Additionally, the code does not properly validate the input parameters, which could lead to crashes or other security vulnerabilities if the input parameters are not properly validated.

However, the code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial-of-service or execute arbitrary code. The code is designed to scale the image and copy the pixels to the destination bitmap, and it does not contain any logic that could be exploited to cause a security vulnerability.

The code is a function that scales a mask image by a given scale factor. It takes in a source image, a source data pointer, a source width, a source height, a scaled width, a scaled height, and a destination bitmap pointer. It then scales the image by iterating over the source image, copying the pixels to the destination bitmap, and scaling the pixels as it goes.

The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or use-after-free errors. However, it does contain a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the line `pix = (pix * d) >> 23;`. If the value of `d` is greater than 2^23, then the result of the multiplication will be greater than 2^24, which will cause an integer overflow. This could potentially lead to incorrect results or buffer miscalculations.

However, the code does not appear to be vulnerable to a DoS_Exec_Code_Overflow vulnerability. The vulnerability you mentioned is a specific type of buffer overflow that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. The code you provided does not contain any obvious buffer overflow vulnerabilities, and it does not appear to be vulnerable to this specific type of vulnerability.

The code is a function that takes a pointer to a byte array and a validator as input, and it checks the validity of a table. The function does not appear to have any vulnerabilities related to Exec Code Overflow.

The function uses the TT_NEXT_ULONG and TT_NEXT_USHORT macros to read values from the table, which are then used to determine the length and count of the table. The function then checks that the table is within the validator's limit and that the length and count are valid.

The function also checks that the glyph indices in the table are valid, but it does not appear to be vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code is a function that takes a pointer to a table and a validator as input, and it performs some checks on the table. However, it does not appear to have any code that could potentially lead to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability.

The function first checks that the table is long enough to contain the expected data, and then it reads the length of the table and checks that it is within the validator's limit. It then reads the number of groups in the table and checks that the number of groups is within the validator's limit.

After that, the function loops over the groups and checks that they are in increasing order. It also checks that the start and end values of each group are within the validator's limit.

There is no code in the function that could potentially lead to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The function does not appear to be vulnerable to any type of buffer overflow or use-after-free error.",2554,219,8.741609334945679
177915,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2009-0946. The CWE-ID is CWE-189.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `smallestRepunitDivByK` function, which is a function that finds the smallest positive integer `N` such that `N` is divisible by `K`. The function is vulnerable to an Exec Code Overflow because it uses a loop to find the smallest `N` that satisfies the condition, and the loop can potentially run for a very long time if `K` is a large number. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other types of memory corruption, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is not related to the CFF font format itself, but rather to the way the `smallestRepunitDivByK` function is implemented. The function is not properly bounded, and it can potentially run for a very long time if the input is large enough. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other types of memory corruption, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

To fix the vulnerability, the `smallestRepunitDivByK` function should be properly bounded, and the loop should be terminated when the smallest `N` is found. This can be done by using a fixed-",2104,301,11.598366260528564

The code is a function that takes a Display pointer and an integer pointer as input, and returns a list of strings. It appears to be a safe function that does not contain any vulnerabilities.

The function first locks the display, then gets an empty request, and then checks the reply. If the reply is not valid, it returns NULL. If the reply is valid, it allocates memory for the list and the string, and then reads the data into the string. It then unlocks the display and syncs the handle.

The function does not contain any code that could potentially execute arbitrary code, such as a buffer overflow or use-after-free error. It also does not contain any code that could potentially cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, such as a memory leak or a race condition.
