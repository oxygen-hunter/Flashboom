177918,Exec Code,  NO. The code is not vulnerable to Exec_Code.,1869,15,0.920172929763794
177919,nan,  NO. The code is not vulnerable to a nan vulnerability.,2414,16,1.0755906105041504
177920,nan,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to a nan vulnerability. The function `XGetFontPath` is not used to process user input, and it does not involve any arithmetic operations that can lead to integer overflow or underflow. Therefore, it does not contain any potential vulnerabilities related to integer overflow or underflow.",1814,68,2.966501235961914
177921,nan,  NO. The code is not vulnerable to a nan vulnerability.,1890,16,0.9556105136871338
177922,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow. The function add_param_to_argv is not responsible for executing any code, it only manipulates the parameters of the program.",2294,43,1.9785220623016357
177923,Bypass,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability. The code checks the input parameters for null or empty values before using them, and it also checks the return value of the `zend_parse_parameters` function to ensure that the parameters are of the expected type. Additionally, the code uses the `php_check_open_basedir` function to check if the new path is within the open_basedir, and it uses the `VCWD_RENAME` function to rename the file.

Therefore, the code does not have any obvious vulnerabilities related to bypassing security checks. However, it is still possible that there may be other vulnerabilities present in the code that have not been identified.",1896,156,5.915271997451782
177926,Exec Code Overflow,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to Exec Code Overflow.

The code is a function that takes in a base64-encoded image data and converts it into a GstBuffer. It does not appear to have any vulnerabilities related to Exec Code Overflow.",1869,58,2.4343323707580566
177927,nan,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a nan vulnerability. The code is a C++ function that implements the OpenSSL sealing algorithm for encrypting data using public keys. It does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to nan values.",4028,53,2.621797561645508
