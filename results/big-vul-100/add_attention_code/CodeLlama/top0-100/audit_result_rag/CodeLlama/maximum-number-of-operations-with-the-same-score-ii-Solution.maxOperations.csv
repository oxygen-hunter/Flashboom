The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the number of bytes read. This means that if the image data is corrupted or malicious, it can cause the `ImageStream` class to read beyond the end of the stream, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially executing arbitrary code.

To fix the vulnerability, the `ImageStream` class should be modified to perform bounds checking on the number of bytes read.

The `gets` function does not perform any bounds checking, and it does not provide any mechanism for the user to specify the maximum size of the input string.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a specially crafted PDF file that contains a very large string in the `gets` function. This can be done by using a tool such as `pdf-parser` to extract the string from the PDF file, and then modifying the string to make it very large.

177850,DoS Overflow,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a DoS_Overflow vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-5289. The CWE-ID is CWE-119.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `datum_to_json` function does not properly handle the case where the input `val` is a `text` value that contains a large number of characters. The function uses the `OidOutputFunctionCall` function to convert the `val` to a string, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is too large.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted `text` value as the `val` parameter to the `datum_to_json` function. The `text` value should contain a large number of characters, and the attacker should ensure that the `key_scalar` parameter is set to `true`. This will cause the `datum_to_json` function to call the `escape_json` function, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `datum_to_json` function should be modified to properly handle large input strings. One way to do this is to use the `text_to_cstring` function to convert the `text` value to a C string, and",4133,301,12.763530969619751

Vulnerability summary:
vfs.c in smbd in Samba 3.x and 4.x before 4.1.22, 4.2.x before 4.2.7, and 4.3.x before 4.3.3, when share names with certain substring relationships exist, allows remote attackers to bypass intended file-access restrictions via a symlink that points outside of a share.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code checks the stat value of the parent directory before checking if the current directory is below the connect path. This means that an attacker can create a symlink to a directory outside of the share, and then create a symlink to the symlink inside the share. The code will then follow the symlink to the outside directory, and then to the inside directory, allowing the attacker to bypass the intended file-access restrictions.",3158,253,10.299361228942871
177856,nan,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `get_line` reads input from a file and stores it in a buffer, but it does not check the size of the buffer before writing to it. This means that if the input is too large, it will overflow the buffer and cause undefined behavior.

The vulnerability is caused by the `chars_read = get_line ()` line, which reads input from the file and stores it in the `buf` array. However, the function does not check the size of the buffer before writing to it, which means that if the input is too large, it will overflow the buffer and cause undefined behavior.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could provide a specially crafted input file that is larger than the buffer size. This would cause the `get_line` function to overflow the buffer and write data to memory outside of the buffer, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can provide a specially crafted input value that causes an integer overflow.

177922,Exec Code Overflow,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strcpy` function, which can copy more characters than the destination buffer can hold. This can lead to an overflow, which can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a specially crafted input that causes the `strcpy` function to copy more characters than the destination buffer can hold. This can be done by providing a long string that is longer than the destination buffer, and the `strcpy` function will copy the extra characters, leading to an overflow.

The vulnerability is in the `add_param_to_argv` function, which uses the `strcpy` function to copy a string to a buffer. The buffer is defined as `param_buffer[1024]`, which means it can hold up to 1024 characters. However, the `strcpy` function does not check the size of the destination buffer before copying the string, which means it can copy more characters than the buffer can hold. This can lead to an overflow, which can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the `strcpy` function should be replaced with a safer function that checks the size of the destination buffer before copying the string. Alternatively, the buffer size should be increased",2242,301,11.81544804573059
