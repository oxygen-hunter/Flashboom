177736,Bypass,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The function does not check for the presence of the required rights, which are necessary to create machine accounts. This allows an attacker to create machine accounts with the required rights, bypassing the intended access restrictions.

The vulnerability is in the following line of code:
```
if (map[i].uac & user_account_control) {
    //...
}
```
The `map[i].uac` variable is a bitmask that represents the user account control flags. The `user_account_control` variable is the user account control value that is being checked. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for the presence of the required rights in the `map[i].uac` bitmask.

The function should check for the presence of the required rights in the",2694,301,12.128473997116089

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `drawImage` function, which takes a `Stream` object as input and processes it in a way that can lead to a buffer overflow. The function uses the `ImageStream` class to read the input stream, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input stream is maliciously crafted.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted PDF file with a large image that is processed by the `drawImage` function. The image data can be crafted to cause a buffer overflow by sending a large number of pixels, which can lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `drawImage` function should be modified to properly validate the input stream and prevent buffer overflows. Additionally, the `ImageStream` class should be modified to properly handle large input streams and prevent buffer overflows.",3435,244,10.20128059387207

However, the code does contain a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `drawImage` function.

This could lead to a buffer overflow if the `colorMap->getRGBLine` function writes more data to the `dest` pointer than the buffer can hold.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `drawImage` function should ensure that the `width` and `height` values are validated and that the `buffer` variable is allocated with a size that is large enough to hold the data.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `cairo_matrix_init_translate` function, which takes a `double` argument for the translation value. However, the value is not properly validated, and an attacker can potentially provide a large value that causes a buffer overflow. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, potentially allowing the attacker to take control of the system.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `cairo_matrix_init_translate` function does not check the validity of the `tx` and `ty` arguments, which are passed as `double` values. An attacker can potentially provide a large value for these arguments, which will be stored in the `cairo_matrix_t` structure as a `double` value. When the `cairo_matrix_t` structure is used to create a pattern, the `double` value will be used to initialize the translation components of the pattern.

The pattern is created from the `maskImage` surface, which is created from the `maskBuffer` buffer. The `maskBuffer` buffer is created by copying the contents of the `maskStr` stream into it. The `maskStr` stream is a user-supplied stream, which can contain arbitrary data.

The vulnerability occurs when the `maskStr` stream contains a crafted pattern that is used as the `maskPattern` argument to the `cairo_mask` function. The `cairo_mask` function then applies the pattern to the image, which can result in the execution of arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a crafted PDF file that contains a malicious `maskStr` stream. The stream would need to contain a pattern that is used as the `maskPattern` argument to the `cairo_mask` function.
