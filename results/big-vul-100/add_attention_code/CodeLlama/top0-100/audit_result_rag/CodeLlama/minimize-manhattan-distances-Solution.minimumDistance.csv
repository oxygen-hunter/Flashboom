The vulnerability arises from the use of the `ImageStream` class, which is used to read image data from a stream. The `ImageStream` class has a `getLine` method that reads a line of image data from the stream and returns it as a `SplashColorPtr`. The `SplashColorPtr` is a pointer to an array of `SplashColor` objects, where each `SplashColor` object represents a pixel in the image.

The vulnerability occurs when the `ImageStream` class is used to read image data from a stream that contains a crafted image. The crafted image may contain a large number of pixels, which can cause the `ImageStream` class to allocate a large amount of memory to store the pixel data. If the allocated memory is not properly freed, it can lead to a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `datum_to_json` function does not properly handle the `key_scalar` parameter, which is used to determine whether the input value is a scalar or not. If the input value is a scalar, the function does not properly escape the output string, which can lead to a buffer overflow.
