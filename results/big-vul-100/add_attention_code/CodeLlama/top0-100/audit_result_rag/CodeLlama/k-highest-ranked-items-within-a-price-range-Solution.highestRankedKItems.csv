The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are required to set the UF_DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWD, UF_ENCRYPTED_TEXT_PASSWORD_ALLOWED, UF_SERVER_TRUST_ACCOUNT, UF_PARTIAL_SECRETS_ACCOUNT, and UF_INTERDOMAIN_TRUST_ACCOUNT bits in the userAccountControl attribute.

The function appears to be a simple implementation of a BFS algorithm, where the input vector of vectors of integers represents a grid, the input vector of integers represents the starting point of the BFS, and the output vector of vectors of integers represents the result of the BFS.

The function does not appear to have any vulnerabilities related to security, such as buffer overflows, use after free, memory leaks, integer overflow/underflow, null pointer dereference, improper input validation, race conditions, insecure function usage, insecure resource management, improper error handling, cryptographic issues, or sensitive data exposure.

The code is using the `zend_hash_has_more_elements` function to check if there are more elements in the `manifest` hash table. This function returns `FAILURE` if there are no more elements, and `SUCCESS` if there are more elements. The code is then using a `while` loop to iterate over the elements in the `manifest` hash table, and it breaks out of the loop when `FAILURE` is returned.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to a DoS attack because it is not possible to cause the `zend_hash_has_more_elements` function to return `FAILURE` by sending a specially crafted input. The function is designed to return `FAILURE` only when there are no more elements in the hash table, and the code is not vulnerable to a DoS attack because it is not possible to cause the function to return `FAILURE` by sending a specially crafted input.",4035,230,8.843532800674438

The function uses a BFS algorithm to traverse the grid, and it maintains a lookup table to keep track of the shortest distance from the starting point to each cell in the grid. The function also uses a priority queue to keep track of the cells that need to be visited in the next iteration.

The function does not have any vulnerabilities that can cause a DoS attack. The only potential vulnerability is if the input grid is too large, which can cause the function to run out of memory. However, this is not a DoS vulnerability, but rather a resource exhaustion vulnerability.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to craft a specially crafted PDF file that causes the `pdf_run_xobject` function to repeatedly throw exceptions. This would cause the `fz_begin_mask` function to repeatedly call `fz_drop_colorspace` with a null pointer, leading to a crash.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to modify the file to have a large number of sparse regions, each with a large offset. This would cause the `lseek_or_error` function to repeatedly seek to the end of the file, which would eventually cause a read error. The attacker could then use this error to cause the program to enter an infinite loop, which would consume all available resources and lead to a denial-of-service.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gmallocn` function, which allocates memory for an array of `n` elements of size `m`. In this case, the `n` value is derived from the `colorMap->getNumPixelComps()` function, which can return a large value. The `m` value is derived from the `colorMap->getBits()` function, which can also return a large value.

The `gmallocn` function uses the `gmalloc` function to allocate memory for the array, and the `gmalloc` function uses the `grealloc` function to reallocate memory. The `grealloc` function uses the `gfree` function to free the memory, and the `gfree` function uses the `gmalloc` function to allocate memory again.

This creates a loop where the memory is allocated, reallocated, and freed repeatedly, leading to a stack overflow. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PDF file with a large value for `n` and `m`, causing the stack to overflow and leading to a denial of service.",3430,300,11.933346271514893

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `gets` function, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input string is too long. The `gets` function does not perform any bounds checking, and it does not provide any mechanism for the user to specify the maximum length of the input string. This means that an attacker can potentially overflow the buffer by providing a long input string, leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a specially crafted PDF file that contains a malicious string that is longer than the buffer size. The attacker could then use this string to overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.

It is important to note that this vulnerability is not specific to the `gets` function, but rather a general issue with any function that does not perform bounds checking.

This can be exploited by sending a specially crafted PDF file that contains a large amount of data in the `maskImgStr` stream, causing the buffer to overflow and leading to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the `maskBuffer` buffer is large enough to hold the data from the `maskImgStr` stream, and that the `maskBuffer` buffer is properly initialized before being used.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `splashFloor` function, which is used to calculate the index of the line dash pattern. The function takes a floating-point number as input and returns the largest integer less than or equal to that number. However, the function does not check for overflows, which can occur if the input value is too large.

If the input value is too large, the function will return a value that is not the largest integer less than or equal to the input value, but rather a value that is too large to fit in the integer range. This can cause the `lineDashStartIdx` variable to take on a value that is not within the bounds of the `state->lineDash` array, leading to a buffer overflow.

The buffer overflow can cause the program to write to memory locations that it is not authorized to access, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute malicious code with elevated privileges, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro, which reads the next 32-bit value from the input buffer without performing any bounds checking. This allows an attacker to overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a specially crafted input that causes the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro to read beyond the end of the input buffer. This can be done by providing a large value for the `length` parameter, which is used as the size of the input buffer. If the `length` value is too large, the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro will read beyond the end of the buffer, leading to an overflow.

The vulnerability can be mitigated by properly validating the input buffer size and ensuring that the `length` parameter is not too large. Additionally, the `TT_NEXT_ULONG` macro should be replaced with a safer alternative that performs bounds checking.",2691,271,10.339972496032715
