177736,Bypass,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-8467. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function does not properly check for administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. This allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the existence of a domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC, a similar issue to CVE-2015-2535.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not check for the presence of the required rights on the Domain object, which are necessary to create machine accounts. This allows an attacker to create machine accounts with the desired privileges, bypassing the intended access restrictions.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the domain with both a Samba DC and a Windows DC. The attacker can then use this vulnerability to bypass intended access restrictions and create machine accounts with the desired privileges. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or system resources.",3036,252,9.97835898399353

The code is using the `estrdup` function to allocate memory for the `strbuf` variable, which is a buffer that is used to store the time string. The `estrdup` function is a wrapper around the `malloc` function, which allocates memory from the heap. The memory allocated by `estrdup` is not freed until the `strbuf` variable goes out of scope, which is when the function returns. Therefore, there is no memory leak in this code.

Furthermore, the code is not using any deprecated or insecure functions, such as `gets`, `scanf`, or `strcpy`. It is using the `snprintf` function to format the time string, which is a safer alternative to `sprintf`.

The code is also not using any improper error handling mechanisms, such as ignoring or mishandling exceptions or errors. It is using the `php_error_docref` function to log errors, which is a safer alternative to `printf`.

Instead, it only checks if the size of the session data is greater than the size of the buffer provided by the caller. If the size is greater, it returns an error code indicating that the buffer is too small.

However, the function does perform a memory copy of the session data, which could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the session data is greater than the size of the buffer provided by the caller. To mitigate this, the caller should ensure that the buffer provided by the caller is large enough to hold the session data.",1748,172,6.395462274551392

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `fz_try` macro, which catches all exceptions and ignores them. This allows an attacker to intentionally cause an exception to be thrown, which would otherwise be caught and handled by the `fz_catch` block. However, since the `fz_try` block catches all exceptions, the exception is not propagated to the `fz_catch` block, and the program continues to execute without any error handling.

This allows an attacker to potentially cause a denial of service (DoS) by intentionally causing an exception to be thrown, which would otherwise be caught and handled by the `fz_catch` block. The attacker can potentially cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code, depending on the specific exception that is thrown.

To fix this vulnerability, the `fz_try` macro should be modified to only catch specific exceptions that are expected to be thrown, and not catch all exceptions.

The ImageStream class does not properly check the size of the input stream, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input stream contains a crafted PDF file. This can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly check the size of the input stream before creating the ImageStream object. This can be done by using the ImageStream::getSize() method to get the size of the input stream and then checking if the size is greater than the maximum allowed size. If the size is greater than the maximum allowed size, the code should throw an exception or return an error.

Specifically, the function uses the `vector<vector<int>>` data structure, which can cause an integer overflow if the input data is too large.

The vulnerability is caused by the line `dist[nr][nc] = dist[r][c] + 1;`, which adds 1 to the value of `dist[r][c]`. If the value of `dist[r][c]` is close to the maximum value of an integer, then adding 1 to it can cause an integer overflow. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the function returning incorrect results or crashing.

To fix the vulnerability, the code should perform bounds checking on the input data to ensure that it is within the valid range. This can be done by using the `std::vector` class's `at()` method, which throws an exception if the index is out of bounds.

The `talloc_strdup` function is a memory allocation function that allocates memory for a string and copies the contents of the string into the new memory block. It does not modify the original string. Therefore, there is no vulnerability related to buffer overflow or use after free.

The code is also using the `strchr_m` function to find the position of the first occurrence of the character '\\' in the `sharename` string. If the character is not found, the function returns a null pointer. The code then checks if the pointer is null and returns an error if it is. Therefore, there is no vulnerability related to null pointer dereference.

177855,Bypass,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a Bypass vulnerability. The CVE-ID is CVE-2015-5252. The CWE-ID is CWE-264.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code allows a symlink to point outside of a share, which can bypass intended file-access restrictions. This can be exploited by creating a symlink that points to a file outside of the share, and then accessing the symlink. The code does not properly check the validity of the symlink, which allows an attacker to access files outside of the share.

This vulnerability is similar to the one described in CVE-2015-5252, which affects Samba 3.x and 4.x before 4.1.22, 4.2.x before 4.2.7, and 4.3.x before 4.3.3.",3686,219,8.812183618545532
177856,nan,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `do_ed_script` takes in a `char const *inname` and a `char const *outname` as input, and then uses the `strcpy` function to copy the contents of `inname` into a buffer. However, the buffer is not properly sized, and the `strcpy` function can potentially overflow the buffer, leading to a security vulnerability.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `strcpy` function does not perform any bounds checking on the input string, and it simply copies the contents of the input string into the buffer without any validation. This means that if the input string is longer than the buffer, the `strcpy` function will write beyond the end of the buffer, potentially overwriting other parts of the program's memory.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could provide a specially crafted input string that is longer than the buffer, causing the `strcpy` function to write beyond the end of the buffer. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, as the attacker could potentially write malicious code into the program's memory.
