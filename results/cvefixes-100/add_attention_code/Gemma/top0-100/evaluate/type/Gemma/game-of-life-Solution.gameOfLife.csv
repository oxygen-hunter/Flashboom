One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue.

The code uses a `ClientReplicationStreamProtocol` to establish a connection between the worker and master HS. This protocol is vulnerable to a type of attack known as ""**Remote Code Execution (RCE)**"" because it allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. 

Here's why:

* **Unvalidated Input:** The code accepts user-controlled input in the form of a URL. This input is not validated or sanitized, making it possible for an attacker to craft a malicious URL that could execute arbitrary code on the server.
* **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not sanitize or validate the input before using it in the `ClientReplicationStreamProtocol`. This means that any malicious input could be executed.

An http parameter may contain a URL value and could cause the web application to redirect the request to the specified URL. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials.

The code uses a function `gameOfLife` that manipulates a 2D array (`board`) to simulate the Game of Life. This function is vulnerable to a classic buffer overflow attack. 

Here's why:

* **Unbounded Input:** The `gameOfLife` function doesn't have any input validation to ensure the size of the `board` array is within acceptable limits. 
* **Potential Overflow:**  If the `board` array is larger than the allocated memory, the function could write beyond the allocated memory, leading to a buffer overflow. 
* **Impact:** A buffer overflow can lead to code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.

Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled URL Expansion:** The `add_security_headers` function dynamically adds trusted hosts to the `Content-Security-Policy` header. This allows attackers to craft requests that include URLs to potentially unauthorized or internal systems.
* **Potential for Arbitrary Requests:**  The code allows for the inclusion of arbitrary URLs in the `Content-Security-Policy` header. This opens the door for attackers to send requests to internal systems or services that the server is not authorized to access. 
* **Exploiting `config.config_trustedhosts`:** The `config.config_trustedhosts` variable is used to define trusted hosts. If an attacker can manipulate this variable, they can inject malicious URLs that the server will attempt to access. 


**Example Attack:**

An attacker could craft a request like this:

```
https://example.com/api/data?endpoint=web.read_book&url=http://internal.example.com/data/secret.txt
```

The server would then attempt to access the `http://internal.example.com/data/secret.txt` URL, potentially exposing sensitive information. 


**Mitigation:**

* **Strict Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided input, especially URLs and other data that might be used","

    * **Target Internal Systems:**  The code retrieves data from the database, which could be used to access internal systems or resources.
    * **Bypass Security:**  The code doesn't adequately validate or sanitize user input, making it possible to construct URLs that bypass security measures.

* **Potential for Port Scanning:**  The code's use of `format_date` and `format='medium'` could be exploited to construct URLs that target specific ports.


**Important:**  This vulnerability is a serious security risk. It allows attackers to potentially gain unauthorized access to internal systems and data.

CWE description:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

Extended description:
By providing URLs to unexpected hosts or ports, attackers can make it appear that the server is sending the request, possibly bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly. The server can be used as a proxy to conduct port scanning of hosts in internal networks, use other URLs such as that can access documents on the system (using file://), or use other protocols such as gopher:// or tftp://, which may provide greater control over the contents of requests.

The code is vulnerable to a potential SSRF attack. 

Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled URL Handling:** The code fetches data from URLs based on the `data` parameter. This means an attacker could provide a malicious URL that targets an internal service or resource.
* **Potential for Arbitrary Requests:** The code doesn't validate or sanitize the `data` parameter. An attacker could manipulate the `data` parameter to include arbitrary URLs, potentially leading to the server making requests to unintended destinations.
* **Impact of SSRF:**  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:
    * **Access Internal Systems:**  The server could be tricked into making requests to internal systems or services, potentially gaining unauthorized access.
    * **Execute Commands:**  An attacker could craft a malicious URL that triggers the server to execute commands on the target system. 
    * **Exfiltrate Data:**  The server could be used to exfiltrate sensitive data from the target system. 


**Mitigation:**

* **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided data, especially URLs.
* **URL Whitelisting:**  Restrict the allowed URLs to a predefined whitelist.
* **Output Encoding:**  Encode all output to prevent malicious code injection.
* **Security Testing:**  Conduct regular security testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

The code is vulnerable to a potential SSRF attack. 

Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled URL Handling:** The code uses `request.args.get('query')` to retrieve a query from the URL. This query is then used to construct a search request.
* **Potential for Unintended Destinations:** The code doesn't adequately validate or sanitize the query. An attacker could craft a query that leads to an unintended destination, potentially a server within the same network.
* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  The code could be exploited to make requests to internal systems or services that are not intended to be accessed from the web server. 


**Mitigation:**

* **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided data, especially queries.
* **URL Whitelisting:**  Restrict the allowed URLs to known and trusted sources.
* **Output Encoding:**  Encode user-supplied data before displaying it to prevent malicious code injection. 
* **Security Testing:**  Regularly test for SSRF vulnerabilities.

The code is vulnerable to a potential SSRF attack. 

Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled URL Requests:** The code fetches data from a database based on the `order` parameter. This parameter can be manipulated by an attacker to request data from unintended or unauthorized locations.
* **Potential for Arbitrary URLs:** The code uses `func.random()` and `func.count(ub.Downloads.book_id).desc()` to determine the order of books.

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The code is vulnerable to a potential **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** attack. 

Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled URL Execution:** The code directly executes arbitrary URLs from the `content.id` parameter. This means an attacker could provide a malicious URL that targets internal systems or services.
* **Potential for Data Exfiltration:**  The code deletes data from various database tables, including `KoboReadingState`. An attacker could craft a malicious URL to access sensitive data or manipulate the database.
* **Bypass Access Controls:** The code's reliance on user-provided IDs for deletion could be exploited to bypass security measures.

CWE description:
The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Extended description:

            Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:
            
               Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)
               Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and
               Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)
            
            When any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.
            There are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:
               
                  Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.
                  Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.

CWE description:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

Extended description:

            Improper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.
            Most products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, ""GET /index.html HTTP/1.1"" is a structured message containing a command (""GET"") with a single argument (""/index.html"") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (""HTTP/1.1"").
            If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

[{'lang': 'en', 'value': 'This affects the package bikeshed before 3.0.0. This can occur when an untrusted source file containing Inline Tag Command metadata is processed. When an arbitrary OS command is executed, the command output would be included in the HTML output.'}]

CWE description:
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

The code is vulnerable to CWE-352 because it does not verify the validity of the request body.  Specifically, the code uses `json.loads` to parse the request body, but it does not check the content type of the request. This means that an attacker could send a request with a malicious payload that is not JSON, and the code will still attempt to parse it as JSON.

FastAPI versions lower than 0.65.2 that used cookies for authentication in path operations that received JSON payloads sent by browsers were vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. In versions lower than 0.65.2, FastAPI would try to read the request payload as JSON even if the content-type header sent was not set to application/json or a compatible JSON media type (e.g. application/geo+json). A request with a content type of text/plain containing JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data would be extracted. Requests with content type text/plain are exempt from CORS preflights, for being considered Simple requests. The browser will execute them right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application. This is fixed in FastAPI 0.65.2. The request data is now parsed as JSON only if the content-type header is application/json or another JSON compatible media type like application/geo+json.

[{'lang': 'en', 'value': 'In Shuup, versions 1.6.0 through 2.10.8 are vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) that allows execution of arbitrary javascript code on a victim browser. This vulnerability exists due to the error page contents not escaped.'}]

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The code is vulnerable to SSRF because it's using the `helper.convert_book_format` function to convert book formats. This function could be designed to send requests to external servers, potentially including URLs that are not intended for the application. 

Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled URL Execution:** The code doesn't validate or sanitize the URLs passed to `helper.convert_book_format`. This means an attacker could provide a malicious URL that could be used to access internal systems or resources.
* **Potential for Unauthorized Access:**  An attacker could craft a URL that leads to a server or resource they shouldn't have access to. 
* **Unintended Functionality:** The code doesn't explicitly check for the validity of the URLs or the expected response from the external server. 


This makes the code susceptible to SSRF attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the request to access resources they shouldn't.

The code is vulnerable to a potential SSRF attack. 

Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled URL Handling:** The code uses `helper.get_valid_filename` to generate file paths. This function could potentially be manipulated to include URLs that are not intended to be accessed.
* **Potential for URL Execution:**  The code then uses these paths to interact with the database. This means an attacker could craft a URL that, when executed, could potentially access sensitive data or even execute commands on the server. 
* **CWE-918 Exploitation:** The code's reliance on external URLs for file paths and database interactions makes it susceptible to the exploitation of the CVE-2022-0939 vulnerability.
