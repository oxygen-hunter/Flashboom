The code is vulnerable to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack. 

Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled URL Generation:** The code uses `helper.get_valid_filename` to generate filenames. This function could potentially be manipulated to generate URLs to external services.
* **Potential for URL Execution:**  The code then uses these generated URLs to interact with external services. This is a classic SSRF vulnerability. 
* **Example Attack:** An attacker could craft a URL like `http://example.com/some/path/to/execute/something` and pass it to the `create_book_on_upload` function. The code would then attempt to execute the command on the server. 


Let me know if you'd like a more detailed explanation of how this vulnerability works.
