The code is vulnerable to a potential SSRF attack. 

Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled URL Resolution:** The code uses `helper.get_valid_filename` to generate paths. This function could potentially be manipulated to resolve URLs to arbitrary hosts.
* **Potential for Arbitrary Requests:**  The code constructs paths using `os.path.join` and `replace('\\', '/')`. This could be exploited to construct paths to internal network resources or external services.
* **Unvalidated Input:** The code doesn't validate or sanitize user input, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
