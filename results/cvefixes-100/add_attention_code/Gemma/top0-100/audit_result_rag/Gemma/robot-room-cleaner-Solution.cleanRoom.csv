The code uses a `ClientReplicationStreamProtocol` to establish a TCP connection between the worker and master HS. This protocol is vulnerable to a **TCP SYN Flood attack**. 

Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled Connection Attempts:** The code doesn't limit the number of connections a worker can establish. 
* **Lack of Connection Management:** There's no mechanism to gracefully handle connection attempts or limit the number of connections.
* **Potential for Denial of Service:** A malicious actor could flood the worker with connection requests, overwhelming the server and potentially causing a denial of service.

The code is vulnerable to a potential SSRF attack. 

Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled URL Resolution:** The code uses `helper.get_valid_filename` to generate paths. This function could potentially be manipulated to resolve URLs to internal systems or services.
* **Potential for Arbitrary Requests:**  The code constructs paths based on user input. An attacker could provide malicious URLs that would be interpreted as requests to internal systems or services.
* **Impact:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to internal systems or services, potentially leading to data theft or system compromise.
