The code uses `get_cell` to render the data. This function could be vulnerable to XSS if the data is not properly sanitized.

The code is vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)). 

Here's why:

* **URL Resolution:** The code uses `db_session.query(db_object).filter(db_filter == add_element).first()` to retrieve objects based on a filter. This could potentially be used to resolve URLs.
* **Uncontrolled Input:** The code doesn't sanitize or validate the `add_elements` input. An attacker could provide malicious URLs or other requests that could be resolved by the database. 
* **Potential for Unauthorized Access:**  An attacker could craft malicious `add_elements` that would lead to the database accessing resources it shouldn't. 


Let me know if you'd like a more detailed explanation of how this vulnerability could be exploited.

98,CWE-918,"YES
The code is vulnerable to a SSRF attack because it retrieves the contents of a URL from an upstream component.  The attacker can provide a malicious URL that points to an internal network resource, potentially allowing them to access sensitive data or execute commands on the server.

The code is vulnerable to SSRF because it retrieves the contents of a URL from an upstream component.  The code does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

100,CWE-918,"YES
The code is vulnerable to a potential SSRF attack. 

Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled URL Resolution:** The code uses `helper.get_valid_filename` to generate paths. This function could potentially be manipulated to resolve URLs to external resources.
* **Potential for Arbitrary Requests:**  The code constructs paths based on user input. An attacker could craft malicious input to generate paths that would lead to unintended actions on the server. 
* **Unrestricted Access:** The code doesn't adequately validate or sanitize user input, making it possible for an attacker to construct URLs that could lead to unauthorized access to internal systems or resources.
