The code is vulnerable to a classic web application attack called a **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attack.

* **Redirect to Malicious Site:**  The code redirects requests to the `worker_app` parameter. If the `worker_app` parameter is a malicious URL, the code could redirect the user to a malicious site.

The code is vulnerable to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.
