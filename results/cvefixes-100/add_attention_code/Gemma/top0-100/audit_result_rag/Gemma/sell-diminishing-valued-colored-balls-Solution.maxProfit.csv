The code is vulnerable to a potential SSRF attack. 

Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled URL Resolution:** The code uses `helper.get_valid_filename` to generate paths. This function could potentially be manipulated to resolve URLs to arbitrary hosts.
* **Potential for Arbitrary Requests:**  The code constructs paths based on the `db_author.name` and `title`. An attacker could craft malicious URLs that would be interpreted as valid paths.
* **Impact:** An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to:
    * **Access Internal Systems:**  By crafting URLs to internal systems, an attacker could gain unauthorized access.
    * **Execute Commands:**  An attacker could potentially execute commands on the server by manipulating the paths.
