* **Use a Secure Framework:**  Consider using a framework that provides built-in security measures to prevent SSRF. 
* **Implement Access Control:**  Implement strict access control mechanisms to limit what resources are accessible.

The code uses `get_cell` to render the data. This function could be vulnerable to XSS if the data is not properly sanitized.

96,CWE-918,"YES
The code is vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)). 

Here's why:

* **URL Resolution:** The code uses `db_session.query(db_object).filter(db_filter == add_element).first()` to retrieve objects based on a filter. This could potentially be used to resolve URLs.
* **Uncontrolled Input:** The code doesn't sanitize or validate the `add_elements` input. An attacker could provide malicious URLs or other requests that could be resolved by the database.
* **Potential for Access:**  The code could be used to access resources outside the intended scope, potentially leading to unauthorized access. 


Let me know if you'd like a more detailed explanation of how this vulnerability could be exploited.

The code is vulnerable to SSRF because it retrieves the contents of a URL from an upstream component.  The code does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

The code is vulnerable to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack. 

Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled URL Retrieval:** The code uses `helper.get_valid_filename` to generate paths. This function could potentially be manipulated to include arbitrary URLs.
* **Potential for URL Injection:** An attacker could craft a malicious URL that, when passed to `helper.get_valid_filename`, could lead to the server making requests to unintended or unauthorized locations. 
* **SSRF Exploitation:**  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to make the server request data from internal systems or services it shouldn't access.
