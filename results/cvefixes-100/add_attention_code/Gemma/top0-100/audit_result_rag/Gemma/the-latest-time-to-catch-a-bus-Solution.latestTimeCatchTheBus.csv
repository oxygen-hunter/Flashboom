The code uses `force_text(reason)` to sanitize the `reason` string. However, it does not properly escape the `reason` string before it is used in the `json.dumps` call. This means that an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the `reason` string, which could then be executed by the browser.

The code is vulnerable to a potential SSRF attack. 

Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled URL Resolution:** The code uses `helper.get_valid_filename` to generate file paths. This function could potentially be manipulated to resolve URLs to arbitrary hosts.
* **Potential for Arbitrary Requests:**  The code constructs paths using `os.path.join` and `replace('\\', '/')`. This could be exploited to construct paths to internal systems or services.
* **Unrestricted Access:** The code interacts with the database and potentially other systems. This opens the possibility for an attacker to manipulate the database or other systems through the provided URLs.
