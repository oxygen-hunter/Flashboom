The code uses a function `daysBetweenDates` that calculates the difference in days between two dates. This function is vulnerable to a potential integer overflow. 

Here's why:

* **Integer Overflow:** The function uses a formula that involves integer division and addition. If the difference between the two dates is large enough, the result of the calculation could exceed the maximum value an integer can hold. 
* **Potential for Incorrect Results:** This overflow could lead to incorrect results, potentially causing the code to behave unexpectedly.

98,CWE-918,"YES
The code is vulnerable to SSRF because it retrieves the contents of a URL from an upstream component.  The code does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

100,CWE-918,"YES
The code is vulnerable to a potential SSRF attack. 

Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled URL Resolution:** The code uses `helper.get_valid_filename` to generate paths. This function could potentially be manipulated to include URLs that are not intended.
* **Potential for Arbitrary Requests:**  The code constructs paths using `os.path.join` and `replace('\\', '/')`. This could be exploited to construct paths to arbitrary locations on the server, potentially leading to a request to a different server than intended. 
* **Unvalidated Input:** The code does not validate or sanitize user input, which could lead to the inclusion of malicious URLs. 


Let me know if you'd like a more detailed explanation of how this vulnerability could be exploited.
