",844,62,3.6664974689483643
3,CWE-601,"YES
The code uses a function `countEven` that takes an integer `num` as input. The function then iterates through numbers from 1 to `num` and checks if the remainder of each number divided by 10 is 0. If it is, the function adds 1 to the result. The function then returns the sum of all the numbers that satisfy the condition. 

This function is vulnerable to a **denial of service (DoS)** attack. 

**Explanation:**

* **Integer Overflow:** The function uses `x //= 10` to remove the last digit of `x`. This can lead to integer overflow if `x` is large enough. 
* **Potential for Infinite Loop:** The function uses a `while` loop that continues as long as `x` is not zero. This loop could potentially run indefinitely if `x` is large enough. 
* **Resource Exhaustion:** The function could potentially consume a large amount of resources, such as memory or CPU time, if it is executed for a long time. 

**Mitigation:**

* **Input Validation:** Validate the input `num` to ensure it is within a reasonable range.
* **Error Handling:** Implement error handling to prevent the function from crashing if `x` is too large.
* **Resource Management:** Limit the execution time of the function to prevent resource exhaustion.

The code is vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)). 

Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled URL Resolution:** The `adv_search_serie` function uses `db.Books.series.any` to filter books based on series IDs. This means the function can potentially resolve URLs to external hosts or services.
* **Potential for SSRF:**  An attacker could provide a series ID that points to an internal service or a non-existent URL. The function would then attempt to resolve that URL, potentially leading to a data leak or unauthorized access. 
* **No Input Validation:** The code doesn't validate the input `include_series_inputs` or `exclude_series_inputs`. This makes it possible for an attacker to provide malicious series IDs that could trigger unintended actions.

* **Potential for Abuse:** This vulnerability could be exploited by attackers to delete user accounts, potentially leading to data loss or other security breaches.

The code uses `exec(code, globals())` to execute the code retrieved from `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile`. This is a classic example of CWE-78, OS command injection.  The code is vulnerable because it executes arbitrary code without proper sanitization or validation of the input.

The code is vulnerable to CWE-352 because it does not properly validate the request body.  Specifically, the code is vulnerable to a JSON decoding attack. 

Here's why:

* **Unvalidated Request Body:** The code accepts a JSON payload without verifying its validity.
* **JSON Decoding Vulnerability:** The code uses `json.loads` to decode the JSON data. If the JSON data is not valid, it will cause a `json.decoder.JSONDecodeError`. 
* **Exploitation:** An attacker could craft a malicious JSON payload that causes the `json.loads` function to fail, leading to a potential security vulnerability.

96,CWE-918,"YES
The code is vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)). 

Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled URL Resolution:** The code uses `db_session.query(db_object).filter(db_filter == add_element).first()` to retrieve objects based on a `db_filter` value. This means the code is essentially executing arbitrary queries against the database.
* **Potential for Malicious URLs:**  An attacker could provide a malicious URL as `add_element` that would lead to the server executing unintended commands or accessing sensitive data. 
* **SSRF Exploitation:**  The code doesn't validate or sanitize the `add_element` input, making it susceptible to SSRF attacks.

The code is vulnerable to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack. 

Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled URL Generation:** The code constructs paths using `os.path.join` and `helper.get_valid_filename`.  This means an attacker could potentially provide a malicious URL as part of the `meta.file_path` input.
* **Potential for URL Execution:**  The code then uses this URL to interact with the database.  An attacker could craft a URL that:
    *  Executes a command on the server (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/some_command`).
    *  Accesses sensitive data on the server.
* **Exploiting the `helper.get_valid_filename` function:** The function doesn't seem to have any checks to prevent the user from providing invalid or malicious filenames.
