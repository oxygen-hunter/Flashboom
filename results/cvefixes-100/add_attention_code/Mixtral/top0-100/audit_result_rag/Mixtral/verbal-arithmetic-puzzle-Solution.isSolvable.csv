The code only performs data validation and updates the database. The `redirect` function in the code is not used to redirect to a user-controlled URL.,1333,60,2.469876289367676
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly validate or check the tenant name or ID during authentication, allowing an attacker to potentially authenticate with a different tenant than intended, bypassing intended authorization restrictions.",3583,56,2.7202606201171875
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not involve constructing or executing OS commands using externally-influenced input. Instead, it defines a recursive function for solving a word problem and does not interact with the operating system.",1334,59,2.4217100143432617
83,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not perform any file operations and is not vulnerable to CWE-22. It is a recursive function for solving a word problem.,966,35,1.517805576324463
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE. It is a separate function for solving a Sudoku puzzle.,1639,34,1.5322303771972656
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input or data from an untrusted source in a way that could lead to spoofing attacks. Instead, it is validating JSON data and performing a Sudoku-like backtracking algorithm.",999,66,2.628791332244873
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for the function `isSolvable` does not contain an infinite loop or a condition that cannot be reached. It is a recursive function used for solving a Sudoku puzzle, and it terminates when the recursion depth reaches the base case or when the given conditions are not met.",1210,65,2.620518684387207
87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that is inconsistent with how the ultimate destination entities will process them. Instead, it simply constructs and returns a dictionary with video metadata.",1994,79,3.269869565963745
88,CWE-79," The given code for the function `_get_unauth_response` is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability exists due to the error message being constructed from user-controllable input (reason) and being returned to the user without proper escaping.

An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code in the reason parameter, which will be reflected back in the error message and executed by the user's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as stealing sensitive information, performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user, or even taking control of the user's machine.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to CWE-79 (Cross-Site Scripting) and the described CVE-2021-25963 vulnerability. To mitigate this issue, the error message should be properly escaped before being returned to the user. This can be done using a library like Django's `json.dumps()` with the `ensure_ascii=True` option or by using a template engine to escape the input.",2264,236,9.350483655929565
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations using user-controlled input, and it does not construct file paths. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or any other file-related vulnerabilities.",1015,53,2.2483575344085693
90,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations and is not related to the described vulnerability (CWE-22). It is a recursive function for solving a word problem, unrelated to the backup_download function.",1008,48,1.9532864093780518
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve sending user-controlled data to an external source without proper validation. Instead, it is a recursive function for solving a word problem using backtracking algorithm.",1009,57,2.2896952629089355
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it is a recursive function for solving a word problem.",1061,54,2.182305335998535

94,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in a way that could lead to server-side request forgery. Instead, it is a recursive function for solving a word problem using backtracking algorithm.",1055,63,2.5677826404571533
95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users. Instead, it is validating expected values against the output of a database query.",2643,58,2.6067678928375244
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs.
