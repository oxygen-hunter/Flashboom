This means that any user can call the function and delete any other user, including admin users, as long as there is at least one admin user with a different id in the database. This is a clear violation of the principle of least privilege and can lead to unintended consequences.",2207,169,6.725096702575684
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve making a request to an untrusted source based on user input. Instead, it makes a request to a Dropbox link obtained from the recipe object, which is not user-supplied data.",906,64,2.5601611137390137
78,CWE-116," NO. The given code does not construct a shell command from user-supplied data directly, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-116. Instead, it constructs a list of command-line arguments and appends them to a pre-existing list, which is then used to construct the final command using string concatenation. This approach does not allow for arbitrary injection of shell commands.",1625,83,3.4061837196350098
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it is a function for calculating the difference between two strings as integers.",1139,53,2.23515248298645
80,CWE-601, NO. The given code does not contain any functionality that would allow for an attacker to redirect the request to a malicious site. The code only performs some data manipulation and rendering.,1198,39,1.650634765625
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration and allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining or leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account or a account with a changed password.",3448,67,3.0674688816070557
82,CWE-78," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the use of `exec()` function which executes the given code as a part of the current Python script. Since the code being executed is retrieved from an untrusted source (config.retrieveBoilerplateFile), it can potentially contain arbitrary OS commands which will be executed in the context of the current Python process. This can lead to OS command injection and potential security vulnerabilities.",1199,96,3.788419246673584
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve handling file paths or external input in a way that could allow an attacker to traverse outside of the intended directory. Instead, it defines a function `load` that retrieves and executes a boilerplate file, and a separate function `count` that performs a dynamic programming calculation using string inputs and integer limits.",831,95,3.7537269592285156
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE-2021-32677 and CWE-352. It is a function definition for a different purpose.,1504,47,1.9984257221221924
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it does not involve any unsanitized user input or authentication schemes. Instead, it is a separate function for calculating the difference between two strings using dynamic programming.",864,54,2.1639111042022705
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for the `data_received` function does not contain an infinite loop, as it has an exit condition (the `while self._buffer` condition) that can be reached. The `count` function, on the other hand, is not related to the vulnerability discussed in the initial code snippet and does not contain an infinite loop either.",1075,77,3.0653061866760254
87,CWE-444," The given code for `_parse_video` function does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities, and it does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that is inconsistent with how the messages will be processed by the ultimate destination. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",1859,83,3.4086806774139404
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation and output encoding in the following line:

login_url = force_str(reverse(""shuup_admin:login"") + ""?"" + error_params)

This line constructs a URL by concatenating the result of reverse() and error_params without any validation or encoding. If error_params contains malicious JavaScript code, it will be executed when the URL is visited in a web browser, leading to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.",2129,121,5.012312889099121
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations using user-controlled input, and hence it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) attacks.",880,38,1.5736610889434814
90,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not involve file operations and is not related to the described vulnerability (CWE-22). It is a separate function for calculating an integer value based on two strings and some constraints.,873,46,1.875108242034912
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve sending user-controlled data to an external server or making network requests without proper validation. Instead, it is a function for calculating an integer value based on two strings and some constraints.",874,62,2.4847424030303955
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded path to the'static' directory within the application's 'libs/flask_restx' directory.",926,72,2.840909719467163
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it is a function for calculating the difference between two strings as integers, using dynamic programming.",919,62,2.5178253650665283
94,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in a way that could lead to SSRF attacks. Instead, it is a function for calculating an integer value based on two string inputs and some constraints.",920,63,2.5657122135162354
95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users. Instead, it is a function for testing the rendering of custom fields in a table, and the input is hardcoded and not user-supplied.",2508,73,3.1381676197052
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the CWE-918 description provided. The code does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs, which are common vectors for SSRF vulnerabilities. Instead, it only deals with internal database queries and object manipulation.",1529,79,3.3032588958740234
97,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the CWE-918 description provided.

98,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it processes form data and calls a local helper function to perform book format conversion.",1397,59,2.43446946144104
