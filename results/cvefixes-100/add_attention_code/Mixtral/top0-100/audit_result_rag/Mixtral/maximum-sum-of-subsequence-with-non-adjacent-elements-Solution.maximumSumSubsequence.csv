80,CWE-601," NO. The given code does not contain any open redirect vulnerability as described in CWE-601. The code is not redirecting to a user-controlled input, instead it is rendering a template and redirecting to a predefined URL based on the 'next' parameter.",1790,60,2.5318996906280518
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration, allowing remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining. The code does not check the validity or expiration of the provided tokens before creating new ones.",4040,68,3.186292886734009
82,CWE-78," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability occurs in the `load` function where it executes the retrieved code using `exec(code, globals())`. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands or Python code, leading to CWE-78 OS Command Injection vulnerability.",1791,67,2.794398069381714
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not use external input to construct a file pathname and does not involve any file operations, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or CVE-2021-23423.",1423,57,2.3683102130889893
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE descriptions. It is a separate piece of code that implements a segment tree data structure.,2096,38,1.7551422119140625
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input directly and is instead using a pre-validated JSON object. The vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE involves unsanitized UUIDs being passed by a rogue agent, but the code provided does not involve UUIDs or agent data validation in the same way as the vulnerable code in the CVE description.",1456,94,3.765592336654663
86,CWE-835, NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-835 as it does not contain an infinite loop. The code is implementing a segment tree data structure and is not related to the vulnerability described in the initial code snippet.,1667,50,2.148700475692749
87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to act as an intermediary HTTP agent and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that could allow for smuggling attacks as described in the CWE-444 description. Instead, it is processing a dictionary-like object called 'video' and constructing a new dictionary based on its keys and values.",2451,78,3.4384758472442627
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter passed to the _get\_unauth\_response function. The vulnerable line is:

login\_url = force\_str(reverse(""shuup\_admin:login"") + ""?"" + error\_params)

This line constructs a URL with the error message, which is not properly encoded, and is then included in the response sent back to the client. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the error message, which will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the URL.",2721,136,5.566357851028442
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations and does not construct file paths based on user-controlled input, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or CVE-2023-50264.",1472,57,2.374377727508545
90,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not involve file operations and is not related to the described vulnerability (CWE-22). It is a Segment Tree implementation for solving a problem related to queries and subarrays.,1465,46,1.931988000869751
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to receive a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieve the contents of this URL without sufficient validation. Instead, it defines a SegmentTree data structure and performs operations on it using locally defined functions.",1466,52,2.18662691116333
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 as it does not involve constructing a pathname from user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a predefined path to access static files using the Flask send\_file function.",1518,56,2.3668715953826904
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 as it does not involve constructing a file path from user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a Segment Tree data structure for a different purpose.",1511,50,2.1437106132507324
94,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in the same way as the described vulnerability. Instead, it uses a Segment Tree data structure for a problem unrelated to handling user input.",1512,60,2.4813690185546875
95,CWE-79," NO.

The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users. Instead, it is validating expected values against the output of a query, and does not involve any user input being reflected back into the response.",3100,73,3.273256778717041
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CWE-918 description provided. The code does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs, which are common vectors for SSRF vulnerabilities. Instead, it only deals with internal database queries and object manipulation.",2121,79,3.308331251144409
97,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CWE-918 description provided. The code is not making any external HTTP requests or handling any user-supplied URLs, so there is no risk of the server being used as a proxy to access unintended destinations.",2121,76,3.191633701324463
98,CWE-918," The given code for `convert_bookformat` function is not directly related to the `SegmentTree` function provided, and it does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CVE-2022-0939 and CWE-918. The `convert_bookformat` function is checking for valid user input and performing a conversion using a helper function, which does not involve making external requests or handling URLs in an unsafe manner. The `SegmentTree` function is a data structure implementation and does not involve any network requests or external data access. Therefore, it is safe from SSRF vulnerabilities.

However, it's important to note that the provided code snippets are isolated, and the actual vulnerability may depend on the context in which they are used. Always ensure that the libraries and dependencies you use are up-to-date and follow best security practices.",1989,199,7.835445165634155
99,CWE-918," The given code for the function `convert_bookformat` is not directly related to the SegmentTree code you provided, so I cannot evaluate its vulnerability based on the information given. However, I will evaluate the SegmentTree code for potential vulnerabilities related to CWE-918.

The SegmentTree code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or other similar vulnerabilities as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied data in a way that could lead to SSRF. The code only deals with internal data structures and operations.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'. The SegmentTree code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",1989,156,6.195459842681885
100,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it processes local file paths and database operations.",2517,52,2.334836006164551
