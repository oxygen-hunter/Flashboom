1,CWE-918," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the fact that the `url` parameter is not sufficiently validated or sanitized before being passed to the `requests_session.request()` function. An attacker could potentially provide a malicious URL that could lead to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The code does include some checks for private addresses, but these checks do not prevent SSRF attacks. To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the `url` parameter before passing it to `requests_session.request()`. This could be done by using a library or module specifically designed for URL validation and sanitization, such as the `urlparse()` function from the `urllib.parse` module in Python's standard library.",2035,170,6.80079984664917

75,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the CWE-918 description provided. The code is not making any external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs, so there is no risk of unintended or unexpected destinations being accessed. Instead, the code is performing internal database queries and deletions based on predefined conditions.",2321,89,3.832437038421631
76,CWE-284," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper access control checks. In the `_delete_user` function, the code deletes a user and all associated data if the following condition is met:

1. The query returns at least one user with the role of an admin and an id different from the given content's id.
2. The given content's name is not ""Guest"".

However, there is no check to ensure that the user making the call to this function is an admin user. This means that any user can call this function with another user's id and delete that user's data. This is a clear violation of the principle of least privilege and can lead to unintended consequences.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to CWE-284: Improper Access Control.",2463,184,7.364418268203735
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve making HTTP requests to user-supplied URLs. Instead, it only makes requests to Dropbox's API using a hardcoded URL.",1162,54,2.302978992462158
78,CWE-116," NO. The given code does not construct a command from user-supplied data without proper encoding or escaping, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-116. Instead, it constructs a list of command-line arguments and appends them to a pre-existing command string using the 'join' method, which does not involve any shell command execution.",1881,76,3.201875925064087
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs or similar requests.

80,CWE-601, NO. The given Python code does not contain any functionality that would allow for an open redirect vulnerability as described in the CWE-601 description. The code is for a function that calculates the maximum number of ones that can be placed in a matrix of given dimensions and maximum number of ones.,1454,63,2.5945959091186523
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration and allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens or leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account or an account with a changed password. The code does not check the validity or expiration of the tokens being used for authentication.",3704,83,3.7039597034454346
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not involve constructing or executing OS commands using externally-influenced input. Instead, it is a Python function for calculating the maximum number of ones that can be placed in a matrix of given dimensions while ensuring that no tile exceeds a specified maximum number of ones.",1455,76,3.163330078125
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 as it does not involve constructing file paths from external input. Instead, it is a function for calculating the maximum number of ones that can be placed in a matrix with given dimensions and the maximum number of ones allowed.",1087,63,2.532543659210205
84,CWE-352, NO. The given Python code is not related to the web application vulnerability described in the CWE-352. It is a function for calculating the maximum number of ones that can be placed in a matrix with given dimensions and the maximum number of ones per tile.,1760,57,2.4029476642608643
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not have any vulnerability related to CWE-290 or log spoofing. The code is for validating agent data and checking if the exclude list contains valid regular expressions, while the other code is for finding the maximum number of ones in a matrix with given dimensions and max number of ones. They are unrelated to each other and do not have any vulnerability related to CWE-290.",1120,92,3.6239988803863525
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for `data_received` function does not contain an infinite loop or a condition that cannot be reached, as required for CWE-835 vulnerability. The code is parsing incoming data and processing it, and if the data is not complete, it returns without entering an infinite loop. The `maximumNumberOfOnes` function is unrelated to the given vulnerability and is not vulnerable on its own.",1331,93,3.7412240505218506
87,CWE-444," The given code for `_parse_video` function is not directly related to the `maximumNumberOfOnes` function, and it does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 issue described in the provided context. The `_parse_video` function is just parsing a video object and returning a dictionary with some metadata about the video. It does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent and does not forward or modify HTTP requests or responses. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-444.",2115,112,4.584850072860718
88,CWE-79," The given code for the function `_get_unauth_response` is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because the error message passed as the `reason` parameter is not properly escaped before being included in the URL query string.

An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `reason` parameter, which will then be reflected back in the URL and executed by the victim's browser when they visit the error page.

Therefore, the answer is 'YES' and the vulnerability is of Type 1: Reflected XSS.",2385,126,5.121552467346191
89,CWE-22," NO. The given Python code does not involve file operations using user-controlled input, and it does not construct file paths. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or any other file-related vulnerabilities.",1136,54,2.2156879901885986

93,CWE-22," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it calculates and constructs file paths using predefined variables and arithmetic operations.",1175,61,2.5773720741271973
94,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in the same way as the vulnerable code provided in the context. Instead, it is a function for calculating the maximum number of ones that can be placed in a matrix of given dimensions and side length while ensuring that the number of ones does not exceed a specified maximum.",1176,85,3.3715310096740723
95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed in output that is used as a web page served to other users.
