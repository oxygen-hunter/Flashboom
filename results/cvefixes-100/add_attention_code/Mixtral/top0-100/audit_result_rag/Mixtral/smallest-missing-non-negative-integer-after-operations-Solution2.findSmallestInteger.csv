1. There exists an admin user in the system.
2. The user to be deleted is not the 'Guest' user.

However, there is no check to ensure that the user calling the `_delete_user` function is an admin user. This means that any user can call this function and delete other users, including admin users, if there is no admin user present in the system.

Therefore, the code violates the principle of least privilege, as any user can delete other users, which is beyond their authorized scope. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as data loss or unauthorized access to resources.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should ensure that only authorized users, such as admin users, can call the `_delete_user` function. This can be achieved by adding access control checks at the function level, for example, by using decorators or function arguments to ensure that only admin users can call the function.",1979,245,9.572815656661987
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or CWE-918. The code is making a request to a Dropbox link provided by the recipe object, which is not being constructed from user input. Therefore, there is no risk of the server making requests to unexpected hosts or ports.",678,73,3.0064220428466797
78,CWE-116," Based on the given code, the `prepare_plugin_docs_command` function does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-116 (Improper Escaping of Input). The function is constructing a command line argument list and appending it to a list, which is then appended to the command list. There is no evidence that user-supplied data is being directly concatenated into a shell command without proper escaping.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",1397,104,4.121736526489258
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it checks for the presence of a session and adapts the label of a LoginButton based on the session data.",911,61,2.4408793449401855
80,CWE-601, NO. The given code does not contain any functionality that would allow for an attacker to redirect the request to a malicious site. The code only updates the value of a field in a Topic object and returns a redirect to the topic page or the specified 'next' URL.,970,58,2.3297464847564697
81,CWE-264," YES, the code is vulnerable to token chaining attacks as described in CVE-2012-3426 and CWE-264. The code does not properly implement token expiration, allowing remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining.",3220,68,3.066885471343994
82,CWE-78," The given code for the `load` function is vulnerable. The reason is that it executes the retrieved code as Python code using the `exec` function, which can lead to OS command injection if the retrieved code contains malicious commands. The `findSmallestInteger` function is not related to this vulnerability and is not affected.",971,71,2.8522145748138428
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve handling file paths or external input that could be used to traverse outside of a restricted directory. Instead, it defines a function called 'load' that retrieves and executes a boilerplate file, and another function 'findSmallestInteger' that is not related to file handling.",603,88,3.4040489196777344
84,CWE-352," NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-352 as it is not related to handling user requests or parsing JSON data. Instead, it is a function for finding the smallest integer in a list based on a given value.",1276,51,2.160691976547241
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input or data from an untrusted source in an insecure manner. Instead, it is validating JSON data and checking the validity of regular expressions, which are not susceptible to spoofing attacks.",636,68,2.7168214321136475
86,CWE-835," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The reason is that the while loop in the `data_received` function may enter an infinite state if an exception is raised during message parsing. This can be exploited by an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition by sending malformed packets that cause the loop to enter an infinite state, consuming excessive resources.

The `findSmallestInteger` function is not related to the vulnerability in the `data_received` function and is not vulnerable on its own.",847,115,4.535007953643799
87,CWE-444," Yes, the code is vulnerable. The issue is that the `smuggle_url` function call allows for the passing of arbitrary `http_headers` in the request. This could potentially allow an attacker to smuggle malicious headers to the ultimate destination server, leading to unintended behavior or data leakage. The use of the `smuggle_url` function in this context is inconsistent with how the ultimate destination server will interpret the headers, and could result in the attacker being able to bypass security checks or exfiltrate sensitive information.",1631,119,4.733501672744751
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error_params string.

89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input.

90,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a predefined settings.backup.folder and the filename argument to join the path.",645,61,2.472663640975952
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input that is being sent to an external URL or similar resource. Instead, it is a function for downloading a file from a local folder using the send_file function, which is not susceptible to SSRF attacks.",646,75,2.9795079231262207
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing a file path using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded file path to serve static files using Flask's send_file function.",698,65,2.5644853115081787

94,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in the same way as the described vulnerability in the CVE and CWE descriptions. Instead, it is a function for returning a static file using Flask's `send_file` function.",692,72,2.8086912631988525
95,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the use of `mark_safe()` or similar functions to render user-controllable input directly in HTML without proper escaping. The `custom_column_expected` dictionary contains user-controllable input that is later rendered as HTML in the `rendered_value` variable. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code in this input, which would be executed in the victim's browser when they view the page containing the table.",2280,113,4.6359779834747314
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions.

98,CWE-918," The given Python code for the function `convert_bookformat` is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks as it takes user-supplied input (`book_format_from` and `book_format_to`) and uses it to construct a URL that is passed to the `helper.convert_book_format` function. This function appears to be making an external request to a specified directory and format based on the user-supplied input. An attacker could potentially manipulate the URL to point to a malicious server or resource, allowing them to bypass access controls and perform unauthorized actions.

Therefore, the answer is 'YES' and the vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation and insufficient checks on user-supplied data, which can lead to SSRF attacks.",1169,175,6.977880477905273
99,CWE-918," The given Python code for the function `convert_bookformat` is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The vulnerability arises from the way the code retrieves the `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` values directly from the user input without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker can manipulate these values to include malicious URLs, which will be fetched by the server and potentially executed with the privileges of the application.

The `findSmallestInteger` function is not related to the vulnerability in the `convert_bookformat` function and is not vulnerable on its own.",1169,139,5.499408006668091
