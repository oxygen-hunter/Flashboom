39,CWE-918," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The vulnerability arises from the way the code constructs SQL queries based on user input. An attacker can manipulate the input to include malicious URLs, which the application will then attempt to access on behalf of the user. This can potentially bypass access controls and allow the attacker to access internal resources or perform other unintended actions.

The specific issue is that the code does not sufficiently validate or sanitize user input when constructing SQL queries. It relies on user-supplied values to determine the conditions of the queries, without checking if those values are valid or safe. This can lead to SQL injection and SSRF vulnerabilities.

In the given code, the user input is used to filter the query results based on various conditions, such as author name, book title, publisher, and custom columns. An attacker can manipulate these inputs to include malicious URLs, which will be executed by the application. For example, they could provide a URL in the 'author_name' field that points to an internal resource, and the application would attempt to access that resource on behalf of the user.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize user input before using it to construct SQL queries. This can be done using various techniques, such as input validation libraries, parameterized queries, or output",4541,301,12.137012958526611

76,CWE-284," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper access control checks. In the function `_delete_user`, an admin user is deleting all the data associated with a user. However, there is no check to ensure that the user being deleted is indeed the user that the admin intends to delete. This means that an attacker who gains admin privileges could delete any user they want, leading to a potential data breach or denial of service attack.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to CWE-284: Improper Access Control. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by gaining admin privileges and deleting any user they want, leading to unintended consequences.",2029,155,6.2201409339904785
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve making a request to an untrusted source based on user input. Instead, it makes a request to a known Dropbox URL based on the recipe's link.",728,58,2.397310495376587
78,CWE-116," Yes, it is vulnerable. The issue is that the `plugin_names` argument is concatenated with the command string using the `join()` method without any form of escaping. This means that if an attacker supplies malicious input for `plugin_names`, it could potentially be executed as part of the shell command.

For example, an attacker could supply a value like `""; rm -rf / --sh` which would be concatenated with the rest of the command, resulting in a command like `/path/to/ansible-runner -j -s -t plugin_type --playbook-dir /path/to/playbooks -M /path/to/modules "" --sh rm -rf /`. This would delete all files in the root directory of the host system.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `plugin_names` argument should be properly escaped before being concatenated with the command string. One way to do this would be to use a library or function specifically designed for escaping shell commands, such as the `shlex.quote()` function in Python.",1447,235,9.136910438537598
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it checks for the presence of a session variable and returns a LoginButton based on the session information.",961,57,2.300426721572876
80,CWE-601, NO. The given code does not contain any functionality that would allow for an attacker to redirect the user to a malicious site. The code only performs some data validation and updates a database record. The `redirect` function is used to redirect the user to a legitimate URL after a successful update.,1020,61,2.458070755004883
81,CWE-264," YES, the code is vulnerable to token chaining attacks as described in CVE-2012-3426 and CWE-264. The code does not properly implement token expiration, allowing remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining.",3270,68,3.0674610137939453
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not involve constructing or modifying OS commands using externally-influenced input. Instead, it retrieves a code snippet from a configuration file and executes it in a local Python environment using the `exec()` function, which does not involve OS command execution.",1021,75,2.9835097789764404
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 as it does not involve constructing file paths from external input. Instead, it defines a function `gcd` and calculates the common factors of two integers using that function.",653,55,2.175534248352051
84,CWE-352," NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE. It is a function for finding the common factors of two numbers.

85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input or data from an untrusted source in an insecure manner.

86,CWE-835," The given code for the `data_received` function is not vulnerable to an infinite loop or CWE-835. The loop in the code exits when the condition `self._buffer` is false, which is checked after the parsing of each message is completed. Therefore, there is no risk of entering an infinite loop.

However, it's important to note that the `commonFactors` function provided in the code snippet is not related to the vulnerability assessment of the `data_received` function. The `commonFactors` function is a separate function and should be evaluated for its own potential vulnerabilities.",897,135,5.270327568054199
87,CWE-444," Yes, the code is vulnerable. The issue is that the `smuggle_url` function call allows for the passing of arbitrary `http_headers` to be included in the request to the Vimeo server. This could potentially allow an attacker to perform HTTP header injection attacks, such as setting a Referer header to a malicious URL, or setting a cookie header to steal session cookies. This vulnerability falls under the CWE-444 category, as described in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions.",1681,109,4.419032335281372
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error URL.

95,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, specifically Reflected XSS. The vulnerability lies in the way user-controllable data (custom\_column\_expected) is being rendered without proper escaping or sanitization.
