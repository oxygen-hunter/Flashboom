83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 as it does not involve constructing file paths from external input. Instead, it is a dynamic programming algorithm for finding good strings in two given strings.",1154,48,1.9913575649261475
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE or CWE. It is a completely different function that calculates something based on strings and does not involve handling HTTP requests or JSON data.,1827,46,2.0102555751800537
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input or data from an untrusted source in a way that could lead to log spoofing or other authentication bypass attacks. Instead, it is processing a JSON allowlist and validating regular expressions in a config file, which is not the same thing as unsanitized UUIDs being passed by a rogue agent as in the CVE description.",1187,99,3.9705910682678223
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for `data_received` function does not contain an infinite loop, and it is not vulnerable to CWE-835. The `findGoodStrings` function is unrelated to the vulnerability discussion and is not vulnerable as well.",1398,56,2.3061256408691406
87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that is inconsistent with how the messages will be processed by the ultimate destination. Instead, it simply constructs and returns a dictionary with various video metadata.",2182,82,3.4178171157836914
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the error message passed to the `urlencode()` function. The attacker can inject malicious scripts in the `reason` parameter, which will be reflected back in the URL and executed by the victim's browser.",2452,76,3.2411653995513916
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations and does not construct file paths using user-controlled input, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or any other file-related vulnerabilities.",1203,50,2.0659587383270264
90,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not involve file operations and is not related to the described vulnerability (CWE-22). It is a separate function for string processing.,1196,36,1.5416550636291504
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in the way that could lead to SSRF attacks. Instead, it is a standalone Python function that calculates the result based on predefined inputs.",1197,62,2.508098840713501
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it is a dynamic programming solution for a string problem.",1249,53,2.1780712604522705
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it is a dynamic programming solution for a string problem.",1242,53,2.177696943283081
94,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in a way that could lead to server-side request forgery (SSRF). Instead, it is a standalone Python function that performs string matching and dynamic programming calculations.",1243,65,2.635917901992798
95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users. Instead, it is a function for finding good strings based on given patterns and characters, and does not involve rendering user-generated content.",2831,69,3.0341413021087646
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it only deals with internal database queries and object manipulation.",1852,55,2.395965337753296
97,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it only deals with internal database queries and object manipulation.",1852,55,2.3654353618621826
98,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it processes form data and calls a local helper function to convert book formats.",1720,58,2.476707935333252
99,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it processes form data and calls a local helper function to convert book formats.",1720,58,2.500199317932129
100,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it focuses on processing local file paths and database operations.",2248,54,2.376922130584717
