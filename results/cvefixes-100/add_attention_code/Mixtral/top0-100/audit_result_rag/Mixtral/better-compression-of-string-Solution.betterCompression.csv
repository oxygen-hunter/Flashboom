An attacker who is not an admin user could potentially delete other users' data by providing a valid user ID to the _delete_user function. This is a violation of the authorization principle in access control.",2066,69,2.916351079940796
77,CWE-918, NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server Side Request Forgery) as it is making a request to a Dropbox link and not allowing user input to modify the URL.,765,47,1.9000990390777588
78,CWE-116," Yes, it is vulnerable. The issue is that the `plugin_names` argument is concatenated with the command string using the `join()` method without proper escaping. This could allow an attacker to inject shell commands by providing specially crafted plugin names containing shell metacharacters.

For example, an attacker could provide a plugin name like `""plugin_name""; rm -rf /` to execute the `rm -rf /` command on the target system.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `plugin_names` argument should be properly escaped before being concatenated with the command string. One way to do this is by using a quoting mechanism like `shlex.quote()` to escape any shell metacharacters in the plugin names.

Here's an example of how to modify the `prepare_plugin_docs_command()` function to properly escape the `plugin_names` argument:

```python
import shlex

def prepare_plugin_docs_command(self, plugin_names, plugin_type=None, response_format=None,
                              snippet=False, playbook_dir=None, module_path=None):

    if response_format and response_format not in DocConfig._supported_response_formats:

82,CWE-78," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The `exec` function executes the given code as if it were part of the Python interpreter, which means that any code retrieved from an untrusted source can execute arbitrary OS commands. In this case, the `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile` function is retrieving code from an untrusted source, so an attacker could potentially inject and execute OS commands through this function.
