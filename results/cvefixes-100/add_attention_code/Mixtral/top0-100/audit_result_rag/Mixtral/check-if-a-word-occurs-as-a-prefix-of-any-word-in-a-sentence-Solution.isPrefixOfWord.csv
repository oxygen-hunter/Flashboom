1,CWE-918," Yes, the code is vulnerable. The issue is that the `url` parameter is not sufficiently validated or sanitized before being passed to the `requests_session.request()` function. An attacker could potentially provide a malicious URL that the application will make a request to, potentially bypassing access controls and allowing the attacker to conduct actions they should not be able to. In this specific case, the code does include a check for private addresses, but this is not sufficient to prevent SSRF attacks as the attacker could still provide a valid private address that the application trusts. To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should validate and sanitize the `url` parameter before making the request, such as by checking that it only contains expected schemes and hostnames, and that it does not contain any unexpected parameters or query strings. Additionally, the application should consider using a library or module specifically designed to prevent SSRF attacks, such as the Advocate library mentioned in the CVE description.",1781,208,8.100101709365845
2,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve making external HTTP requests based on user input. Instead, it defines a function `is_private_address` that takes a URL as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the IP address associated with that URL is a private address or not. It does this by performing a DNS lookup to obtain the IP address, and then using the `ipaddress` library to determine if the address is private. There is no user input involved in this process, so there is no risk of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or any other type of attack that could exploit this code.",1155,144,5.6619486808776855

The function is only performing input validation and appending arguments to a command list, it does not directly construct or execute shell commands with user-supplied input.

However, the `isPrefixOfWord` function is a separate issue and should not be considered related to the vulnerability of the `prepare_plugin_docs_command` function. The `isPrefixOfWord` function uses a custom KMP algorithm to search for a pattern in a given sentence. It does not involve any command line arguments or shell command execution, so it is not related to the original vulnerability.",1627,156,6.150683403015137
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it defines a function for checking if a given sentence starts with a specific word or if the word is a prefix of the sentence.",1141,63,2.6491599082946777

81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration and allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining or leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account or an account with a changed password.",3450,67,3.060837984085083
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not involve constructing or executing OS commands using externally-influenced input. Instead, it defines a helper function `KMP` and an instance method `isPrefixOfWord` for a class, which perform string matching using the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm.",1201,79,3.251460075378418
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve handling file paths or external input in a way that could allow an attacker to traverse outside of a restricted directory.

84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE-2021-32677 and CWE-352. It is a function for checking if a string is a prefix of another string using the KMP algorithm.,1506,58,2.4451727867126465
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input in an unsanitized manner. The `validate_agent_data` function is only processing the 'allowlist' key from the agent_data dictionary, which is assumed to be properly formed JSON. The `isPrefixOfWord` function is a separate utility function that does not involve user input or data validation.",866,91,3.5600132942199707
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for the function `data_received` does not contain an infinite loop as described in the CWE-835 vulnerability. The code is parsing incoming data and checking for complete messages, if not enough data is received, it returns. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the described Denial of Service attack.

The `isPrefixOfWord` function is unrelated to the given vulnerability and is not vulnerable as well. It uses the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm to find the position of a given pattern in a text string. It does not contain any infinite loops or other vulnerabilities.",1077,135,5.3125386238098145
87,CWE-444," The given code is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE.

88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error URL.

95,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the use of `mark_safe()` or similar functions to render user-controllable input directly in HTML without proper escaping.
