The outerTrees function is not related to the data_received function and does not contain any buffer handling or parsing logic, so it is not vulnerable to the same Denial of Service issue as the data_received function.",1390,76,3.0938785076141357
87,CWE-444, NO. The given code does not appear to act as an intermediary HTTP agent and does not parse or interpret HTTP messages in a way that could allow for smuggling attacks as described in the CWE-444 description. The code is primarily focused on parsing video metadata from a dictionary-like object and returning a dictionary with various video information.,2174,74,3.208265542984009
88,CWE-79," The given code for the function `_get_unauth_response` is not directly related to the `outerTrees` function provided. Therefore, I cannot evaluate the vulnerability of `_get_unauth_response` based on the given information.

However, I can tell you that the `outerTrees` function itself does not appear to be vulnerable to XSS attacks based on the provided code. The function does not take any user-controllable input and does not generate any web pages or responses that could contain unescaped user data.

Therefore, my answer is 'NO'. The `outerTrees` function is not vulnerable to XSS attacks based on the provided code.",2444,149,6.01765775680542
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve constructing a pathname from user-controlled input, and therefore it is not vulnerable to path traversal attacks.",1195,33,1.435002326965332
90,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve constructing a pathname from user-controlled input, and therefore it is not vulnerable to path traversal attacks.",1188,33,1.424635648727417
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to receive a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieve the contents of this URL without sufficient validation. Instead, it performs various calculations and data structures manipulations within the function scope.",1189,48,1.9941871166229248
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to file path traversal attacks as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it performs various mathematical calculations and data structures manipulations.",1241,47,1.9549243450164795
93,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not construct a pathname using user-controlled input and does not appear to be vulnerable to path traversal attacks.,1234,31,1.3566241264343262
94,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to receive or process user-controlled URLs or similar requests, and therefore does not fit the description of CWE-918.",1235,38,1.621220350265503
95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users. Instead, it is a function for calculating the circumscribed circle of a set of points.",2823,61,2.735283374786377
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it only deals with internal database queries and object manipulation.",1844,55,2.359745502471924
97,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it only deals with internal database queries and object manipulation.",1844,55,2.3622283935546875
98,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests using user-supplied data. Instead, it processes form data internally and calls helper functions with predefined arguments.",1712,56,2.363755702972412
99,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests using user-supplied data. Instead, it processes form data internally and calls helper functions with predefined arguments.",1712,56,2.3706705570220947
100,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it focuses on creating a book object and handling local file paths and database operations.",2240,59,2.594200849533081
