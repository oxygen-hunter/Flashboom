78,CWE-116," The given code for `prepare_plugin_docs_command` function is not directly vulnerable to CWE-116 as it does not involve constructing a command from user-supplied data without proper escaping. However, the `minCost` function provided in the code snippet is not related to the original code and does not seem to have any vulnerabilities related to CWE-116 either.",1486,86,3.461106061935425
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it checks for the presence of a session and extracts user information from it.",1000,53,2.277371406555176
80,CWE-601, NO. The given code does not contain any functionality that would allow for an attacker to redirect the user to a malicious site. The code only performs database updates and renders a template.,1059,40,1.7128610610961914
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration and allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens or leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account or an account with a changed password.",3309,64,3.003469228744507
82,CWE-78," YES, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the execution of the retrieved code using the `exec()` function, which can lead to OS command injection if the retrieved code contains malicious commands. The `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile()` function may retrieve code from an untrusted source, making this vulnerability potentially exploitable.",1060,80,3.2378125190734863
83,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not involve file operations and is not vulnerable to CWE-22. It only defines a function `load` and another function `minCost` with no file-related operations.,692,44,1.7681961059570312
84,CWE-352," NO. The given code is not related to web application security or handling user requests. It is a function definition for a method named 'test_post_broken_body' which is testing a POST request using FastAPI test client and checking the response status code and JSON content. It does not involve any user input or request validation, hence it is not vulnerable to CWE-352 or any other type of web application security vulnerabilities.",1365,93,3.7869560718536377
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input or data from an untrusted source in an insecure manner. Instead, it is validating JSON data and calling a function `config.valid_exclude_list()` to validate regular expressions.",725,68,2.683516263961792
86,CWE-835," The given code for `data_received` function is vulnerable. The reason is that the while loop condition `while self._buffer:` will never be false as the buffer is being continuously updated with new data. This creates an infinite loop, which can be exploited by an attacker to consume excessive resources.",936,64,2.5554516315460205
87,CWE-444," The given code is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE. The code is a Python function for parsing video data, and it does not involve intermediary HTTP communication or message parsing. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-444 or CVE-2023-46121.

However, the minCost function provided in the code snippet is not related to the vulnerability discussion and should be disregarded when evaluating the vulnerability of the _parse_video function.",1720,118,4.7914838790893555
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the URL with urlencode(). This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the URL, which will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the page.",1990,77,3.223050355911255
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve constructing a pathname from user-controlled input, and therefore it is not vulnerable to path traversal attacks. The code only performs some calculations based on given inputs.",741,44,1.7905240058898926
90,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve constructing a file path from user-controlled input, and therefore it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) attacks. The code only performs some calculations based on given arguments.",734,52,2.097097396850586
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to receive or process user-controlled input that could be used to construct a URL or similar request to an unexpected destination. Instead, it only performs file operations using a predetermined path based on the settings.",735,53,2.1680476665496826
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing a file path using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded path to the Flask-RESTX static files.",787,61,2.494856357574463
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing a file path from user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded path to the'static' directory within the 'flask_restx' library.",780,67,2.6793389320373535
94,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in the same way as the described vulnerability. Instead, it is a function for calculating the minimum cost to move from a start position to a home position on a grid, given row and column costs.",781,73,2.872715473175049
95,CWE-79," Based on the given code, the `test_custom_field_table_render` function does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The function is not dynamically generating web pages with user-controllable input that is not properly sanitized before being placed in the output. Instead, it is comparing expected values with the values of cells in a pre-existing table, and the values are hardcoded in the script. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",2369,106,4.31361198425293
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions.
