74,CWE-79," YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting). The vulnerability arises from the lack of input validation and sanitization of user-supplied data (bad_url and good_url) in the construction of the URLs. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application, which can then be executed in the context of the web server's domain, leading to potential security risks such as data theft, unauthorized access, and privilege escalation.",2409,110,4.502220392227173
75,CWE-918," The given Python code for the function `_delete_user` is not directly related to the provided CVE or CWE descriptions. The code appears to be deleting user data based on certain conditions. However, it does not involve handling URLs or requests to unexpected hosts or ports, which are the key factors in the described vulnerabilities. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",1834,78,3.2021260261535645
76,CWE-284," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper access control checks. The code deletes a user and all associated data if the following condition is met:

1. The query returns at least one user with the role of 'ADMIN'.
2. The user to be deleted is not 'Guest'.

However, there is no check to ensure that the user making the call to this function has the 'ADMIN' role. This means that any user can call this function and delete any other user, including the 'ADMIN' user, if there is no 'ADMIN' user present in the system. This is a clear violation of the principle of least privilege and can lead to unintended consequences.",1976,158,6.257970571517944
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or CWE-918. The code is making a request to a Dropbox link, which is not under the control of the attacker, and there is no evidence of the code allowing arbitrary URL construction or modification. The code is also not using any user-supplied data in the construction of the URL, which is a common vector for SSRF vulnerabilities.",675,99,3.8428821563720703
78,CWE-116," Yes, it is vulnerable. The issue is that the `plugin_names` argument is concatenated with the command string using the `join()` method without any form of escaping. This means that if an attacker supplies malicious input, it could potentially be executed as part of the command on the host system rather than the virtual environment. This is a classic example of command injection vulnerability.",1394,83,3.341801404953003
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs.

81,CWE-264," Yes, it is vulnerable to CWE-264, token reuse attack. The code does not properly check the expiration or revocation status of the tokens being used for authentication, allowing an attacker to use an old token to bypass intended authorization restrictions. This vulnerability is similar to the one described in the given CVE-2012-3426.",3217,82,3.5850491523742676
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not involve constructing or executing OS commands using externally-influenced input. Instead, it defines a Python function called 'load' that retrieves and executes a boilerplate file, and another function'maximumSum' that calculates the maximum sum of elements in a list using a simple algorithm. These functions do not involve OS command execution or manipulation of user-supplied input in a way that could lead to OS command injection.",968,113,4.443847894668579
83,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not involve file operations and is not related to the described vulnerability (CWE-22). It is a separate function for finding the maximum sum of a list of integers.,600,44,1.7612488269805908
84,CWE-352," NO. The given code is not related to the CWE-352 vulnerability described in the CVE. The code is a unit test for a FastAPI endpoint, and it is checking that the server returns an error when it receives an invalid JSON payload. This is a good practice for input validation and does not introduce any vulnerability.",1273,71,2.897318124771118
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input or data from an untrusted source in an insecure manner.

This issue is similar to the described CWE-835 vulnerability in the provided CVE description.",844,74,2.90421199798584
87,CWE-444," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable to CWE-444. The issue lies in the usage of the `smuggle_url` function, which allows the passing of arbitrary `http_headers` to the Vimeo URL request. This can potentially allow an attacker to perform HTTP header injection attacks, leading to unintended consequences such as cookie exfiltration or other forms of data leakage. The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-2023-46121, although the specific library or framework used in the given code is not explicitly mentioned.",1628,129,5.26020622253418
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error URL. The attacker can inject malicious scripts into the URL, which will be reflected back to the victim's browser and executed.",1898,70,2.9936606884002686
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve constructing a pathname from user-controlled input, and thus it is not vulnerable to path traversal attacks. The code only performs a simple calculation using a list of integers.",649,47,1.8837478160858154
