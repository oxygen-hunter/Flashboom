Additionally, the code does not handle errors properly. If an error occurs during the deletion process, the code will raise an exception but it does not provide any meaningful error message or log the error. This can make it difficult to diagnose and fix issues that arise during the deletion process.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should check if the admin user is trying to delete their own account or not before deleting any user data. It should also handle errors properly by logging the error message and providing a meaningful error message to the user.

Furthermore, the code uses a recursive DFS function which seems unrelated to the user deletion functionality. It is recommended to remove this function or ensure that it is properly secured and does not introduce any additional vulnerabilities.",2193,255,9.961558818817139
77,CWE-918, NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server Side Request Forgery) as it is making a request to a Dropbox link and not allowing user input to modify the URL. The dfs function is unrelated to the vulnerability in question.,892,61,2.459840774536133
78,CWE-116," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-116 as it does not involve constructing a command from user-supplied data without proper escaping. Instead, it constructs a list of arguments to be passed to a command, which is not the same thing.",1611,62,2.5831940174102783
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it checks the session data of an incoming request to determine if the user is logged in and adapts the label of a LoginButton accordingly. The dfs function is an unrelated recursive function used for a different purpose.",1125,83,3.2777175903320312
80,CWE-601," NO. The given code does not contain any function or feature that performs a redirect using a user-controlled input. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-601 (Open Redirect).

The `_moderate` function does not accept or process any URL values from user input. Instead, it performs an update on a database record and returns a redirect to the topic page. The redirect URL is determined by the application itself, not by user input.

The `dfs` function is a recursive depth-first search algorithm and does not involve any redirection or user input.",1184,127,4.997756004333496
81,CWE-264," YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration and allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining or leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account or an account with a changed password.",3434,68,3.0994186401367188
82,CWE-78," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The `exec` function is used to execute a string as Python code. In this case, the code being executed is retrieved from an untrusted source (`config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`), making it susceptible to CWE-78 (OS Command Injection). An attacker could potentially inject and execute arbitrary OS commands or Python code.",1185,93,3.7828338146209717
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve handling file paths or external input in a way that could allow an attacker to traverse outside of the intended directory. Instead, it is a recursive function for finding all possible combinations of a list.",817,70,2.769305467605591
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE-2021-32677 or CWE-352. The code is a unit test for a FastAPI endpoint using the FastAPI test client and the pytest library. It does not involve handling JSON payloads with incorrect content-types or CSRF attacks.,1490,79,3.2663965225219727
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input or data from an untrusted source in an insecure manner. Instead, it is validating JSON data and calling a function to validate regular expressions, which does not involve any authentication or spoofing risks. The second code snippet provided is unrelated to the first code snippet and is a recursive function implementation for a depth-first search algorithm.",850,99,3.9032435417175293
86,CWE-835," The given code for `data_received` function is not vulnerable to CWE-835 as it has a clear exit condition in the form of an empty buffer `while self._buffer:` and the loop is not influenced by an attacker.

However, the `dfs` function provided in the code snippet is not related to the vulnerability discussion and it is not vulnerable to CWE-835 as well, as it has a clear recursive exit condition in the form of an empty list `if not nums:`.",1061,115,4.549560785293579
87,CWE-444, The given code for `_parse_video` function is not vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities. It is just parsing the video data and returning the required information. The `smuggle_url` function call is not related to the vulnerability as it is just making an HTTP request with some headers.,1845,85,3.497309923171997
88,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error URL. This can allow an attacker to inject and execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser.",2115,65,2.857685089111328
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a predefined setting (settings.backup.folder) to construct the file path.",866,61,2.439707040786743
90,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a predefined setting (settings.backup.folder) to construct the file path.",859,61,2.4319825172424316
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve sending user-controlled data to an external server or making HTTP requests. Instead, it is a recursive function for finding all possible combinations of a list.",860,56,2.255080223083496
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not construct a pathname using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded path to the'static' directory within the 'flask_restx' library.",912,65,2.5874290466308594
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing a file path from user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded file path that is not subject to user manipulation.",905,60,2.4459187984466553
94,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in a way that could lead to server-side request forgery (SSRF). Instead, it is a recursive function for finding all possible combinations of a list.",906,65,2.591862678527832
95,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, specifically Reflected XSS. The vulnerability lies in the way user-controllable data (custom\_column\_expected) is being rendered without proper escaping or validation. The attacker could inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code in the custom\_column\_expected dictionary, which would then be rendered in the web page and executed in the victim's browser.",2494,94,3.966520071029663
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions.
