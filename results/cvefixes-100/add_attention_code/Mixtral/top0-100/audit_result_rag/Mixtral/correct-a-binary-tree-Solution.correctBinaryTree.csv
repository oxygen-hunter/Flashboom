81,CWE-264," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration and allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens or leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account or an account with a changed password. The code does not check the validity or expiration of the provided tokens, and it creates new tokens without any checks on the provided credentials. This can lead to unintended access to resources and unauthorized actions.",3275,108,4.5672032833099365
82,CWE-78," YES, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the execution of arbitrary code using the `exec()` function.

85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input or data from an untrusted source in the same way as the code in the CVE description. Instead, it is validating JSON data and calling a function to validate regular expressions, which does not involve unsanitized UUIDs or spoofing attacks.",691,81,3.2268104553222656
86,CWE-835," YES, the given code is vulnerable to an infinite loop due to the while loop condition `while self._buffer:` which can be influenced by an attacker if they can send malformed data causing the buffer to never be empty. This can lead to excessive memory consumption. The CWE-ID for this vulnerability is CWE-835.",902,73,2.9046013355255127
87,CWE-444, NO. The given code does not appear to be an intermediary HTTP agent and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses. It is simply extracting information from a dictionary-like object called 'video'.,1686,44,1.973074197769165
88,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error URL. This can allow an attacker to inject and execute malicious scripts in the context of the web application.",1956,66,2.915459394454956
89,CWE-22," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it is a function for manipulating a binary tree.",707,54,2.1767020225524902
90,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not involve file operations and is not related to the described vulnerability (CWE-22). It is a function for correcting a binary tree.,700,38,1.5642147064208984
91,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input that could be used to construct URLs or similar requests to unexpected destinations. Instead, it defines a function for manipulating a binary tree.",701,60,2.381925344467163
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it is constructing a static file path using hardcoded directory names.",753,57,2.2834904193878174
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it is a function for manipulating a binary tree.",746,53,2.17315936088562

The code is for testing a custom field table render in Django, while the vulnerability described in the CVE is related to Nautobot, a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform, and its incorrect usage of Django's `mark_safe()` API when rendering user-authored content.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting or any other type of XSS attack based on the information provided.",2335,127,5.2343854904174805
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions. The code is not making any external HTTP requests or handling any user-supplied URLs, so there is no opportunity for an attacker to manipulate the server into making requests to unexpected destinations.
