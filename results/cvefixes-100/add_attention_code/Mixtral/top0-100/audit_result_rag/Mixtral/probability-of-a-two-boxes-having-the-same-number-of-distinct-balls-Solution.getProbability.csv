1,CWE-918," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the fact that the `url` parameter is not sufficiently validated or sanitized before being passed to the `requests_session.request()` function. An attacker could potentially provide a malicious URL that could lead to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The code does include some checks for private addresses, but these checks do not prevent SSRF attacks. To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the `url` parameter before passing it to the `requests_session.request()` function. This could be done by using a library or module specifically designed for URL validation and sanitization, or by implementing custom checks and sanitization logic in the code.",1868,161,6.39527702331543

1. There exists an admin user in the system.
2. The user to be deleted is not the 'Guest' user.

However, there is no check to ensure that the user making the call to the `_delete_user` function is an admin user. This means that any user can call this function and delete any other user, including admin users, as long as there is at least one admin user in the system. This is a clear violation of the principle of least privilege and can lead to unintended consequences.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to CWE-284: Improper Access Control.",2296,175,6.937011003494263

86,CWE-835," NO. The given code does not contain an infinite loop, as it always exits the while loop when self._buffer is empty. The code block provided is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE information.",1164,49,2.028320789337158
87,CWE-444," The given code for `_parse_video` function does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities, and it does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that is inconsistent with how the messages will be processed by the ultimate destination. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",1948,83,3.4272968769073486
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error_params string.
