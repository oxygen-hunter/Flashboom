76,CWE-284," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper access control checks. The code deletes a user and all associated data if the following condition is met:

1. The query returns at least one user with the role of 'admin'.
2. The user to be deleted is not 'Guest'.

However, there is no check to ensure that the user making the call to the `_delete_user` function is an admin user. This means that any user can call this function and delete any other user, including admin users, which is a clear violation of the access control principle.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to CWE-284: Improper Access Control. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to delete any user, including admin users, and gain unauthorized access to the system.",2187,182,7.263741731643677
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server Side Request Forgery) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests using user-supplied data. Instead, it makes a single request to a Dropbox share link, which is not user-supplied and is generated by the Dropbox library.",886,72,2.856602668762207
78,CWE-116," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-116 as it does not involve constructing a command from user-supplied data without proper encoding or escaping. Instead, it constructs a list of command-line arguments and appends them to a pre-existing list, which is then used to construct the final command using string concatenation. This is not the same as constructing a command from user-supplied data, and the code does not exhibit the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE descriptions provided.",1605,116,4.617655277252197
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it checks the session data of the incoming request to determine the user's login status.",1119,55,2.2454917430877686
80,CWE-601, NO. The given code does not contain any functionality that would allow for an attacker to redirect the request to a malicious site. The code only performs data modification and rendering operations.,1178,38,1.6114397048950195
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration and allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining or leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account or an account with a changed password.",3428,68,3.1010279655456543
82,CWE-78," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The `exec` function is used to execute a string as Python code. In this case, the code being executed is retrieved from an untrusted source (`config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`), making it susceptible to CWE-78 (OS Command Injection). An attacker could potentially inject and execute arbitrary OS commands or malicious Python code.",1179,95,3.802396297454834
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve handling or constructing file paths. Instead, it defines a function `load` that retrieves and executes a code snippet from a configuration file. This behavior does not involve file I/O or path manipulation, and therefore is not susceptible to path traversal attacks.",811,86,3.355543613433838
84,CWE-352," NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE-2021-32677 or CWE-352. It is a function for simulating the outcome of rolling dice, and does not involve handling HTTP requests or parsing JSON data.",1484,63,2.6732053756713867
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input or data from an untrusted source in an insecure manner. Instead, it is validating JSON data and calling a function `config.valid_exclude_list()` to validate regular expressions.",844,68,2.6780972480773926
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-835 as it does not contain an infinite loop. The loop in the code exits when the buffer does not contain enough data to form a complete message, or when an exception is raised during message parsing.",1055,57,2.405824899673462
87,CWE-444," The given code for `_parse_video` function does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities, and it does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that is inconsistent with how the ultimate destination entities will process them. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",1839,81,3.37648344039917
88,CWE-79," The given code `_get_unauth_response` function is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the fact that the error message passed as a parameter `reason` is not properly escaped before being included in the URL query string. This can lead to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code in the `reason` parameter, which will then be included in the URL query string and executed in the victim's browser when they visit the page. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as stealing sensitive information, performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim, or even taking control of the victim's machine.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to Type 1: Reflected XSS attacks. To mitigate this vulnerability, the error message should be properly escaped before being included in the URL query string. This can be done using a library such as Django's `urlencode` function, which automatically escapes special characters. Alternatively, the error message can be passed as a template variable and escaped using a template engine such as Django's `gettext` function.",2109,244,9.641114234924316
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations using user-controlled input, and hence it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) attacks. The code is a separate function for a dice simulator and does not interact with the file system.",860,58,2.373582601547241
90,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations and does not construct file paths using user-controlled input, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or any other file-related vulnerabilities.",853,50,2.0207791328430176
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to receive a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieve the contents of this URL without sufficient validation. Instead, it uses the local file path to send a file using the send_file function.",854,51,2.068159818649292
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded path to the Flask-RESTX static files.",906,60,2.4978652000427246
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded path to the Flask-RESTX static directory.",899,60,2.4179821014404297
94,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled URLs or similar requests. Instead, it defines a function `swaggerui_static` for serving static files and another function `dieSimulator` for a different purpose, which is not related to handling URLs.",900,75,2.963519334793091
95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users. Instead, it is testing the rendering of expected values for custom columns in a table, and does not involve any user input or web page generation.",2488,71,3.054996967315674
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions.
