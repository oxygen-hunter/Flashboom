74,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation and sanitization of user-controllable data (URLs) before they are used in the generation of web pages served to other users. This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

In the given code, the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` strings are generated by interpolating user-controllable data (`bad_url` and `good_url`) into a template. If these data contain malicious scripts, they will be executed when the generated URLs are visited by a user in their web browser.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the user-controllable data should be validated and sanitized before being used in the generation of web pages. This can be done by using a library or function that is specifically designed to handle URL input validation and sanitization, such as Django's `is_safe_url` function.

Here's an example of how the code could be modified to use Django's `is_safe_url` function:

```python
from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe

#...

77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve making an HTTP request to a user-supplied URL. Instead, it uses a hardcoded Dropbox URL to retrieve a file.",1081,52,2.1641650199890137
78,CWE-116," The `prepare_plugin_docs_command` function provided in the code snippet does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-116 (Improper Escaping of Input). The function takes in a list of plugin names as an argument and appends it to the command line arguments using the `join()` method. Since the plugin names are already in a list format, there is no need for any additional escaping or encoding.

However, it's important to note that the code snippet does not show the execution of the command using the `command` variable. Therefore, it's impossible to determine if there are any other parts of the code that may be vulnerable to CWE-116 or other types of vulnerabilities.

Regarding the second code snippet, it's a separate function called `minCost` and it doesn't seem to be related to the `prepare_plugin_docs_command` function. Therefore, it's not relevant to the vulnerability assessment of the first function.

So, the answer is: NO.",1800,227,8.856935024261475
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it is a function for finding the minimum cost of two lists.",1314,50,2.0857396125793457
80,CWE-601," NO. The given code does not contain any open redirect vulnerability as it does not use user-controlled input to redirect to an external site. Instead, it uses the `redirect` function to redirect to a predefined URL based on the `next` parameter or the topic's absolute URL.",1373,62,2.607954263687134
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration and allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens or leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account or an account with a changed password.",3623,63,2.9835469722747803
82,CWE-78," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the use of `exec()` function which executes the given code as a part of the current Python script. Since the code is retrieved from an untrusted source (`config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`), an attacker can inject arbitrary OS commands by manipulating the retrieved code. This can lead to OS command injection, as described in the CWE-78 description.",1374,106,4.217098236083984
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve handling file paths or external input that could be used to traverse outside of a restricted directory. Instead, it defines and uses an internal function 'nth\_element' for finding an element in a sorted list, and another function'minCost' for finding the minimum cost of swapping elements between two lists.",1006,92,3.6606156826019287
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE-2021-32677 and CWE-352. It is a completely different function that deals with finding an element in a sorted list using the quickselect algorithm.,1679,59,2.5243782997131348
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it does not involve handling user input or data from an untrusted source in an insecure manner. Instead, it is a function for finding the minimum cost to form a basket using elements from two given lists.",1039,63,2.627595901489258
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for the `data_received` function does not contain an infinite loop, as it has a clear exit condition (the `while self._buffer` loop exits when `self._buffer` is empty). The `minCost` function, on the other hand, is not related to the vulnerability discussed in the initial code snippet.",1250,76,3.1847338676452637
87,CWE-444, NO. The given code does not appear to act as an intermediary HTTP agent and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that could allow for smuggling attacks as described in the CWE-444 description. The code is simply parsing a dictionary-like object (presumably from an API response) and constructing a new dictionary with some transformations. There is no HTTP request or response handling involved.,2034,92,3.8494327068328857
88,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter passed to the _get_unauth_response function. The vulnerable line is:

login_url = force_str(reverse(""shuup_admin:login"") + ""?"" + error_params)

The error_params variable is generated by urlencode({""error"": force_text(reason)}) which does not properly encode the user-supplied reason string. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code in the reason parameter, which will be reflected back in the login_url and executed in the victim's browser.",2304,151,6.158763408660889
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations using user-controlled input, and hence it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) attacks.",1055,38,1.6090939044952393
90,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations and does not construct file paths based on user input, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or any other file-related vulnerabilities.",1048,48,1.9778587818145752
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in the same way as the vulnerable code in the CVE description.

92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded path to the Flask-RESTX static directory.",1101,60,2.479511260986328

94,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in the same way as the vulnerable code example provided. Instead, it defines a local function `swaggerui_static` that returns a file using a hardcoded file path.",1095,67,2.6879186630249023
95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users. Instead, it is a function for finding the minimum cost of two lists, and it uses the `tri_partition` function internally, which is not related to the vulnerability described in the provided context.",2683,84,3.637758731842041
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs.

98,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests using user-supplied data.
