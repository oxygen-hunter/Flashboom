Instead, it constructs command-line arguments from pre-existing data and appends them to a list, which is then joined into a single command string using the `join()` method. This does not involve any shell command injection vulnerabilities.",1613,89,3.6230428218841553
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it is a function for finding the minimum starting index of a pattern in a string using the Z-algorithm.",1127,59,2.3875865936279297
80,CWE-601," NO. The given code does not contain any functionality that would allow for an attacker to redirect the request to a malicious site. The code only performs some data validation and updates the database, and then renders a template. The z-function defined in the code is not related to the vulnerability at hand.",1186,65,2.6301615238189697
81,CWE-264," YES, the code is vulnerable to token chaining attacks as described in CVE-2012-3426 and CWE-264. The code does not properly implement token expiration, allowing remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining.",3436,68,3.101836919784546
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not construct or execute any OS commands using externally-influenced input. Instead, it defines a function `z_function` and uses it to calculate the length of the longest prefix of the string `s` that is also a prefix of the string `pattern`. This function does not involve any OS commands or user input, and the `load` function simply executes the code from a file using `exec()`, which is not inherently vulnerable to OS command injection.",1187,116,4.585079193115234
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 as it does not involve constructing file paths from external input. Instead, it defines a function `minStartingIndex` that uses string manipulation and the `z_function` helper function to find the starting index of a pattern in a string.",819,69,2.8206560611724854
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE-2021-32677 or CWE-352. The code is for a function to find the starting index of a pattern in a string using the Z-algorithm.,1492,60,2.515265703201294
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input or data in an unsanitized manner. Instead, it is validating JSON data and calling a function to validate regular expressions, which does not involve user input or data from an untrusted source.",852,68,2.693798065185547
86,CWE-835, NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-835 as it does not contain an infinite loop. The code is implementing a message parsing function and it exits the loop once a complete message is received or an exception is raised. The z-function implementation in the given code is not related to the vulnerability and is used for a different purpose.,1063,76,3.065791130065918
87,CWE-444," Based on the given code, the function `_parse_video` is not vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities. It is simply extracting information from a dictionary-like object `video` and returning a new dictionary. There is no HTTP request or response being intermediated by this function.",1847,81,3.3203935623168945
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error URL. The attacker can inject malicious scripts into the error message, which will be reflected back to the user in the URL, and subsequently executed by the user's browser.",2117,79,3.296088933944702
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve constructing a pathname from user-controlled input, and thus it is not vulnerable to path traversal attacks. The code only deals with string manipulation and pattern matching.",868,45,1.8493609428405762

91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve sending user-controlled data to an external server or making HTTP requests. Instead, it defines a local function and uses it to calculate the starting index of a pattern in a string.",862,61,2.4334771633148193
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a predefined path to the'static' directory within the application.",914,58,2.332005262374878
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input.

94,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in a way that could lead to SSRF attacks.

95,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the use of `mark_safe()` or similar functions to render user-controllable input directly in HTML context without proper escaping. In the given code, the `rendered_value` from the `bound_row` is directly compared with the `col_expected_value` which may contain user-controllable input, and if the input is not properly sanitized, it could lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

The `LocationTable` and `CustomFieldColumn` classes, as well as the `Location` model, are not shown in the code snippet, but based on the given context, it is assumed that they are Django models or related classes, and the `LocationTable` is likely to be a Django Table2 or similar library that generates HTML tables based on querysets. In such cases, the Django `mark_safe()` function or similar functions are often used to render HTML or JavaScript snippets directly in the table cells, which can lead to XSS vulnerabilities if not used properly.

To mitigate the vulnerability, the user-controllable input should be properly sanitized before being rendered in HTML or JavaScript context. This can be achieved by using Django's built-in template filters, such as `safe` or `escapejs`, or by using a library like",2496,301,11.728435516357422
