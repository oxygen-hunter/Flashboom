The code deletes a user and all associated data based on the condition that an admin user exists and the user to be deleted is not ""Guest"". However, there is no check to ensure that the user making the call to this function is an admin user. This means that any user can call this function and delete other users, which is a clear violation of the principle of least privilege and can lead to unintended consequences.",2656,111,4.629908323287964
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve making HTTP requests to user-supplied URLs. Instead, it uses a hardcoded Dropbox URL and does not allow user input to modify the URL in any way.",1355,60,2.4742634296417236
78,CWE-116," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-116 as it does not involve constructing or passing shell commands directly from user input. Instead, it constructs command line arguments using predefined options and a list of plugin names, which are not user-supplied inputs.",2074,63,2.68684983253479
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it is a function for calculating the maximum score of a list of numbers based on the number of distinct prime factors of each number.",1588,64,2.6489198207855225
80,CWE-601," The given code for the function `_moderate` is not vulnerable to the described CWE-601 Open Redirect vulnerability. The reason is that the code does not use any user-controlled input to redirect the request to an external site. Instead, it only renders a template and redirects the request to a predefined URL based on the topic object. Therefore, there is no risk of phishing attacks or other malicious activities through this code.",1647,98,3.9631106853485107
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration, allowing remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining or leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account or an account with a changed password.",3897,67,3.1212046146392822
82,CWE-78," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not involve constructing or executing OS commands using externally-influenced input. Instead, it defines several local functions and uses them to calculate the maximum score based on the given list of numbers and a specified value of k.",1648,67,2.788733959197998
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 as it does not involve constructing file paths from external input. Instead, it defines and executes a local Python script, which is not subject to path traversal attacks.",1280,53,2.199620485305786
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE. It is a separate Python function for calculating the maximum score of a list of numbers based on the number of distinct prime factors of each number.,1953,51,2.263916492462158
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not have any apparent vulnerability related to CWE-290 or CVE-2022-23949. The code is not handling user input or data from an untrusted source, and it is not related to authentication or spoofing attacks. Instead, it is a separate function for calculating scores based on prime factors of numbers in a list.",1313,86,3.4672915935516357
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-835 as it does not contain an infinite loop. The code is parsing incoming data and processing it, and if an error occurs, it returns.",1524,45,1.9234681129455566
87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that is inconsistent with how the messages will be processed by the ultimate destination. Instead, it is a Python function that processes a video dictionary and returns a dictionary with video information.",2308,87,3.6876277923583984
88,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the URL with urlencode(). This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the error message, which would then be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the page.",2578,80,3.5462467670440674
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations and does not construct paths based on user input, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or CVE-2023-50264.",1329,53,2.2676424980163574
90,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not involve file operations and does not construct file paths based on user input. It is a separate function for calculating scores based on a list of numbers and prime numbers.,1322,41,1.735163688659668
91,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input that could be used to construct URLs or similar requests to unexpected hosts or ports.
