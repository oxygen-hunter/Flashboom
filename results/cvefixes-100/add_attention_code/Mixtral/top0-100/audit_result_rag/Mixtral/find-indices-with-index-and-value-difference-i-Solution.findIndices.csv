It is just a simple function that returns the indices of two elements in a list that satisfy certain conditions.",2119,114,4.707846641540527
76,CWE-284," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of access control checks when deleting user data. The code only checks if there is an admin user present and if the user to be deleted is not the ""Guest"" user. However, it does not check if the user making the request has the necessary permissions to delete a user. This can allow unauthorized users to delete other users' data.",2261,88,3.6553025245666504
77,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or CWE-918. The code is not making any HTTP requests based on user input, and it is not using the response content in an unsafe way. Instead, it is making a single, hardcoded request to the Dropbox API using the recipe.link attribute, which is generated by the Dropbox.get\_share\_link() function.",960,97,3.829101085662842
78,CWE-116," The `prepare_plugin_docs_command` function is not vulnerable to CWE-116 as it does not construct or manipulate shell commands using user-supplied data. The function only appends arguments to a list, which is later used to construct a command using a hardcoded executable path. There is no evidence of any shell command construction or manipulation occurring in this function.

However, the `findIndices` function is not related to the original question and should not be evaluated for vulnerabilities related to CWE-116. It is a separate function with a different purpose.",1679,127,5.050595760345459
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it checks for the presence of a session variable and returns a LoginButton based on that information.",1193,56,2.4154739379882812
80,CWE-601," NO. The given code does not contain any function or feature that performs a redirect using a user-controlled input. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-601 (Open Redirect).",1252,43,1.8122813701629639
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration, allowing remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining. The code does not check the expiration of the old token before creating a new one.",3502,66,3.0215489864349365
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not involve constructing or executing OS commands using externally-influenced input.

83,CWE-22," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve handling file paths or external input in a way that could allow an attacker to traverse outside of a restricted directory. Instead, it is a function definition for finding indices in a list based on certain conditions.",885,72,2.8991687297821045
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE. It is a function for finding indices of two numbers in a list with a certain difference.,1558,40,1.7502522468566895
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it does not involve handling user input or data from an untrusted source in an unsanitized manner, which is the root cause of the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE descriptions. Instead, the code is defining and using a function `findIndices` which takes in a list `nums` and two integers `indexDifference` and `valueDifference` as arguments and returns the indices of the first occurrence of two distinct elements in the list that have a given index difference and value difference.",918,128,5.034888744354248
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for the function `data_received` does not contain an infinite loop as described in the CWE-835 vulnerability. The loop in the code exits when the condition `self._buffer` is false, which will eventually be the case once all data has been processed. The `findIndices` function does not contain a loop at all, so it is not vulnerable to this type of issue.",1129,90,3.64251708984375
87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not involve intermediating HTTP requests or responses in an inconsistent manner. Instead, it is parsing Vimeo video metadata and returning a dictionary with the parsed data. The `smuggle_url` function call does not involve interpreting or modifying HTTP headers in a way that could lead to inconsistent interpretation between the intermediary and the ultimate destination.",1913,98,3.981511354446411
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter passed to the _get_unauth_response function. The vulnerable line is: error_params = urlencode({""error"": force_text(reason)})

This line constructs an error_params string by encoding the user-supplied reason parameter without proper validation or encoding. An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the reason parameter, which will then be reflected back in the error message and executed by the user's browser.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and encode the reason parameter before using it in the error message or URL. This can be done using a library like Django's built-in escape filter or a similar library for other web frameworks.",2183,183,7.171590566635132

95,CWE-79," NO.

The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users.

98,CWE-918," The given Python code for the `convert_bookformat` function is not directly related to the `findIndices` function provided, so I cannot evaluate its vulnerability based on the code snippet given. However, I will evaluate the `convert_bookformat` function based on the description and context provided in the initial code snippet.

Based on the description and context provided, the `convert_bookformat` function appears to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks as described in the CWE-918 vulnerability. The function retrieves user-supplied input (`book_format_from` and `book_format_to`) and uses it to construct a file path for the `helper.convert_book_format` function call. If an attacker can supply a malicious URL or file path, they may be able to execute arbitrary commands or access sensitive data on the server.

Therefore, the answer is 'YES' and the vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation and sanitization for the `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` variables. To mitigate this vulnerability, the input should be validated and sanitized to ensure that it only contains expected characters and does not contain any URL schemes or other potentially dangerous input. Additionally, the server should implement access controls to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.",1451,297,11.455944299697876
99,CWE-918," The given Python code for the `convert_bookformat` function is not directly related to the `findIndices` function provided, so I cannot evaluate its vulnerability based on the code snippet you have given. However, I will evaluate the `convert_bookformat` function based on the description and context you have provided.

Based on the description and context you have provided, the `convert_bookformat` function appears to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, as it retrieves user-supplied input (`book_format_from` and `book_format_to`) and uses it to construct a URL that is passed to the `helper.convert_book_format` function. Since the user can control the `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` values, they can potentially craft malicious URLs that the server will attempt to access, possibly bypassing access controls and performing unintended actions.

Therefore, the answer is 'YES' and the vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation and sanitization of user-supplied data, which can be exploited to perform SSRF attacks.",1451,251,9.684051990509033
