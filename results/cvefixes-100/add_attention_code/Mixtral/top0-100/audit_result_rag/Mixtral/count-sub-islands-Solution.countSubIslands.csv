78,CWE-116," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-116 as it does not involve constructing or passing shell commands. Instead, it constructs a list of command-line arguments and appends them to a list, which is then used to create a command by appending it to a list containing the executable path. There is no evidence of any input being directly passed to a shell command without proper escaping or encoding.",1553,93,3.7645440101623535
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it is a function for checking the login status of a user and creating a LoginButton object accordingly.",1067,57,2.3190908432006836
80,CWE-601, NO. The given code does not contain any functionality that would allow for an external URL to be specified and used in a redirect. The code only deals with internal objects and operations within the application.,1126,40,1.6928291320800781
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly validate or check the authenticity and authorization of the provided tenant and user credentials. The code accepts both password-based and token-based authentication methods, but it does not perform any checks on the provided tenantName or tenantId, allowing an attacker to potentially authenticate with an unintended tenant or even a disabled user account. This could lead to unauthorized access to resources and data within the system.",3376,105,4.517421007156372
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not construct or modify OS commands using externally-influenced input. Instead, it defines a local function `dfs` and uses it within the `countSubIslands` function, which does not involve any OS command execution.",1127,67,2.6980397701263428
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 as it does not involve constructing file paths from external input. Instead, it defines a function `dfs` that is used internally within the `countSubIslands` function and does not interact with the file system.",759,64,2.580946922302246
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the CWE-352 vulnerability described in the CVE. The code is a FastAPI test function that checks for a validation error when sending a request with an incorrect content type or incorrectly formatted JSON data. It does not involve handling user requests or input in a way that could lead to a CSRF attack or other type of request forgery.,1432,85,3.4951694011688232
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it does not involve any unsanitized user input or authentication schemes. Instead, it is a function for validating JSON data and performing a depth-first search on a 2D grid.",792,60,2.47611403465271
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for `data_received` function does not contain an infinite loop. The loop condition `while self._buffer:` is checked at each iteration, and the buffer is being emptied with each message received and parsed. Therefore, the loop cannot enter an infinite state.

The `countSubIslands` function is not related to the vulnerability discussion and is safe as well.",1003,84,3.3037288188934326
87,CWE-444," The given code for `_parse_video` function does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities. It is simply extracting information from a dictionary-like object `video` and returning a dictionary. There is no HTTP request or response being intermediated by this function. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",1787,88,3.5899124145507812
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter passed to the _get\_unauth\_response function. The vulnerable lines are:

error_params = urlencode({""error"": force_text(reason)})
login_url = force_str(reverse(""shuup_admin:login"") + ""?"" + error_params)

These lines construct a URL with the user-supplied ""reason"" parameter without proper validation or encoding, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that can be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the URL.",2057,147,6.021642446517944
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations using user-controlled input, and hence it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) attacks.",808,38,1.5702033042907715
90,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not involve file operations and is not related to the described vulnerability (CWE-22). It is a function for counting islands in a 2D grid.,801,41,1.6755352020263672
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to receive or process user-controlled input that could be used to construct a URL or similar request to an unexpected destination. Instead, it defines a local function `dfs` and uses it to perform a depth-first search within the given grids.",802,61,2.421185255050659
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded path to the Flask-RESTX static files.",854,60,2.440713882446289
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it is a function for counting the number of islands in a 2D grid.",847,59,2.3623545169830322
94,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to receive or process user-controlled URLs or similar requests, and therefore is not vulnerable to CWE-918 or SSRF attacks.",848,41,1.7675085067749023
95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users. Instead, it is a function for comparing two grids and counting the number of sub-islands in the second grid that have corresponding islands in the first grid.",2436,75,3.2617173194885254
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions. The code is not making any external HTTP requests or handling any user-supplied URLs, so there is no opportunity for an attacker to manipulate the server into making requests to unexpected hosts or ports. Instead, the code is simply querying a local database and adding new database records based on the input provided.",1457,99,3.9552109241485596
97,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions. The code is not making any external HTTP requests or handling any user-supplied URLs, so there is no opportunity for an attacker to manipulate the server into making requests to unexpected destinations. Instead, the code is simply querying a local database and adding new records based on the input provided.",1457,97,3.868122100830078
98,CWE-918," The given code for `convert_bookformat` function is not directly vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CWE-918. The function is not making any external HTTP requests or processing any user-supplied URLs. Instead, it is using local variables `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` which are supposed to be obtained from the form data submitted by the user.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'. The code is not vulnerable to SSRF as described in CWE-918.",1325,124,4.875562429428101
99,CWE-918," The given code for `convert_bookformat` function does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the provided CVE and CWE. The reason being that the code does not involve making external HTTP requests using user-supplied data, instead it only uses data from `request.form` to perform internal operations. Therefore, it does not meet the conditions for SSRF vulnerability.

However, the `countSubIslands` function is not related to the given code and does not involve any network requests, so it is not vulnerable to SSRF either.",1325,129,5.04285192489624
100,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it deals with internal data structures and operations.",1853,52,2.313918113708496
