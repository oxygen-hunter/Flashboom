The code does not check the validity or expiration of the provided tokens before creating new ones.",3535,68,3.319375991821289
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not involve constructing or executing OS commands using externally-influenced input. Instead, it defines a function `topological_sort` and uses it to perform a topological sort on two lists, which is then used to build a matrix.",1286,71,2.8729262351989746
83,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not use external input to construct a file path and does not appear to be vulnerable to path traversal attacks.,918,29,1.2453553676605225
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE. It is a function for building a matrix based on given conditions.,1591,35,1.5741727352142334
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it does not involve handling user input or data from an untrusted source in an unsanitized manner, which is a common cause of this vulnerability. Instead, it performs a topological sort on pre-existing lists and creates a matrix based on the sorted indices.",951,76,3.0113396644592285
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code does not contain an infinite loop, as it always exits the while loop when self._buffer is empty. The code for buildingMatrix function is not related to the vulnerability in the data_received function.",1162,49,2.155832052230835
87,CWE-444, NO. The given code does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that could allow for smuggling attacks as described in the CWE-444 description. The code is only parsing a dictionary-like object and extracting specific values from it.,1946,68,2.9345972537994385
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error_params string. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the URL, which will be executed by the victim's browser when they visit the page.",2216,77,3.3574929237365723
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations and does not construct file paths using user-controlled input. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or any other file-related vulnerabilities.",967,51,2.0816681385040283
90,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations and does not construct file paths from user-controlled input. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or any other file-related vulnerabilities.",960,51,2.0667078495025635
91,CWE-918, NO. The given code does not involve handling user-controlled input that could lead to SSRF attacks or any other type of vulnerability described in the CWE-918 description. The code is a standalone function that builds a matrix based on given conditions and does not involve any network requests or file handling.,961,67,2.7012875080108643
92,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not involve file operations and is not vulnerable to CWE-22.,1013,22,1.0558085441589355
93,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not involve file operations and is not vulnerable to CWE-22.,1006,22,0.9909591674804688
94,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in the same way as the vulnerable code provided in the context. Instead, it defines a function `swaggerui_static` that returns a file using a static path, which is not susceptible to SSRF attacks. The other function `buildMatrix` is an unrelated implementation of a matrix transposition algorithm.",1007,96,3.7720091342926025
95,CWE-79," NO.

The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users. Instead, it is performing a topological sort on a set of conditions and creating a matrix based on the sorted indices.",2595,68,2.9380578994750977
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it only performs database queries using the provided filter values, which are not user-supplied.",1616,62,2.6634161472320557
97,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it only performs database queries using the provided filter values, which are not user-supplied.",1616,62,2.6933529376983643
98,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests using user-supplied data. Instead, it only uses predefined variables and functions.",1484,50,2.156740427017212
99,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests using user-supplied data. Instead, it only uses predefined variables and functions.",1484,50,2.1289103031158447
100,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or CWE-918 as it does not involve constructing or manipulating URLs or external requests in a way that could lead to SSRF vulnerabilities. Instead, it focuses on creating and modifying database records within the local application.",2012,74,3.0910439491271973
