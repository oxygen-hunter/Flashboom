98,CWE-918," The given code for the function `convert_bookformat` is not directly related to the `countSubstrings` function provided. Therefore, I cannot determine if the `convert_bookformat` function is vulnerable based on the given code alone.

However, I can tell you that the `convert_bookformat` function does not appear to be vulnerable to SSRF attacks based on the information provided. The function takes user input for `book_format_from` and `book_format_to`, but it does not use these values to construct a URL or perform a request to an external source. Instead, it passes the values to the `helper.convert_book_format` function, which presumably is a local function or module.

Therefore, my answer is 'NO', the `convert_bookformat` function is not vulnerable to SSRF attacks based on the given code.",1328,186,7.227995157241821
99,CWE-918," The given code for the function `convert_bookformat` is not directly related to the `countSubstrings` function provided, so I cannot evaluate its vulnerability based on the given code alone. However, I will assume the question is asking about the `convert_bookformat` function and provide an answer based on that.

Yes, the `convert_bookformat` function is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The function retrieves user-supplied input (`book_format_from` and `book_format_to`) and uses it to construct a path for the `helper.convert_book_format` function call. If an attacker can manipulate these inputs, they can potentially cause the function to make requests to arbitrary URLs, bypassing access controls and potentially gaining unauthorized access to internal resources.",1328,179,7.026975393295288
