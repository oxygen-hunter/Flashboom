77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not have any functionality related to handling user-supplied URLs or making HTTP requests using those URLs. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or any other related vulnerabilities.",1151,52,2.1708035469055176
78,CWE-116," NO. The given code does not construct a command from user-supplied input without proper escaping, and it does not use the input to construct a structured message for communication with another component. The vulnerability described in the provided context does not apply to this code.",1870,55,2.351592779159546
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it is a function for generating a palindrome string based on an input integer 'n' and an integer 'k'.",1384,62,2.618454933166504
80,CWE-601," NO. The given Python code does not contain any open redirect vulnerability as described in CWE-601. The code is not handling any user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site and using that link in a Redirect. Instead, it is handling internal data and performing database updates. The second code snippet is an unrelated function for finding the largest palindrome number with a given length and base.",1443,91,3.646667242050171
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration and allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens or leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account or an account with a changed password.",3693,63,3.0001604557037354
82,CWE-78," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the use of `exec()` function which executes the given code as a part of the current Python script. Since the code is retrieved from an external source (config.retrieveBoilerplateFile()), it can contain arbitrary OS commands which will be executed when the `exec()` function is called. This can lead to OS command injection attacks as described in the CWE-78 description.",1444,98,4.021207809448242
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 as it does not involve constructing file paths from external input. Instead, it defines a function `load` that retrieves and executes a boilerplate file, which is not user-supplied data. Therefore, there is no path traversal or file manipulation occurring in this code.",1076,79,3.1392359733581543
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE-2021-32677 and CWE-352. It is a function for generating a palindrome number.,1749,49,2.2171499729156494
85,CWE-290, NO. The given code does not appear to be related to the validation of agent data or any authentication scheme. It is a separate function for finding the largest palindrome number with a given length and digit sum.,1109,44,1.8204095363616943
86,CWE-835, NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-835 as it does not contain an infinite loop. The code is a separate function for finding the largest palindrome number and does not have any loop related to the data reception or parsing process.,1320,55,2.259389638900757
87,CWE-444," The given code for `_parse_video` function is not vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities. It is just parsing the video data and returning the required information. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",2104,64,2.7426772117614746
88,CWE-79," The given code for the function `_get_unauth_response` is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that the error message passed as the `reason` parameter is not properly escaped before being included in the URL query string `error_params`.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious JavaScript code as the error message, which will then be reflected back in the URL and executed by the victim's browser when they visit the error page.

Therefore, the answer is 'YES' and the vulnerability is of Type 1: Reflected XSS. To mitigate this vulnerability, the error message should be properly escaped before being included in the URL query string. One way to do this is by using a library or function that can perform URL encoding on the error message.",2374,184,7.2977540493011475
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations using user-controlled input, and hence it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Arbitrary File Deletion or Writing). The code is related to generating a palindrome string based on given input n and k.",1125,60,2.4387691020965576
90,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not involve file operations and is not related to the CWE-22 vulnerability described in the provided context.,1118,30,1.3077497482299805
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve sending user-controlled data to external resources without proper validation. Instead, it is a function for generating a palindrome string based on given input.",1119,55,2.2642252445220947
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing a file path using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded file path to serve static files using Flask's send_file function.",1171,65,2.658738613128662
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses hardcoded directory paths.",1164,50,2.062673330307007
94,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in a way that could lead to server-side request forgery (SSRF).

95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users.

97,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions. The code does not involve handling or constructing URLs or similar requests from upstream components, and it does not retrieve the contents of such requests without sufficient checks. Instead, it simply adds new database objects based on input parameters.",1774,82,3.3446338176727295
98,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs.
