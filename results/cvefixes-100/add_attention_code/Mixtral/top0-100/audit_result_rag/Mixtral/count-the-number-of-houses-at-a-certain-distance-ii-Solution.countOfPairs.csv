However, I will evaluate the `login()` function based on the description and CVE/CWE information provided.

Based on the description and CVE/CWE information, the `login()` function appears to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, as it retrieves the contents of a URL provided by an upstream component (in this case, an LDAP server) without sufficiently ensuring that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

Therefore, the answer is 'YES' and the vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation and insufficient checks on the URL being retrieved from the LDAP server. Attackers could potentially use this vulnerability to conduct port scanning of internal networks, access documents on the system, or use other protocols such as gopher:// or tftp://, which may provide greater control over the contents of requests.",3180,232,9.286494493484497

In this specific code, the vulnerability is present in the following lines:

```python

65,CWE-863," The given Python code for the `send_transactions` function is not directly related to the `countOfPairs` function, so I cannot evaluate its vulnerability based on the provided information. However, I will evaluate the `send_transactions` function based on the given context and CVE description.

Based on the context and CVE description, the `send_transactions` function appears to be vulnerable to the CWE-863 issue, as it does not correctly perform nonce checks. Specifically, the function retrieves the account nonce using `account.get_nonce().call()`, but it does not check if the retrieved nonce is the same as the expected nonce before sending the transaction. This can allow an attacker to replay old transactions with a lower nonce value, potentially leading to unintended consequences such as double spending or unauthorized transactions.

Therefore, the answer is 'YES' and the vulnerability is due to the lack of proper nonce checking in the `send_transactions` function.",1301,224,8.894366025924683
66,CWE-203, NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-203 as it does not exhibit any discrepancies in behavior or response that could reveal security-sensitive information to an unauthorized actor. The code is unrelated to the Saleor Core or Adyen plugin mentioned in the CVE description and creates a Transaction object based on provided parameters. The countOfPairs function is an unrelated utility function that calculates the number of pairs in an array and does not contain any security vulnerabilities.,1614,109,4.3577024936676025
67,CWE-203," I cannot directly evaluate the given Python code for vulnerabilities as it does not have any apparent connection to the CVE-2023-32694 and CWE-203 description provided. The code snippet seems to be unrelated to the vulnerability discussion. Therefore, my answer is 'NO'.",1856,68,2.855241060256958
68,CWE-601," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-601 as it does not involve accepting a user-controlled input and redirecting to an external site.

73,CWE-93, NO. The given code does not involve handling of CRLF sequences or any special character sequences that could lead to CWE-93 vulnerability. It is just a function to calculate the number of pairs in an array with given conditions.,805,50,2.0548956394195557
74,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation and sanitization of the 'bad_url' and 'good_url' variables in the 'test_security_check' function. The code constructs URLs using these variables without checking if they are safe or not. This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if an attacker provides malicious URLs as arguments.",2735,93,4.0017499923706055
75,CWE-918," The given code for `_delete_user` function is not directly related to the provided CVE-2022-0339 and CWE-918 description. The `_delete_user` function is checking for admin privileges before deleting a user, and it does not involve any URL or similar request that could be manipulated for SSRF attacks. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",2160,89,3.6738100051879883
76,CWE-284," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper access control checks. The code deletes a user and all associated data if the following condition is met:

1. The query returns at least one user with the role of 'ADMIN'.
2. The user to be deleted is not 'Guest'.

However, there is no check to ensure that the user deleting the user is an admin himself. This means that any user can delete any other user, including admins, if they manage to obtain the user ID of the target user. This is a clear violation of the principle of least privilege and can lead to unintended consequences.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to CWE-284: Improper Access Control. To mitigate this vulnerability, you should add a check to ensure that the user deleting the user is an admin himself before performing the deletion.",2302,197,7.852333068847656

This can lead to unauthorized access to resources and bypassing intended authorization restrictions.",3543,89,3.9630157947540283
82,CWE-78," The given code for the `load` function is vulnerable.
