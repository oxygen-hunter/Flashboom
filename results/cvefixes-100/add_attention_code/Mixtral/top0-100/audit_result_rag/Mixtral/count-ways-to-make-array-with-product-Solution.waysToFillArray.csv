81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration and allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining or leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account or for an account with a changed password.",3684,68,3.235220432281494
82,CWE-78," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the use of `exec()` function which executes the given code as a part of the current Python script. Since the code is retrieved from an untrusted source (`config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`), an attacker can inject arbitrary OS commands by manipulating the retrieved code. This can lead to OS command injection, which is a type of CWE-78 vulnerability.",1435,108,4.284176826477051
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 as it does not involve constructing file paths from external input. Instead, it performs mathematical calculations and uses predefined functions and constants.",1067,45,1.8579480648040771

85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input or data from an untrusted source in an insecure manner. Instead, it is using pre-defined data (queries) and performing calculations based on that data.",1100,61,2.476306200027466
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for `data_received` function does not contain an infinite loop, and it is not vulnerable to CWE-835. The code is handling exceptions and returning from the function when an error occurs during message parsing. The `data_received` function processes incoming data in a finite manner.

The second code snippet provided is not related to the vulnerability discussion and is a separate function for calculating prime factors using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. It does not contain any infinite loops or vulnerabilities related to CWE-835.",1311,126,5.080966949462891
87,CWE-444," The given code for `_parse_video` function does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities, and it does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that is inconsistent with how the messages will be processed by the ultimate destination. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",2095,83,3.458369731903076
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error URL. The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code in the ""reason"" parameter, which will be reflected back in the URL and executed by the victim's browser when they visit the page.",2365,82,3.4554378986358643
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations and does not construct file paths using user-controlled input, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Arbitrary File Deletion or Writing) or CVE-2023-50264.",1116,61,2.586400032043457

95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users. Instead, it is performing calculations and comparisons with expected values, and does not involve generating web pages or handling user input in a way that could lead to XSS vulnerabilities.",2744,78,3.365692615509033
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions.
