71,CWE-93, NO. The given code does not use CRLF sequences as special elements and does not handle user inputs. It is a function for calculating the number of ways to distribute candies among a group of people with certain limitations.,607,47,1.8705968856811523
72,CWE-93," NO. The given code does not use CRLF sequences as special elements and does not process user input that could contain CRLF sequences. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-93.",606,43,1.7303636074066162
73,CWE-93," NO. The given code does not use CRLF sequences as special elements and does not handle user inputs. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-93.",599,36,1.4616844654083252
74,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation and sanitization of the 'bad_url' and 'good_url' variables in the 'test_security_check' function. The code constructs URLs using these variables without checking if they are safe or not, which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if an attacker provides malicious URLs.",2529,91,3.8048622608184814
75,CWE-918," The given code for `_delete_user` function is not directly related to the `distributeCandies` function. Therefore, I cannot evaluate the vulnerability of the `_delete_user` function based on the provided code for `distributeCandies`.

However, I can tell you that the `_delete_user` function appears to be vulnerable to CWE-918, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), as described in the provided context. The function deletes various records related to a user based on the user ID provided as an argument. If an attacker can manipulate the user ID argument, they could potentially delete records for other users or access unintended resources.

Therefore, the answer is 'YES' and the vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation and insufficient access control checks on the user ID argument.",1954,186,7.347931385040283
76,CWE-284," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper access control checks. In the function `_delete_user`, an admin user is deleting another user's data based on the condition that there exists another admin user. However, there is no check to ensure that the calling user is an admin user. This means that any user can call this function and delete another user's data if there is no admin user present. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege and can lead to unintended data deletion.",2096,117,4.715807676315308
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve making HTTP requests to user-supplied URLs. Instead, it makes a request to a known Dropbox URL obtained from the `recipe.link` variable.",795,58,2.322934150695801
78,CWE-116," NO. The given code does not construct a command from user-supplied input without proper escaping or encoding, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-116.

79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it is handling session data and generating a local Python object based on that data.",1028,53,2.158093214035034
80,CWE-601," NO. The given Python code does not contain any functionality that would allow for an open redirect vulnerability as described in the CWE-601 description. The code is for a function named `_moderate` that appears to be handling some sort of topic moderation in a web application, and it does not contain any functionality for redirecting to user-controlled input. The code snippet provided does not appear to be related to the `distributeCandies` function, which is a separate function with a different purpose.",1087,111,4.332260608673096
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration and allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining or leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account or an account with a changed password.",3337,67,3.0481674671173096
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not involve constructing or executing OS commands using externally-influenced input.

83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve handling file paths or external input in a way that could allow an attacker to traverse outside of the intended directory.

85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be related to the validation of agent data or any authentication scheme, and it does not process any user input that could be spoofed. Therefore, it does not exhibit the characteristics of CWE-290.",753,54,2.1583948135375977
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for the function `data_received` does not contain an infinite loop as described in the CWE-835 vulnerability. The loop in the code exits when an exception is raised or when there is not enough data to form a complete message. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the described Denial of Service attack.

The `distributeCandies` function is not related to the given vulnerability and can be ignored for this question.",964,101,3.9900293350219727
87,CWE-444," The given code for `_parse_video` function does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities, and it does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that is inconsistent with how the messages will be processed by the ultimate destination. Instead, it is just constructing a URL using the provided `vimeoVideoURL` and `vimeo_id`, and making an HTTP request to that URL using the `smuggle_url` function. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",1748,129,5.109656810760498
88,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error URL.
