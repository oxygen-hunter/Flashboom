95,CWE-79," The given code for the function `test_custom_field_table_render` is not directly vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks based on the provided context. However, it does handle user-controllable data (`col_expected_value`) that is later rendered as part of the HTML response.

To mitigate potential XSS risks, it's recommended to use Django's `format_html()` function instead of `mark_safe()` when rendering user-controllable data. This will help ensure that any special characters or scripts are properly escaped.

Here's an example of how you could modify the code to use `format_html()`:

```python
rendered_value = bound_row.get_cell(internal_col_name)
col_expected_value = format_html(**col_expected_value)  # Use format_html() instead of mark_safe()
self.assertEqual(rendered_value, col_expected_value)
```

By using `format_html()`, you can ensure that any user-controllable data is properly escaped, reducing the risk of XSS attacks.

However, it's important to note that the `LocationTable` and `CustomFieldColumn` classes, as well as the `Location` model, may have other vulnerabilities or potential issues that could",2393,301,11.697091341018677
