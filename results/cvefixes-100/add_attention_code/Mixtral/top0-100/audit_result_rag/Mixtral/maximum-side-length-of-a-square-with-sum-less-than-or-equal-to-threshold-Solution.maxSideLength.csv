86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for `data_received` function does not contain an infinite loop as described in the CWE-835 vulnerability. The loop in the code exits when the buffer has been parsed successfully or an exception is raised. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the described Denial of Service attack.

The `maxSideLength` function is not related to the given vulnerability and can be ignored.",1079,90,3.542816162109375
87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that is inconsistent with how the ultimate destination entities will process them. Instead, it simply constructs and returns a dictionary with video metadata.",1863,79,3.3031091690063477
88,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error URL.
