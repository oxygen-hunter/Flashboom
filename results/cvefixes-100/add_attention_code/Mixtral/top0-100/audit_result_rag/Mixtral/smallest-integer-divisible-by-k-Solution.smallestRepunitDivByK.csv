1,CWE-918," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the fact that the code does not sufficiently ensure that the URL being sent in the request is the expected destination. An attacker can provide a malicious URL to the function, which can potentially bypass access controls and allow the attacker to conduct actions that they should not be able to do. In this specific case, the code does not check the URL before sending the request, and the 'is_private_address' check only applies to private addresses, not malicious URLs in general.",1875,115,4.630146741867065

However, I can provide some context about the `send_transactions` function and its potential vulnerabilities. The function appears to be sending transactions to an account, but it does not include any checks on the account or the transactions themselves. This could potentially allow an attacker to send malicious transactions to the account.

The `send_transactions` function does include a check for a `nonce` value, but it only sets the `nonce` value if it is not provided. This means that if an attacker knows the current nonce value, they could potentially reuse it and send a malicious transaction that appears to have a valid nonce.

Additionally, the function does not include any checks on the `calls` parameter, which could potentially allow an attacker to send malicious transaction calls.

Overall, the `send_transactions` function may be vulnerable to replay attacks and malicious transaction calls, depending on the specific implementation and context of the `account` and `signer` objects.

72,CWE-93," NO. The given code does not use CRLF sequences as special elements and does not process user inputs, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-93.",813,35,1.455479383468628
73,CWE-93," NO. The given code does not use CRLF sequences as special elements and does not handle user inputs. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-93.",806,36,1.4896159172058105
74,CWE-79," YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting). The vulnerability is introduced by the lack of input validation and encoding of user-supplied data (bad_url and good_url) in the URL construction. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application, which can be executed in the context of the web server's domain, leading to various malicious activities such as data theft, unauthorized access, and privilege escalation.",2736,105,4.46164608001709
75,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it deletes data from a local database based on the user ID provided.",2161,58,2.5970277786254883
76,CWE-284," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper access control checks. The code deletes a user and all associated data if the following condition is met:

1. The query returns at least one user with the role of 'admin'.
2. The user to be deleted is not 'Guest'.

However, there is no check to ensure that the user deleting the user is an admin himself. This means that any user can delete any other user, including admins, if they know the user ID. This is a clear violation of the principle of least privilege and can lead to unintended consequences.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to CWE-284: Improper Access Control.",2303,159,6.378811597824097
77,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or CWE-918. The code is not making any external HTTP requests based on user input, and it is not using the response content in an unsafe way. Instead, it is making a single, hardcoded request to the Dropbox API to retrieve a file link, and then it is using that link to make a separate request to download the file content. There is no way for an attacker to manipulate the request URL in this code.",1002,117,4.643733263015747
78,CWE-116," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-116 as it does not involve constructing or passing unescaped user-supplied data to a shell command. Instead, it only processes and validates input arguments within the Python environment.",1721,58,2.5078318119049072
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it is a function for checking if a given integer K has a smallest repunit divisor.",1235,56,2.299349308013916
80,CWE-601," NO. The given Python code does not contain any open redirect vulnerability as described in CWE-601.

81,CWE-264," YES, the given Python code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration and allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining or leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account or for an account with a changed password. The code does not check the validity or expiration of the provided tokens, and it creates new tokens without any checks on the provided credentials or the existing tokens. This can lead to unintended access to resources and unauthorized actions.",3544,118,5.157923221588135
82,CWE-78," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not involve constructing or executing OS commands using externally-influenced input. Instead, it defines a function `load` that retrieves and executes a boilerplate file, and another function `smallestRepunitDivByK` that calculates the smallest number with a given digit sequence that is divisible by the given number. These functions do not involve OS command execution or the handling of user-supplied input in a way that could lead to OS command injection.",1295,120,4.800079822540283
83,CWE-22," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve handling file paths or external input in a way that could allow an attacker to traverse outside of a restricted directory. Instead, it is a function for finding the smallest positive integer that cannot be divided by a given number K using the pigeonhole principle.",927,83,3.2514266967773438
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE. It is a completely different function that calculates the smallest number that is a repunit (a number made up only of 1s) and is divisible by a given integer K.,1600,60,2.5068013668060303
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not related to authentication or spoofing attacks.

86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for `data_received` function is not vulnerable to infinite loop or Denial of Service attack as described in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions. The `data_received` function is parsing incoming data and processing it, while the `smallestRepunitDivByK` function is a separate function that calculates the smallest number N such that 10^N % K = 0. These functions do not have any common vulnerabilities or similarities.",1171,104,4.1403045654296875
87,CWE-444, NO. The given code does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that could allow for smuggling attacks as described in the CWE-444 description. The code is simply parsing a dictionary-like object (presumably from an API response) and constructing a new dictionary with some transformations. There is no HTTP request or response handling involved.,1955,90,3.6660757064819336
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error URL. The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute malicious scripts in the context of the web application.",2225,66,2.8509323596954346
89,CWE-22, NO. The given Python code does not involve file operations and is not related to the described vulnerability (CWE-22).

91,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input that could be used to construct URLs or similar requests to unexpected hosts or ports.

94,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in the same way as the vulnerable code provided in the context.

95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users.
