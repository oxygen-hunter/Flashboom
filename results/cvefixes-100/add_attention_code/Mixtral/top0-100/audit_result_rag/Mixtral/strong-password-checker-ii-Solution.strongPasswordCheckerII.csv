An attacker who is not an admin user can potentially delete any user data, including that of other users, by exploiting this vulnerability. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege and can lead to data loss or unauthorized data modification.",2026,77,3.1902828216552734
77,CWE-918," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation and sanitization on the `recipe.link` before making the HTTP request. An attacker can provide a malicious URL that can lead to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, allowing them to access internal resources or bypass access controls. In this specific case, the code is hardcoding the replacement of 'www.dropbox.' with 'dl.dropboxusercontent.' which can be easily manipulated by an attacker to perform SSRF attacks.",725,120,4.788660287857056
78,CWE-116," Yes, it is vulnerable. The issue is that the `plugin_names` argument is concatenated with a space character and then appended to the command line arguments without any form of escaping. This could allow an attacker to inject shell commands by providing specially crafted plugin names containing shell metacharacters.

For example, an attacker could provide a plugin name like `""plugin1; rm -rf /""`. This would be concatenated with a space character and appended to the command line arguments, resulting in the following command being executed:

`[self._ansible_doc_exec_path] + ['-t', 'plugin1'] + ['--playbook-dir', playbook_dir] + ['-M', module_path] + ['plugin1; rm -rf /']`

This would execute the `rm -rf /` command on the host system, potentially causing data loss or other damage.",1444,202,7.805502891540527
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it checks for the presence of a session and adapts the label of a LoginButton based on the user's session information.",958,64,2.5581371784210205
80,CWE-601," Based on the given code, the function `_moderate` is not vulnerable to CWE-601 Open Redirect vulnerability. The code does not redirect to a user-controlled input, instead it redirects to the next page using the 'next' parameter which is not user-controlled. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",1017,74,2.940782308578491
81,CWE-264," Yes, it is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration and allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining or leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account or an account with a changed password.",3267,65,2.958437204360962
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not involve constructing or executing OS commands using externally-influenced input. Instead, it retrieves a code snippet from a file and executes it in the local Python interpreter using the `exec()` function. This behavior is not related to OS command injection.",1018,77,3.1744918823242188
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 as it does not involve constructing file paths from external input. Instead, it executes code retrieved from a file, but the file name is not derived from user input.",650,54,2.2170352935791016
84,CWE-352," NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-352 as it is not related to handling user input or request bodies in an insecure manner. Instead, it is a unit test for checking the response status code and JSON content of a FastAPI application when receiving a POST request with an invalid JSON payload. The test uses the `patch` decorator to simulate an error in the JSON parsing process, and asserts the expected response status code and error message.",1323,100,3.9771623611450195
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input in an unsanitized manner. The `validate_agent_data` function is only processing the `allowlist` key from the `agent_data` dictionary, which is assumed to be safe.",683,68,2.6798038482666016
86,CWE-835," YES, the given code is vulnerable to an infinite loop due to the absence of a check to ensure that there is always enough data to parse a complete message after the current incomplete message has been processed. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause the server to enter into an infinite loop and consume excessive resources.",894,69,2.7371714115142822
87,CWE-444," The given code is not directly related to the CWE-444 vulnerability described in the context provided. The code snippet is a Python method for parsing video data, and it does not involve intermediating HTTP requests or responses in a way that could lead to inconsistent parsing and interpretation of messages. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",1678,74,3.042701482772827
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error URL.

91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not receive a URL or similar request from an upstream component and does not retrieve the contents of such a URL without sufficient validation.

92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing a pathname from user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded path to the'static' directory within the 'flask_restx' library.",745,67,2.6929519176483154
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not use user-controlled input to construct file paths. Instead, it constructs a static path based on hard-coded directories.",738,56,2.231430768966675
94,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in a way that could lead to SSRF attacks. Instead, it is a function for serving static files using Flask. The strongPasswordCheckerII function is not related to the vulnerability discussion.",739,71,2.7956931591033936
95,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, specifically Reflected XSS. The vulnerability lies in the way user-controllable data (custom\_column\_expected) is being used to generate HTML code (rendered\_value) without proper encoding or escaping.

An attacker could manipulate the custom\_column\_expected data to inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code, which would then be executed in the victim's browser when they view the page containing the table. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as data theft, session hijacking, or even taking control of the victim's machine.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the rendered\_value should be properly encoded or escaped before being displayed to the user. This can be done using Django's `format_html()` or `mark_safe()` functions, depending on the specific use case. In this case, it seems that `mark_safe()` was incorrectly used, and it should be replaced with `format_html()` or other appropriate methods to ensure proper encoding and escaping of user-controllable data.",2327,245,9.579930782318115
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions.

98,CWE-918," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The vulnerability arises from the way the `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` values are obtained directly from the user input without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially manipulate these values to include malicious URLs, which would then be executed by the `helper.convert_book_format()` function.
