However, I can evaluate the vulnerability of the `_delete_user` function based on the provided context and CVE description.

Answer: YES

Reason: The `_delete_user` function is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks as it retrieves data based on user-supplied input (content.id) without sufficient input validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially manipulate the content.id parameter to delete other users' data or perform unintended actions on the server. This vulnerability aligns with the CVE description provided.",1974,186,7.40958309173584
76,CWE-284," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper access control checks. The `_delete_user` function deletes a user and all associated data if the following conditions are met:

1. An admin user exists in the system.
2. The user to be deleted is not the 'Guest' user.

However, there is no check to ensure that the calling function or the user making the call has the necessary permissions to delete a user. This means that any user can call this function and delete any other user, including admin users, if there is no admin user present in the system. This is a clear violation of the principle of least privilege and can lead to unintended consequences.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to CWE-284: Improper Access Control. To mitigate this vulnerability, you should add checks to ensure that only authorized users can call the `_delete_user` function. For example, you could add a check to ensure that the calling user has the necessary permissions to delete a user before performing the deletion.",2116,233,9.104625225067139
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve making an HTTP request to an untrusted source. Instead, it only modifies the `recipe.link` attribute and makes a request to Dropbox using the generated link.",815,61,2.4353060722351074
78,CWE-116," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-116 as it does not involve constructing or passing shell commands with user-supplied data without proper escaping. Instead, it constructs command line arguments using predefined keys and a list of plugin names, which is not susceptible to the same type of attack as described in the CVE description.",1534,79,3.27130126953125
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it checks for the presence of a session and adapts the label of a LoginButton based on the user's information.",1048,63,2.538266658782959
80,CWE-601, NO. The given code does not contain any functionality that would allow for an attacker to redirect the request to a malicious site. The code only performs database updates and renders a template.,1107,40,1.6825571060180664
81,CWE-264," Yes, it is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration and allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining or leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account or for an account with a changed password.",3357,66,3.037598133087158
82,CWE-78," YES, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the execution of the retrieved code using the `exec()` function without proper validation or sanitization of the input. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands, leading to a CWE-78 (OS Command Injection) vulnerability. The vulnerable line is: `exec(code, globals())`.

The `load()` function retrieves a code snippet from a file and executes it using the `exec()` function. This is a dangerous practice because it allows the execution of arbitrary code, which can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as OS command injection. In this case, an attacker could inject malicious code that includes OS commands, which would be executed when the `load()` function is called.

The `allCellsDistOrder()` function is not related to the vulnerability and can be ignored.",1108,195,7.5395331382751465
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 as it does not involve constructing file paths from external input. Instead, it defines a function `allCellsDistOrder` and calls `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile` to load a file named ""bs-extensions"" into a string variable `code`, which is then executed using `exec(code, globals())`. This behavior does not involve file I/O or path construction from external input, and therefore is not susceptible to path traversal attacks.",740,116,4.5200111865997314
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE. It is a Python function for generating a list of all cells within a given grid that are reachable from a starting cell.,1413,47,2.001938819885254
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it does not involve any unsanitized user input or authentication schemes. Instead, it is a function that validates the 'allowlist' and 'exclude' fields in the 'agent_data' using JSON parsing and regular expression validation.",773,71,2.868972063064575
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for the function `data_received` does not contain an infinite loop as described in the CWE-835 vulnerability. The loop in the code exits when the condition `self._buffer` is false, which will eventually be the case once all data has been processed. The other function `allCellsDistOrder` does not contain a loop at all, so it is not vulnerable to this type of issue.",984,94,3.785403251647949
87,CWE-444, NO. The given code does not appear to act as an intermediary HTTP agent and does not parse or interpret HTTP messages in a way that could allow for smuggling attacks as described in the CWE-444 description. The code is primarily parsing JSON data from a video object and returning a dictionary with various video metadata.,1768,70,2.9029550552368164
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the fact that the error message is not properly escaped before being included in the URL. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the error message, which will then be reflected in the URL and executed by the victim's browser when they visit the page. This is an example of reflected XSS (Type 1) attack.",2038,82,3.551499128341675
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations using user-controlled input, and hence it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) attacks. The code only deals with internal calculations and appending results to a list.",789,53,2.135468006134033

91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to receive a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieve the contents of this URL without sufficient validation. Instead, it is defining a local function and calling it with local variables.",783,47,1.9308245182037354
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing a file path using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded file path to serve static files using Flask's send_file function.",835,65,2.6102194786071777
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded path to the Flask-RESTX static directory.",828,60,2.4510324001312256
94,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in a way that could lead to SSRF attacks. Instead, it is a function for generating a list of cell indices in a 2D grid.",829,63,2.508046865463257
95,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the use of `mark_safe()` or similar functions to render user-controllable input directly in HTML without proper escaping. The `custom_column_expected` dictionary contains user-controllable input that is later rendered as HTML without proper escaping in the `rendered_value` variable. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code in this input, which would be executed in the victim's browser when they view the page containing the table.",2417,117,4.869945526123047
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions.
