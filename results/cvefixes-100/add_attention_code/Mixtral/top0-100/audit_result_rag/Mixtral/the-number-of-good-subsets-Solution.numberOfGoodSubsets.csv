76,CWE-284," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper access control checks. The `_delete_user` function deletes a user and all associated data if the following condition is met:

1. There exists an admin user in the system.
2. The user to be deleted is not the 'Guest' user.

However, there is no check to ensure that the calling function or the caller has the necessary privileges to delete a user. This means that any unauthorized user can call this function and delete other users, which is a clear violation of the access control principle.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to CWE-284: Improper Access Control.",2383,152,6.172144412994385
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests using user-supplied data.

81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration and allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens or leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account or an account with a changed password.",3624,63,2.9230430126190186
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not construct or modify OS commands using externally-influenced input.

83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve handling file paths or external input in a way that could allow an attacker to traverse outside of a restricted directory.

86,CWE-835," NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-835 as it does not contain an infinite loop. The code is parsing incoming data and processing it, and if an error occurs, it returns. There is no infinite loop in the given code.",1251,55,2.258176803588867
87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to act as an intermediary HTTP agent and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that could allow for smuggling attacks as described in the CWE-444 description.

88,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the URL query string.
