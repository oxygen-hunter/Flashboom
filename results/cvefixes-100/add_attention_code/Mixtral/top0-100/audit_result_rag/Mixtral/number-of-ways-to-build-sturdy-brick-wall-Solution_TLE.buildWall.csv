1,CWE-918," The given code for the function `get_response` is not directly related to the `buildWall` function, so I cannot evaluate its vulnerability based on the provided context. However, I can tell you that based on the description and the code snippet you provided earlier, the `get_response` function is vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks due to the use of the `requests` library to make external requests without sufficient input validation.

Therefore, my answer is: 'YES', and the reason is that the code does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination, making it vulnerable to SSRF attacks. Attackers can provide URLs to unexpected hosts or ports, which can bypass access controls and potentially lead to unintended consequences.",1920,168,6.623497486114502

81,CWE-264," The given code for the `authenticate` function is similar to the vulnerable code provided in the question, but there are some differences that make it less vulnerable.

First, the code checks if the user is disabled before creating a new token. This helps prevent unauthorized access even if an attacker manages to obtain a token for a disabled user.

Second, the code uses the `get_tenants_for_user` method to check if the tenant provided in the request is valid for the user. This helps prevent unauthorized access to tenants that the user is not authorized to access.

Based on these observations, the answer is 'NO'. The code is not vulnerable to the CWE-264 weakness described in the question.",3589,158,6.585416078567505
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not construct or execute any OS commands using externally-influenced input. Instead, it defines several functions and uses them internally without any interaction with the operating system.",1340,54,2.2823452949523926
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve handling file paths or external input in a way that could allow an attacker to traverse outside of a restricted directory. Instead, it defines several functions for matrix multiplication and exponentiation, and performs a backtracking algorithm to find patterns based on given input.",972,82,3.273402452468872
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE or CWE. It is a completely different function that deals with matrix multiplication and bitmasking.,1645,39,1.727156639099121
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be related to the validation of agent data, and it does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to CWE-290 or log spoofing.",1005,42,1.8708724975585938
86,CWE-835, NO. The vulnerability described in the first code snippet (an infinite loop) is not present in the second code snippet. The second code snippet defines a different function `buildWall` that does not contain an infinite loop.,1216,49,2.0906314849853516
87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that is inconsistent with how the ultimate destination entities will process them. Instead, it is a Python function that processes a video dictionary and returns a dictionary with some extracted information. The function does not make any HTTP requests or handle HTTP messages.",2000,99,4.217898607254028
88,CWE-79," The given code for the function `_get_unauth_response` is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability exists due to the error message being constructed from user-controllable input (reason) and being returned to the user without proper escaping.

An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code in the reason parameter, which will be reflected back in the error message and executed by the user's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as stealing private information, sending malicious requests to web sites, launching phishing attacks, and even taking over the victim's machine.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to Type 1: Reflected XSS attacks. To mitigate this vulnerability, the error message should be properly escaped before being returned to the user. This can be done using a library like Django's `json.dumps()` with the `ensure_ascii=True` option or by using a library specifically designed for HTML or JavaScript escaping, such as `httplib2.HTMLParser()` or `jsesc`.",2270,239,9.49281907081604
89,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not involve file operations and is not related to the described vulnerability (CWE-22). It is a separate function for building a wall using dynamic programming and matrix exponentiation.,1021,44,1.8433637619018555
90,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not involve file operations and is not related to the described vulnerability (CWE-22). It is a separate function for building a wall using dynamic programming.,1014,40,1.663433313369751

95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users.
