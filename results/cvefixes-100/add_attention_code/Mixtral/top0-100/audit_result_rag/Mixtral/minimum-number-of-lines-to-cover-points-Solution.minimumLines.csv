80,CWE-601," NO. The given code does not contain any function that performs a redirect using a user-controlled input. Instead, it performs an update on a database record and renders a template.",1433,39,1.6989758014678955
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration and allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining or leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account or for an account with a changed password.",3683,68,3.2495157718658447
82,CWE-78," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the use of `exec()` function which executes the given code as a part of the current Python script. Since the code is retrieved from an untrusted source (`config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`), an attacker can inject arbitrary OS commands by manipulating the `code` variable. This can lead to OS command injection, as described in the CWE-78 description.",1434,107,4.234814167022705
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve handling file paths or external input in a way that could allow an attacker to traverse outside of the intended directory. Instead, it defines several helper functions and uses a collections.defaultdict to store sets of points.",1066,73,2.9033942222595215
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE. It is a separate function for finding the minimum number of lines that can cover all given points in a 2D plane.,1739,47,2.037895441055298
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it does not involve handling user input or data from an untrusted source in a way that could lead to log spoofing or other authentication-related vulnerabilities. Instead, it is a separate function for calculating the minimum number of lines that can be drawn through a set of given points.",1099,80,3.175236940383911
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for the `minimumLines` function does not contain an infinite loop or any condition that cannot be reached, making it not vulnerable to the described CWE-835 issue. The code is focused on calculating the minimum number of lines required to cover all given points in a 2D plane.",1310,68,2.7707505226135254
87,CWE-444, NO. The given code does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that could allow for smuggling attacks as described in the CWE-444 description. The code is only parsing a dictionary-like object (presumably from an API response) and constructing a new dictionary with some additional processing.,2094,80,3.3174712657928467
88,CWE-79," The given code for the function `_get_unauth_response` is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that the error message passed as the `reason` parameter is not properly escaped before being included in the URL query string.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious JavaScript code in the `reason` parameter, which will then be reflected back in the URL and executed by the victim's browser when they visit the error page.

Therefore, the answer is 'YES' and the vulnerability is of Type 1: Reflected XSS. To mitigate this vulnerability, the error message should be properly escaped before being included in the URL query string. One way to do this is by using a library or function that can perform URL encoding on the error message.",2364,182,7.208837270736694
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations using user-controlled input, and hence it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Arbitrary File Deletion or Writing) attacks.",1115,43,1.828831672668457
90,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations and does not construct file paths using user-controlled input. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or CVE-2023-50265.",1108,57,2.321354866027832
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve sending user-controlled data to external resources without proper validation.

95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users. Instead, it is validating expected values against the output of a database query.",2743,58,2.5990920066833496
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions. The code does not involve handling or constructing URLs or similar requests from upstream components, and it does not retrieve the contents of such requests without sufficient checks.
