64,CWE-863," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-863 as it does not involve any authorization checks or access control mechanisms. Instead, it is a simple function for sending a transaction with the given parameters and calling another function `send_transactions()`.",731,60,2.3772783279418945
65,CWE-863," Based on the given code, the `send_transactions` function is not directly vulnerable to CWE-863. However, the `get_nonce` function call could potentially be vulnerable if the `account` object is not properly initialized or if it comes from an untrusted source. If an attacker is able to manipulate the `nonce` value, they could potentially replay old transactions or execute unintended transactions. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the `account` object is properly initialized and comes from a trusted source before calling `get_nonce`.

The `removeInterval` function is not related to the vulnerability in question and is not vulnerable to CWE-863.",989,152,5.851180553436279
66,CWE-203," Based on the given code, the `create_transaction` function does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-203 timing attacks. The function's behavior does not depend on external inputs in a way that could be observable to an attacker, and there are no discernible discrepancies in its response based on different inputs or internal state.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",1302,86,3.442718029022217
67,CWE-203," Based on the given code snippet, it does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CWE-203 issue. The code is handling different transaction types and updating the payment object accordingly, but it does not seem to be revealing any security-sensitive information through observable discrepancies or side channels.

However, it's important to note that the code snippet provided is an incomplete function, and it's not possible to evaluate the entire system or context based on this alone. It's always recommended to perform a thorough security analysis on the entire application and its components.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",1544,135,5.313484191894531

75,CWE-918," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The issue lies in the fact that the code deletes records based on user input (content.id) without sufficient input validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially provide a malicious URL as the content.id, causing the application to make a request to that URL instead of deleting the intended user record. This could lead to unintended data deletion or unauthorized access to internal resources.",1848,104,4.182823419570923
76,CWE-284," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper access control checks. In the if condition, the code checks if there is an admin user other than the one being deleted. However, it does not check if the user calling the _delete_user function is an admin user. This means that any user can call this function and delete other users, including admin users, as long as there is at least one admin user left in the system. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege and can lead to unintended consequences.",1990,118,4.739810228347778
77,CWE-918," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation and the use of the `requests.get` function with a user-supplied URL.

78,CWE-116," Based on the given code, the `prepare_plugin_docs_command` function does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-116 (Improper Escaping of Input). The function is constructing a command line argument list and appending it to a list, which is then appended to the command that is executed. There is no evidence that user-supplied data is being directly included in the command string without proper escaping.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",1408,104,4.114151239395142

84,CWE-352," NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-352 as it does not involve handling user input or requests without sufficient verification. Instead, it is a test function for checking the response of a POST request with invalid JSON data, and it uses a patch to simulate an error in JSON parsing.",1287,66,2.6753220558166504
85,CWE-290," Based on the given code, the `validate_agent_data` function is not directly vulnerable to CWE-290 as it does not involve unsanitized user input or authentication schemes. However, the `config.valid_exclude_list` function called within `validate_agent_data` is not shown in the code snippet, so it's impossible to determine if that function is vulnerable to CWE-290 or any other vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO', but with the caveat that the `config.valid_exclude_list` function could potentially be vulnerable, depending on its implementation.",647,138,5.30983567237854
86,CWE-835," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The reason is that the while loop in the data_received function may enter an infinite state if an exception is raised during message parsing.

87,CWE-444," Yes, the code is vulnerable. The issue is that the `smuggle_url` function call allows for the passing of arbitrary `http_headers` in the request. This could potentially allow an attacker to smuggle malicious headers to the ultimate destination server, leading to potential security vulnerabilities such as cookie exfiltration or other unintended consequences. The use of the `smuggle_url` function in this context is not recommended due to this vulnerability.",1642,101,4.0785839557647705

95,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the use of `mark_safe()` or similar functions to render user-controllable input directly in HTML without proper escaping. In the given code, the `rendered_value` from the `get_cell()` method is directly compared to `col_expected_value` without any validation or escaping, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts if they can manipulate the input.

The `custom_column_expected` dictionary contains user-controllable input, which is later rendered in the HTML without proper escaping. For example, the `url_field` and `multi_choice_field` values contain HTML and JavaScript code, respectively, which can be executed in the victim's browser if the code is not properly sanitized.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should use Django's `format_html()` or similar functions to properly escape user-controllable input before rendering it in HTML. Additionally, appropriate object permissions should be applied to restrict which users are permitted to create or edit the user-authored content.",2291,248,9.71960186958313
