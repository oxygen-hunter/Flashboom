87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that is inconsistent with how the messages will be processed by the ultimate destination. Instead, it is a Python function for parsing video data and returning a dictionary with video information.",1988,87,3.6463510990142822
88,CWE-79," The given code for the function `_get_unauth_response` is vulnerable to Reflected XSS attacks (Type 1). The vulnerability arises from the fact that the error message passed as the `reason` parameter is not properly escaped before being included in the URL query string. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code in the `reason` parameter, which will then be reflected back in the URL and executed by the victim's browser.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the error message should be properly escaped before being included in the URL query string. This can be done using a library like Django's `urlencode()` function, which automatically escapes special characters. Alternatively, you can manually escape the error message using techniques like HTML encoding or JavaScript encoding.

Here's an example of how to properly escape the error message using Django's `urlencode()` function:

```python
error_params = urlencode({""error"": force_text(reason)})
# Replace the following line with the following line to properly escape the error message
error_params = urlencode({""error"": force_text(django.utils.html.escape(reason))})
```

By properly escaping the error message, you can prevent attackers from injecting malicious JavaScript code into the URL query string and executing it in the victim's browser.",2258,299,11.866892337799072
