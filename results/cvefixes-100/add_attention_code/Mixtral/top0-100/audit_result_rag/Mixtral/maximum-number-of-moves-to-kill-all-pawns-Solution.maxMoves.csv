1,CWE-918," The given code for the function `get_response` is not directly related to the `maxMoves` function provided, so I cannot evaluate its vulnerability based on this code alone. However, I will provide some general information about the `get_response` function based on the code snippet you provided earlier.

The `get_response` function appears to be making HTTP requests using the `requests` library. Based on the CWE description you provided, this function could be vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks if it does not sufficiently ensure that the URL being requested is the expected destination. In the code snippet you provided, there does not seem to be any checks being performed on the `url` parameter beyond checking if it is a private address and enforcing a block if so. Therefore, it is possible that an attacker could provide a malicious URL that the function will make a request to, potentially bypassing access controls and allowing the attacker to conduct actions they should not be able to.

However, it is important to note that the code snippet you provided is incomplete and does not show the implementation of the `is_private_address` function or the `settings` object. It is possible that there are additional checks being performed in these areas that would mitigate the risk of SSRF attacks.

82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not involve constructing or executing OS commands using externally-influenced input. Instead, it defines several local functions and uses them to perform board game logic.",1548,53,2.3937137126922607
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve handling or constructing file paths. Instead, it performs a breadth-first search algorithm and manipulates lists and integers.",1180,55,2.2550594806671143
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the web application vulnerability described in the CWE-352. It is a separate function for a different purpose.,1853,35,1.6069509983062744
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be related to the validation of agent data or any form of authentication, and it does not process or handle user input in a way that could lead to spoofing attacks. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-290 or any other authentication-related vulnerabilities.",1213,67,2.7004594802856445
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for `data_received` function does not contain an infinite loop, and it is not vulnerable to CWE-835. The `data_received` function processes incoming data in a finite loop, and it exits the loop when it has received a complete message or encounters an error. The `maxMoves` function is unrelated to the `data_received` function and does not contain an infinite loop either.",1424,97,3.877490282058716
87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to act as an intermediary HTTP agent and does not parse or interpret HTTP messages in a way that could allow for smuggling attacks as described in the CWE-444 description. Instead, it is a Python function that processes video data and returns a dictionary with video information.",2208,68,2.875565528869629
88,CWE-79," The given code for the function `_get_unauth_response` is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the error message passed as the `reason` parameter is not properly escaped before being included in the URL query string. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the URL, which will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the page.

Therefore, the answer is 'YES' and the reason is that the code does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users, leading to a reflected XSS vulnerability.",2478,150,6.105027437210083
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations using user-controlled input, and hence it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) attacks.",1229,38,1.630927562713623
90,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve constructing a pathname from user-controlled input, and therefore is not vulnerable to path traversal attacks.",1222,32,1.3964216709136963
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to receive a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieve the contents of this URL without sufficient validation. Instead, it defines a local function `backup_download` that returns a file using the `send_file` function with a valid local file path.",1223,63,2.565261125564575
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses hardcoded directory paths and filenames.",1275,54,2.2366111278533936
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses hardcoded directory paths and filenames.",1268,54,2.22516131401062
94,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in the same way as the vulnerable code example provided. Instead, it is a function for calculating the maximum number of moves in a given board state.",1269,61,2.4839460849761963
95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed in output that is used as a web page served to other users. Instead, it is a Python function for performing a breadth-first search and making moves in a game.",2857,68,2.997509002685547
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions. The code does not involve handling or constructing URLs or similar requests from upstream components, and it does not retrieve the contents of such requests without sufficient checks.",1878,68,2.8519725799560547
97,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions. The code does not involve handling or constructing URLs or similar requests from upstream components, and it does not retrieve the contents of such requests without sufficient checks.",1878,68,2.853055715560913
98,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests using user-supplied data. Instead, it uses internal data structures and calculations.",1746,49,2.107483386993408
99,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests using user-supplied data. Instead, it uses internal data structures and calculations.",1746,49,2.105950117111206
100,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it focuses on internal database operations and file handling.",2274,53,2.4206645488739014
