1,CWE-918," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the fact that the code does not sufficiently ensure that the URL being sent in the request is the expected destination. An attacker can provide a malicious URL to the function, which can potentially bypass access controls and allow the attacker to conduct actions that they should not be able to do. In this specific case, the code does not check the URL before making the request, so an attacker can potentially use Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to make requests to internal resources or perform other unintended actions.",1898,121,4.890013217926025

75,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it deletes data from a local database based on certain conditions.",2184,56,2.449002981185913
76,CWE-284," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper access control checks. In the function `_delete_user`, an admin user is required to delete a user. However, there is no check to ensure that the calling user is an admin user. This means that any user can call this function and delete other users, which is a violation of the access control principle.",2326,84,3.6763834953308105
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or CWE-918. The code is making an HTTP request to a Dropbox link, but it is not constructing the URL from user input, so there is no risk of an attacker being able to manipulate the request to access unintended resources.",1025,78,3.1272759437561035
78,CWE-116," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-116 as it does not involve constructing or passing shell commands. Instead, it constructs a list of command-line arguments and appends them to a list, which is then appended to a list containing the executable path. There is no evidence of user input being directly incorporated into the command string without proper escaping or encoding.",1744,86,3.4879026412963867
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it is a function for checking the login status of a user and generating a login button based on that status.",1258,59,2.4859697818756104
80,CWE-601," NO. The given Python code does not contain any open redirect vulnerability as described in CWE-601. The code is not handling any user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site and using that link in a Redirect. Instead, it is handling the input as a local Topic object pk and performing database updates based on that input.",1317,78,3.146371603012085
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264 (Weak Access Control) due to the lack of proper input validation and authorization checks on the 'auth' parameter. The code allows users to authenticate with either a username/password combination or a token/tenantName combination, and if the 'tenantName' or 'tenantId' is not provided, the token will be considered ""unscoped"" and can later be used to get a scoped token. This can potentially allow unauthorized access to resources in other tenants.",3567,115,4.885783672332764
82,CWE-78," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the use of `exec()` function which allows the execution of arbitrary Python code. In this case, the code being executed is retrieved from an untrusted source (`config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`), making it susceptible to CWE-78 (OS Command Injection).",1318,86,3.473437786102295
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 as it does not involve constructing file paths from external input. Instead, it processes a file named ""bs-extensions"" that is retrieved from a config object, which is not user-supplied data.",950,61,2.4394524097442627
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE. It is a separate function for a game unrelated to the FastAPI issue.,1623,38,1.6790008544921875
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE. The code is for a game function, not related to the validation of agent data or authentication schemes.",983,45,1.9120025634765625
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code does not contain an infinite loop, and it is not vulnerable to CWE-835. The code is parsing incoming data and processing it, and it has proper exit conditions in place. The sumGame function is unrelated to the data_received function and does not contain any infinite loops or other vulnerabilities.",1194,72,2.9076716899871826
87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that is inconsistent with how the messages will be processed by the ultimate destination. Instead, it simply extracts information from a dictionary-like object and constructs a new dictionary with some modifications.",1978,90,3.6727333068847656
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter passed to the _get_unauth_response function. The vulnerable line is: error_params = urlencode({""error"": force_text(reason)})

This line constructs an error_params string by encoding the user-supplied reason parameter without proper validation or encoding. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the reason parameter, which will be reflected back in the error message and executed in the victim's browser when they visit the page.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and encode the reason parameter before using it in the error message or URL. This can be done using a library like Django's built-in escape filter or a similar library for other web frameworks.",2248,188,7.508214235305786
89,CWE-22," NO. The given Python code does not involve file operations and is not related to the described vulnerability (CWE-22). It is a function for a game called ""sumGame"" that takes a string as an argument and returns a boolean value based on certain conditions.",999,57,2.299384117126465
90,CWE-22," NO. The given Python code does not involve file operations and is not related to the described vulnerability (CWE-22). It is a function for a game called ""sumGame"" that takes a string as an argument and returns a boolean value based on certain conditions.",992,57,2.293966293334961
91,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or sending user-controlled URLs or similar requests. Instead, it is a function for determining the outcome of a game based on a string input.",993,57,2.285693645477295
92,CWE-22," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it is a function for a sum game logic.",1045,53,2.159954309463501
93,CWE-22," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it is a function for a sum game logic.",1038,53,2.1544010639190674
94,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled URLs or similar requests. Instead, it defines a function `swaggerui_static` for serving static files and another unrelated function `sumGame` for a number game.",1039,67,2.6810905933380127
95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users. Instead, it is a function for testing the rendering of custom fields in a table, and the input is hardcoded and not user-supplied.",2627,73,3.1464247703552246
96,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CWE-918 description provided.
