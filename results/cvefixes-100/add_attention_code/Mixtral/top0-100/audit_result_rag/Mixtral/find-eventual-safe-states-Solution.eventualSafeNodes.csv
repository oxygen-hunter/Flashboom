Therefore, the provided code does not directly relate to the described vulnerability.",1605,136,5.402354717254639
68,CWE-601," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-601 as it does not involve accepting a user-controlled input and redirecting to an external site. Instead, it sets up a homeserver and returns it.",830,52,2.1227221488952637
69,CWE-93, NO. The given code does not use CRLF sequences as special elements and does not handle user inputs directly. It is a helper function for a depth-first search algorithm and does not have any vulnerabilities related to CWE-93.,558,51,2.021371364593506
70,CWE-93, NO. The given code does not use CRLF sequences as special elements and does not process user input in a way that could lead to CRLF injection attacks. The code is a depth-first search implementation for finding safe nodes in a graph.,516,52,2.0514092445373535
71,CWE-93, NO. The given code does not use CRLF sequences as special elements and does not handle user inputs directly. It only defines a helper function `append` and another function `eventualSafeNodes` that takes a list as an argument and performs a depth-first search on a graph.,562,60,2.3737051486968994
72,CWE-93," NO. The given code does not use CRLF sequences as special elements and does not process user input containing CRLF sequences. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-93.",561,41,1.6478114128112793
73,CWE-93," NO. The given code does not use CRLF sequences as special elements and does not handle user inputs. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-93.",554,36,1.453716516494751
74,CWE-79," YES, the code is vulnerable to CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting) due to the lack of input validation and sanitization on the 'bad_url' and 'good_url' variables. The code constructs URLs based on user-supplied data without checking if the data is safe, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.",2484,77,3.3338027000427246
75,CWE-918," The given code for `_delete_user` function is not directly related to the `eventualSafeNodes` function provided. Therefore, I cannot directly evaluate the vulnerability of the `_delete_user` function based on the information given.

However, I can tell you that the `_delete_user` function appears to be deleting user data based on user input (`content`). If this input is not properly sanitized or validated, it could potentially lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, as described in the CVE and CWE descriptions provided.

Therefore, the answer is:

YES, the `_delete_user` function is potentially vulnerable to SSRF attacks if the user input is not properly sanitized or validated.",1909,170,6.800723314285278
76,CWE-284," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of access control checks when deleting a user. The code only checks if the user is an admin and if the user being deleted is not the Guest user. However, it does not check if the user making the request is the actual admin or not. This means that any unauthorized user could potentially delete an admin user, leading to a security vulnerability. This issue falls under the CWE-284 category, as described in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions.",2051,115,4.655360460281372
77,CWE-918, NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it is making a request to a known and trusted source (Dropbox) and is not modifying the URL in a way that could lead to SSRF attacks. The second function provided is not related to the vulnerability and is just a separate function for graph traversal.,750,76,3.0712640285491943
78,CWE-116," Yes, it is vulnerable. The issue is that the `plugin_names` argument is concatenated with the command string using the `join()` method without any form of escaping. This means that if an attacker supplies malicious input for `plugin_names`, it could potentially be executed as part of the shell command.

For example, if `plugin_names` is set to `[""rm"", ""-rf"", ""/etc/passwd""]`, the resulting command would be `rm -rf /etc/passwd`, which would delete the `/etc/passwd` file on the target system.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `plugin_names` argument should be properly escaped before being added to the command string. One way to do this would be to use a quoting mechanism such as `shlex.quote()` to escape any special characters in the input. For example:

```python
import shlex

#...

self.cmdline_args.append(shlex.quote("" "".join(plugin_names)))
```

This would ensure that any special characters in the `plugin_names` argument are properly escaped and will not be interpreted as part of the shell command.",1469,262,10.178081035614014
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it checks for the presence of a session and adapts the label of a LoginButton based on the user's session information.",983,64,2.564340829849243
80,CWE-601," NO. The given code does not contain any open redirect vulnerability as it does not redirect to a user-controlled input. Instead, it redirects to the 'next' parameter or the topic's absolute URL, which are not user-controllable.",1042,55,2.2730021476745605
81,CWE-264," Yes, it is vulnerable to token chaining attack as described in CVE-2012-3426 and CWE-264. The code does not properly implement token expiration and allows remote authenticated users to create new tokens through token chaining.",3292,59,2.9124550819396973
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not construct or modify OS commands using externally-influenced input. Instead, it uses the exec() function to execute a string of Python code, but this does not allow for arbitrary OS command execution.",1043,61,2.5543394088745117
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths from external input. Instead, it defines a function `load` that retrieves and executes a boilerplate file, but the file name is hardcoded and comes from a config object, which is not user-supplied input. Therefore, there is no path traversal vulnerability present in the code.",675,98,3.7840688228607178
84,CWE-352," NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-352 as it is not related to handling user requests or parsing JSON data. Instead, it is a function for finding safe nodes in a graph using Depth-First Search algorithm.",1348,52,2.180340528488159
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input or data from an untrusted source in the same way as the provided vulnerable code.

86,CWE-835," The given code for `data_received` function is not directly related to the `eventualSafeNodes` function, so I cannot evaluate its vulnerability based on the provided information. However, I can tell you that the `data_received` function appears to be vulnerable based on the previous code snippet provided. The reason is that it contains an infinite loop, as described in the CWE-835 description. The loop condition `while self._buffer:` cannot be reached if an exception is raised inside the loop, leading to an infinite loop and potential resource consumption.",919,120,4.638895750045776
87,CWE-444," Based on the given code, the function `_parse_video` is not directly vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities. It is simply extracting information from a dictionary and returning a new dictionary. However, if the `smuggle_url` function is vulnerable to CWE-444, then the `_parse_video` function could be indirectly vulnerable as it uses `smuggle_url`. It would be best to review the implementation of `smuggle_url` to determine if it is vulnerable.",1703,130,5.135557651519775
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error URL.
