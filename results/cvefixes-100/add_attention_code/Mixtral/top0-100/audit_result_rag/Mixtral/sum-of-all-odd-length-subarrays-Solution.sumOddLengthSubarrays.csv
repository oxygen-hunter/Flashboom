Instead, it performs various database queries and deletions related to the local 'ub' session.",2116,65,2.908400058746338
76,CWE-284," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper access control checks. The `_delete_user` function deletes a user and all associated data if the following condition is met:

1. The query returns at least one user with the role of 'admin'.
2. The user to be deleted is not 'Guest'.

However, there is no check to ensure that the user calling the function is an admin user. This means that any user can call this function and delete other users, including admin users, if there is only one admin user left. This is a clear violation of the principle of least privilege and can lead to unintended consequences.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to CWE-284: Improper Access Control. To mitigate this vulnerability, you should add a check to ensure that the calling user is an admin user before deleting a user.",2258,197,7.783877372741699
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve making HTTP requests to user-supplied URLs. Instead, it is a function for calculating the number of odd-length subarrays in a given list.",957,58,2.379326820373535
78,CWE-116," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-116 as it does not involve constructing or passing shell commands. Instead, it constructs a list of command-line arguments and appends them to a list, which is then used to execute a command using the operating system's command-line interface. There is no evidence of user input being directly incorporated into the command, which is a common vulnerability associated with CWE-116.",1676,99,3.9982471466064453
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it is a function for calculating the number of odd-length subarrays in a given list.",1190,58,2.4325754642486572
80,CWE-601," NO. The given code does not contain any functionality that would allow for an attacker to redirect the request to a malicious site. The code only performs data validation and updates the database, and then renders a template. There is no redirection to an external URL based on user-controlled input.",1249,63,2.5713906288146973
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration and allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens or leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account or an account with a changed password. The code does not check the validity or expiration of the tokens being used for authentication.",3499,82,3.6674230098724365
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not involve constructing or executing OS commands using externally-influenced input. Instead, it defines a Python function and calculates the sum of odd-length subarrays in a given list using that function.",1250,64,2.645233154296875
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths from external input. Instead, it defines a function `sumOddLengthSubarrays` that calculates the sum of the number of odd length subarrays for each number in a given list.",882,74,2.925869941711426
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE-2021-32677 and CWE-352. It is a function for calculating the number of odd-length subarrays in a given list.,1555,58,2.440372943878174
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE. The code is for a function `validate_agent_data` that validates JSON data, and another function `sumOddLengthSubarrays` that calculates the sum of the number of odd-length subarrays of a given list. There is no evidence of unsanitized data handling or authentication scheme implementation that could lead to spoofing attacks as described in the CVE and CWE.",915,109,4.323956727981567
86,CWE-835, NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-835 as it does not contain an infinite loop. The code is parsing incoming data and checking if it is complete before proceeding to the next iteration of the while loop.,1126,50,2.0608913898468018
87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that is inconsistent with how the messages will be processed by the ultimate destination. Instead, it is a Python function that processes a video dictionary and returns a dictionary with some video metadata.",1910,88,3.5969202518463135
88,CWE-79," The given code for the function `_get_unauth_response` is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the error message passed as the `reason` parameter is not properly escaped before being included in the response. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the error message, which is then reflected back to the user in the response.

The `sumOddLengthSubarrays` function is not related to the vulnerability in the `_get_unauth_response` function and is not vulnerable on its own.",2180,129,5.21393346786499
89,CWE-22," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it is a function for calculating the number of odd-length subarrays in a given list.",931,64,2.569706916809082

94,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in a way that could lead to server-side request forgery (SSRF).

95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users.

98,CWE-918, NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CWE-918 description provided. The code is handling user input (book_format_from and book_format_to) and using it to construct a local file path for the convert_book_format function call. There is no evidence of the code making external HTTP requests or allowing user-supplied URLs to be constructed.,1448,98,3.9150407314300537
99,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CWE-918 description provided. The code is not making any external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs, so there is no opportunity for an attacker to manipulate the server into making requests to unexpected hosts or ports.
