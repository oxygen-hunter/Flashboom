73,CWE-93, NO. The given code does not appear to use CRLF sequences as special elements and does not handle them in a way that could lead to a CRLF attack. The code is focused on implementing Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the minimum cost of reaching each node in a graph with given road costs and apple costs.,696,68,2.734274387359619
74,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation and sanitization of the 'bad_url' and 'good_url' variables in the 'test_security_check' function. The code constructs URLs by interpolating these variables into a template string, which can result in the execution of malicious JavaScript code if the variables contain malicious input. This is an example of reflected XSS vulnerability.",2626,96,4.010110855102539
75,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests based on user input. Instead, it only performs database queries and deletions based on the user ID provided as an argument.",2051,57,2.462364912033081
76,CWE-284," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of access control checks when deleting a user. The code only checks if there is an admin user other than the one being deleted and if the user being deleted is not ""Guest"". However, it does not check if the user making the request has the necessary permissions to delete a user. This can allow unauthorized users to delete other users.",2193,87,3.658413887023926

78,CWE-116," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-116 as it does not involve constructing a shell command from user input. Instead, it constructs a list of command-line arguments and appends them to a list, which is then appended to a fixed list containing the Ansible document executable path. There is no evidence of user input being directly incorporated into the command string.",1611,87,3.5200979709625244
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs.

80,CWE-601, NO. The given code does not contain any functionality that would allow for an attacker to redirect the request to a malicious site. The code only performs database updates and renders a template.,1184,40,1.729085922241211
81,CWE-264," The given code for the `authenticate` function is similar to the vulnerable code provided in the question, but there are some differences that make it less vulnerable.

First, the code checks if the user is disabled before creating a new token. This helps prevent unauthorized access even if an attacker manages to obtain a token for a disabled user.

Second, the code uses the `dijkstra` function to find the minimum cost of reaching each apple location from a given starting point. This function does not appear to have any security vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'. The code for the `authenticate` function is not vulnerable to the CWE-264 weakness.",3434,150,6.165454387664795
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not involve constructing or executing OS commands using externally-influenced input. Instead, it defines a local function `dijkstra` and uses it to calculate the minimum cost to reach each node in a graph represented by the `adj` list. The `load` function retrieves and executes a boilerplate file, but it does not involve OS command injection.",1185,98,3.9114818572998047
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 as it does not involve constructing file paths from external input. Instead, it defines a graph and performs a Dijkstra's algorithm on it.",817,49,1.9721765518188477

85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input or data from an untrusted source in the same way as the code in the CVE description. Instead, it is using JSON data that is assumed to be valid and is being processed using the json.loads() function. Additionally, the code is not related to authentication schemes or spoofing attacks as described in the CWE description.",850,95,3.7795557975769043
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for the function `data_received` does not contain an infinite loop as described in the CWE-835 vulnerability. The loop in the code exits when the condition `while self._buffer:` is no longer met, which can be reached when the buffer is empty. Additionally, the provided code for the function `minCost` is not related to the vulnerability and does not contain an infinite loop either.",1061,93,3.7126166820526123
87,CWE-444," The given code for `_parse_video` function does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities. It is simply extracting information from a dictionary-like object `video` and returning a dictionary. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",1845,73,3.026867389678955
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error URL.

95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users.
