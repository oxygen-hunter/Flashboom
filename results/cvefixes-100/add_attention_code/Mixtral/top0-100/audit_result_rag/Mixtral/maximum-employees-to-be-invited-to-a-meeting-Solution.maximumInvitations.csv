1,CWE-918," The given code for the function `get_response` is not directly related to the `maximumInvitations` function, so I cannot evaluate its vulnerability based on this code alone. However, I will provide an answer for the `get_response` function based on the information provided in the context of the CVE description.

YES, the `get_response` function is vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks as described in the CVE description. The function makes an HTTP request to the given URL using the `requests` library, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

76,CWE-284," The given code for `_delete_user` function is not directly related to the `maximumInvitations` function provided. Therefore, I cannot directly evaluate the vulnerability of the `_delete_user` function based on the given information.

However, I can provide some general information about the vulnerability CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) and how it might apply to the `_delete_user` function based on the provided code.

The `_delete_user` function appears to delete various data associated with a user when certain conditions are met. The conditions for deletion include the user having the `ROLE_ADMIN` role and the user not being ""Guest"". If these conditions are not met, the function does not delete the user data.

The potential vulnerability in this function could be that an attacker could potentially bypass the access control checks and delete a user that they should not be able to delete. For example, an attacker could exploit a vulnerability in the authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to the system and then use the `_delete_user` function to delete other users' data.

Without more information about the specific implementation of the authentication and authorization mechanisms, it is difficult to determine if this vulnerability exists in the `_delete_user` function. However, it is important to ensure that proper access control mechanisms are in place to prevent",2240,301,11.633373737335205

81,CWE-264," The given code for the `authenticate` function is similar to the vulnerable code provided earlier, but with some differences. The main difference is that the code does not seem to have the issue of not checking for token expiration, which is the root cause of the vulnerability in the original code.

However, the code still has some potential issues related to the authentication flow and the use of `uuid.uuid4().hex` for generating tokens. These issues are not directly related to the CWE-264 vulnerability, but they could still pose a security risk.

For instance, the code does not seem to have any checks on the input `auth` parameter, which could potentially allow an attacker to pass malicious data to the function. Additionally, the use of `uuid.uuid4().hex` for generating tokens could lead to predictable token values, which could be exploited by an attacker.

Based on the given code, it is not clear whether these issues are present or not, as the code provided is incomplete and does not include the necessary context to make a definitive assessment.

Therefore, I would recommend a more thorough analysis of the codebase and the authentication flow to ensure that all potential vulnerabilities are addressed.

88,CWE-79," The given code for the function `_get_unauth_response` is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the error message, which is then reflected back to the user's browser and executed.

Therefore, the answer is 'YES' and the reason is that the code does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.",2162,145,5.834723472595215
