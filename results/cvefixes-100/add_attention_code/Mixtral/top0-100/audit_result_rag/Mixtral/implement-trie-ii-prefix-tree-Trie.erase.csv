75,CWE-918," The given Python code for `_delete_user` function is not directly related to the provided CVE-2022-0339 and CWE-918 description. The `_delete_user` function is deleting user data based on given user id and checks if the user is an admin or not. It doesn't involve any URL or similar request that could be used for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'. The `_delete_user` function is not vulnerable to CWE-918 or SSRF attacks based on the provided code.",1892,137,5.453299045562744
76,CWE-284," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of access control checks when deleting a user. An attacker who is not an admin user can delete any user by calling the _delete_user function with a valid user ID. This can lead to unauthorized deletion of user data and compromise of the system.

The code does not check the role or privileges of the user calling the _delete_user function before deleting the user. This is a violation of the authorization mechanism, which is a part of access control. The code only checks if there is an admin user remaining and if the user to be deleted is not the ""Guest"" user. However, it does not check if the calling user is an admin user or not.

Therefore, an attacker who gains access to the system can call the _delete_user function with a valid user ID and delete any user, including admin users, leading to a compromise of the system.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to gain privileges, read sensitive information, execute commands, or evade detection, among other things. This is a clear example of a CWE-284 vulnerability, as described in the CWE description provided.",2034,265,10.384708166122437
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve making a request to an untrusted source based on user input. Instead, it makes a request to a known Dropbox link, which is generated by the application itself using a trusted function.",733,63,2.5020580291748047
78,CWE-116," Yes, it is vulnerable. The issue is that the `plugin_names` argument is concatenated with the command line arguments without proper escaping. This could allow an attacker to inject shell commands into the command executed on the host.

For example, if `plugin_names` is set to `""../etc/passwd""; rm -rf /`, the command executed on the host would be `ansible-runner /path/to/ansible-runner../etc/passwd -j -s -t plugin_type --playbook-dir playbook_dir -M module_path /etc/passwd; rm -rf /`, which would execute the `rm -rf /` command on the host.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `plugin_names` argument should be properly escaped before being added to the command line arguments. One way to do this is to use a library or function that safely quotes the argument, such as the `shlex.quote()` function in Python. For example:

```python
self.cmdline_args.append(shlex.quote("" "".join(plugin_names)))
```

This would ensure that any special characters in the `plugin_names` argument are properly escaped and will not be interpreted as shell commands.",1452,276,10.751688003540039
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it checks the session data of an incoming request to determine the user's login status.",966,55,2.219244956970215
80,CWE-601, NO. The given code does not contain any functionality that would allow for a user-controlled input to be used in a redirect. The code only performs database updates and renders a template. The `redirect` function call is not influenced by user input.,1025,53,2.1591665744781494

82,CWE-78," YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-78 (OS Command Injection). The vulnerability arises from the use of the `exec()` function, which executes the given code string as Python code.

86,CWE-835," The given code for the function `data_received` is vulnerable. The reason is that the while loop at the beginning of the function, which attempts to parse incoming data, does not have a clear exit condition.
