However, I will evaluate the `add_security_headers(resp)` function based on the given description and CVE-ID/CWE-ID.

Answer: YES

Reason: The `add_security_headers(resp)` function is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks due to the dynamic construction of the `Content-Security-Policy` header. The function concatenates trusted hosts to the header, which can be manipulated by an attacker to include malicious URLs.

70,CWE-93," NO. The given Python code does not use CRLF sequences as special elements and does not process user input, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-93.",428,36,1.442713975906372
71,CWE-93," NO. The given code does not use CRLF sequences as special elements and does not handle user inputs. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-93.",474,36,1.442751407623291
72,CWE-93, NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-93 as it does not involve handling of CRLF sequences or any special character sequences. It is only a method to filter out keys from a dictionary.,473,48,1.935208797454834
73,CWE-93," NO. The given code does not appear to handle CRLF sequences in a way that could lead to a vulnerability as described in the CVE or CWE descriptions provided. The code only defines a `replace` method that updates a dictionary with string values, and a `printLinkedListInReverse` method that prints the values of nodes in a linked list in reverse order. There is no evidence of any input being processed in a way that could lead to a CRLF attack.",466,102,3.93080997467041
74,CWE-79," YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting). The vulnerability arises from the lack of input validation and sanitization of the 'bad_url' and 'good_url' variables. The code constructs URLs by interpolating these variables into a template string, without checking if they contain any malicious content. An attacker could exploit this by providing a URL containing malicious scripts, which would be executed when the URL is visited by the user. This could lead to various types of attacks, such as data theft, unauthorized access, or even takeover of the user's account.",2396,137,5.548600196838379
75,CWE-918," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The issue lies in the fact that the code deletes records based on user input (content.id) without sufficient input validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially provide a malicious URL as the user ID, causing the application to make unintended requests and perform unauthorized actions. In this specific case, the code deletes various records related to a user, which could lead to data leakage or unauthorized access if an attacker is able to successfully execute an SSRF attack.",1821,123,4.944974184036255
76,CWE-284," YES, the code is vulnerable to CWE-284 because it does not properly restrict access to the user deletion functionality. The code checks if there is an admin user present in the system before deleting a user, but it does not check if the user making the request is an admin user. This means that any user can delete other users, including admin users, if there is no admin user present in the system. This is a specification issue in access control.",1963,99,4.041481971740723
77,CWE-918," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the fact that the `recipe.link` is being constructed by concatenating a hardcoded string with the `Dropbox.get_share_link(recipe)` response, which can potentially contain malicious URLs. An attacker can manipulate the `Dropbox.get_share_link(recipe)` response to include a malicious URL, which will then be fetched and executed by the `requests.get()` function. This can lead to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, as described in the CVE and CWE descriptions provided.",662,138,5.372729539871216
78,CWE-116," Based on the given code, the `prepare_plugin_docs_command` function does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-116 (Improper Escaping of Input). The function is constructing a command line argument list and appending it to the command that will be executed. There is no evidence that user-supplied data is being directly included in the command without proper escaping or encoding.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",1381,97,3.870734453201294
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it checks for the presence of a session variable and constructs a label based on that information.",895,56,2.254120111465454
80,CWE-601," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-601 Open Redirection as it does not involve redirecting the user to a user-controlled URL. Instead, it redirects the user to the 'next' parameter or the topic's absolute URL.",954,61,2.4410955905914307
81,CWE-264," Yes, it is vulnerable to CWE-264, token mismanagement. The code does not properly check the expiration or revocation status of the tokens being used for authentication, allowing unauthorized access to resources. This can lead to unintended authorization restrictions being bypassed, as described in the CVE-2012-3426 vulnerability.",3204,80,3.5653421878814697
82,CWE-78," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The `exec` function executes the given code as if it were part of the Python interpreter, which means that any code retrieved from an untrusted source can execute arbitrary OS commands. In this case, the `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile` function is retrieving code from an untrusted source, so an attacker could potentially inject and execute OS commands through this function. This is an example of the second subtype of OS command injection described in the CWE description, where the application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run.",955,129,5.142505884170532
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve handling file paths or external input in a way that could allow an attacker to traverse outside of the intended directory. Instead, it is a function for printing a linked list in reverse order.",587,68,2.654402256011963
84,CWE-352," NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE. It is a test function for FastAPI that checks for error responses when sending malformed JSON data. The vulnerability described in the CVE is related to FastAPI versions lower than 0.65.2 accepting and parsing text/plain content as JSON, which can lead to CSRF attacks. The given code does not have this behavior.",1260,94,3.72529673576355
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input or external data in an unsanitized manner. Instead, it is validating JSON data and checking the format of regular expressions, which does not directly relate to CWE-290.",620,66,2.586787223815918
86,CWE-835," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to an infinite loop in the following section of code:

while curr.getNext()!= tail:
curr = curr.getNext()

This loop will continue indefinitely if 'tail' is never assigned a value. If an attacker can manipulate the 'tail' variable, they could cause this infinite loop to consume excessive resources.

However, in the given code, the 'printLinkedListInReverse' function does not contain any code that could cause 'tail' to never be assigned a value. Therefore, this function is not vulnerable on its own. But, the 'data_received' function is vulnerable as explained above.",831,152,5.838606834411621
87,CWE-444," Yes, the code is vulnerable. The issue is that the `smuggle_url` function call allows for the passing of arbitrary `http_headers`, which can be used by an attacker to smuggle malicious headers to the ultimate destination (in this case, the Vimeo server). This could potentially lead to unintended actions on the server, such as cookie exfiltration or other forms of data leakage. The use of the `smuggle_url` function in this way is inconsistent with how the messages will be processed by the Vimeo server, and can allow an adversary to smuggle a message to the server without the intermediary (the Python code) being aware of it.",1615,153,5.974732160568237
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error URL. The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code in the ""reason"" parameter, which will be reflected back in the URL and executed by the victim's browser when they visit the page.",1885,82,3.4056005477905273

95,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, specifically Reflected XSS. The vulnerability arises from the use of `mark_safe()` or its equivalent `format_html()` in the rendering of user-controllable data, such as the `col_expected_value` in the `custom_column_expected` dictionary.

The `mark_safe()` function in Django is used to mark a string as safe for inclusion in an HTML context. However, when the string contains user-controllable data, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities if the data is not properly sanitized. In this case, the data is coming directly from the user and is being rendered without any checks or sanitization.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `col_expected_value` dictionary, which would then be rendered as part of the HTML response and executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as stealing sensitive information, performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user, or even taking control of the user's machine.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the user-controllable data should be properly sanitized before being rendered in the HTML response. This can be done using Django's built-in functions like `escapejs()` or",2264,301,11.661192655563354
