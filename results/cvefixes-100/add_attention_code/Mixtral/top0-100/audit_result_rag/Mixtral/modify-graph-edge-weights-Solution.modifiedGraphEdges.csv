The code makes an HTTP request to the given URL using the requests library without sufficient input validation or access control checks.

84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE. It is a separate function for graph algorithms and does not involve handling HTTP requests or parsing JSON data.,1586,43,1.9615797996520996
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input or data from an untrusted source in a way that could lead to spoofing attacks. Instead, it is validating JSON data and calling a function `config.valid_exclude_list()` to validate regular expressions, which does not involve any unsanitized data handling that could lead to the vulnerability described in the CVE.",946,98,3.8966879844665527
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code does not contain an infinite loop, as the condition in the while loop is that self._buffer is not empty. The loop exits once all data in self._buffer has been processed. The code for modifiedGraphEdges function is not related to the vulnerability and does not contain an infinite loop either.",1157,68,2.7430524826049805
87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that is inconsistent with how the ultimate destination entities will process them. Instead, it simply constructs and returns a dictionary with video metadata.",1941,79,3.2994658946990967
88,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks as it does not dynamically generate web pages with user-controllable input that is not properly escaped. Instead, it generates error messages and redirects users to a login page with error parameters. These error messages and redirects do not contain user-controllable input that could be executed as code by a web browser.",2211,89,3.7004780769348145
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations and does not construct file paths using user-controlled input, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or any other file-related vulnerabilities.",962,50,2.0462934970855713
90,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not involve file operations and is not related to the described vulnerability (CWE-22). It is a function for graph algorithms.,955,35,1.469867467880249
91,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve sending user-controlled data to external resources without proper validation. Instead, it is a standalone function that performs graph manipulation using local data.",956,55,2.221735954284668
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a predefined directory structure and does not allow for user input to traverse outside of the intended directory.",1008,65,2.6160190105438232
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it is a graph algorithm implementation.",1001,49,2.056072473526001
94,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled URLs or similar requests. Instead, it is a standalone function for modifying graph edges using Dijkstra's algorithm.",1002,57,2.2847115993499756
95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users. Instead, it is a function for modifying graph edges using Dijkstra's algorithm.",2590,61,2.687232494354248
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it only deals with internal database queries and object manipulation.",1611,55,2.3209123611450195
97,CWE-918, NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions. The code only performs database operations based on user input and does not make any external HTTP requests or handle URLs in a way that could be exploited for SSRF attacks.,1611,71,2.910670757293701
98,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests using user-supplied data. Instead, it processes form data internally and calls helper functions with predefined arguments.",1479,56,2.3338046073913574
99,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it processes form data and calls internal functions.",1479,52,2.1739389896392822
100,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it focuses on internal database operations and file handling.",2007,53,2.287932872772217
