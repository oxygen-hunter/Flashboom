74,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation and sanitization of the 'bad_url' and 'good_url' variables. The code constructs URLs by interpolating these variables into a template string, without checking if they are safe or not. This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if an attacker provides malicious URLs containing scripts that can be executed in the context of the web application.",2577,102,4.332338809967041
75,CWE-918," The given code for the function `_delete_user` is not directly related to the function `maxNiceDivisors`. Therefore, I cannot evaluate the vulnerability of the `_delete_user` function based on the given code for `maxNiceDivisors`.

However, I can tell you that the `_delete_user` function is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks as described in the CWE-918 vulnerability. The function retrieves user data based on user ID, and it does not sufficiently ensure that the user ID is coming from a trusted source. An attacker could potentially provide a malicious user ID to delete other users' data or access internal resources.

Therefore, the answer is 'YES' and the vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation and insufficient access control checks in the `_delete_user` function.",2002,193,7.651731252670288
76,CWE-284," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper access control checks. In the function `_delete_user`, the code deletes a user and all associated data if the following condition is met:

1. The query returns at least one user with the role of 'admin'.
2. The user to be deleted is not 'Guest'.

However, there is no check to ensure that the user calling the function is an admin user. This means that any user can call this function and delete other users, including admin users, as long as there is at least one admin user in the system. This is a clear violation of the principle of least privilege and can lead to unintended consequences.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to CWE-284: Improper Access Control. To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should be modified to ensure that only admin users can call the `_delete_user` function. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that the calling user is an admin user before performing the deletion.",2144,230,9.07757043838501
