76,CWE-284," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of access control checks when deleting a user. The code only checks if there is an admin user other than the one being deleted and if the user being deleted is not ""Guest"". However, it does not check if the user making the request has the necessary permissions to delete a user. This can allow unauthorized users to delete other users.",2200,87,3.7451136112213135
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server Side Request Forgery) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests using user-supplied data. Instead, it uses a Dropbox API call to obtain a share link, which is then used to make a request to the Dropbox server. There is no way for an attacker to manipulate the request target or protocol, as the request is being made directly to the Dropbox server and not through the Python code.",899,107,4.2384889125823975
78,CWE-116," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-116 as it does not involve constructing or passing shell commands. Instead, it constructs a list of command-line arguments and appends them to a list, which is then appended to a list containing the executable path before being executed. This is not the same as constructing a shell command string and executing it directly.",1618,86,3.4753944873809814
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it is a function for checking the login status of a user and adapting the label of a LoginButton based on the user's session information.",1132,68,2.7245023250579834
80,CWE-601, NO. The given code does not contain any functionality that would allow for an open redirect vulnerability as described in the CWE-601 description. The code is for a topic moderation function and does not involve any user-controlled input that could be used to redirect the request to a malicious site.,1191,65,2.626765251159668
81,CWE-264," The given code for the `authenticate` function is similar to the vulnerable code provided in the question, but there are some differences that make it less vulnerable.

First, the code checks if the user is disabled before creating a new token. This helps prevent unauthorized access even if an attacker manages to obtain a token for a disabled user.

Second, the code uses the `get_tenants_for_user` method to check if the tenant provided in the request is valid for the user. This helps prevent unauthorized access to tenants that the user is not authorized to access.

Based on these observations, the answer is 'NO'. The code is not vulnerable to the CWE-264 weakness described in the question.",3441,158,6.553136587142944
82,CWE-78," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the execution of arbitrary code using the `exec()` function. The code being executed is retrieved from an untrusted source (`config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`), making it susceptible to CWE-78 (OS Command Injection).",1192,78,3.120635509490967
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve handling file paths or external input in a way that could allow an attacker to traverse outside of a restricted directory. Instead, it is a function for graph traversal problem.",824,65,2.6164746284484863
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the web application vulnerability described in CWE-352. It is a separate function for graph traversal problem.,1497,35,1.5571527481079102
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be related to the validation of agent data or any authentication scheme. It is a separate function for collecting coins in a graph problem. Therefore, it does not have any vulnerability related to CWE-290 or log spoofing.",857,59,2.392540454864502
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for the function `data_received` does not contain an infinite loop as described in the CWE-835 vulnerability. The loop in the code exits when the buffer does not contain enough data to form a complete message, or when an exception is raised during message parsing.",1068,66,2.635596752166748
87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to act as an intermediary HTTP agent and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that could allow for smuggling attacks as described in the CWE-444 description. Instead, it is processing a dictionary-like object called 'video' and extracting specific values from it to construct a return dictionary.",1852,78,3.2554874420166016
88,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the URL with urlencode(). This can allow an attacker to inject and execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser.",2122,67,2.8612866401672363
89,CWE-22," NO. The given Python code does not involve file operations and does not construct file paths based on user-controlled input, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or any other file-related vulnerabilities.",873,52,2.10541033744812
90,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations and does not construct file paths based on user-controlled input, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or any other file-related vulnerabilities.",866,51,2.0557281970977783
91,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or constructing URLs or similar request destinations. Instead, it defines a function for a graph algorithm and does not involve any network requests or file handling using user-controlled input.",867,64,2.5422770977020264
92,CWE-22," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded path to the Flask-RESTX static files using os.path.join() function.",919,69,2.7673890590667725
93,CWE-22," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input.

94,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in a way that could lead to server-side request forgery (SSRF). Instead, it is a standalone function for calculating the number of coins in a graph problem.",913,68,2.7477288246154785
95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users. Instead, it is a function for processing and comparing expected and actual values of custom columns in a table, and does not involve any web page rendering or user input.",2501,75,3.1720399856567383
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions.
