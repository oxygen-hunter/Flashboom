77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server Side Request Forgery) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests using user-supplied data. Instead, it focuses on finding combinations of numbers and calculating their counts.",1190,57,2.3631927967071533
78,CWE-116," NO. The given code does not construct a command from user-supplied input without proper encoding or escaping, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-116. Instead, it constructs a list of arguments to be appended to a predefined command, which is then executed using the os.execvp() function, which properly handles command line arguments.",1909,76,3.1813299655914307
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it deals with string manipulation and finding the longest common prefix of a list of strings.",1423,55,2.2987279891967773
80,CWE-601," NO. The given Python code does not contain any redirect functionality based on user-controlled input, making it not vulnerable to CWE-601 (Open Redirect). Instead, it focuses on handling Topic objects and their attributes.",1482,50,2.1309926509857178
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to token chaining attack as described in CVE-2012-3426 and CWE-264. The code does not properly implement token expiration, allowing remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining.",3732,68,3.13899302482605
82,CWE-78," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the use of `exec()` function which executes the given code as a part of the current Python script. Since the code being executed is retrieved from an external source (`config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`), it can potentially contain arbitrary OS commands, leading to OS command injection.",1483,85,3.4448347091674805
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve handling file paths or external input in a way that could allow an attacker to traverse outside of a restricted directory. Instead, it defines and calculates combinations of strings, and does not interact with the file system.",1115,73,3.0151591300964355
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE-2021-32677 and CWE-352. It is a Python function for finding the number of combinations of a given string.,1788,53,2.2728209495544434
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not related to authentication or spoofing attacks. Instead, it is a function for finding the number of combinations of a given string.",1148,49,2.031822681427002
86,CWE-835, NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-835 as it does not contain an infinite loop. The code is parsing incoming data and checking for sufficient data to form a complete message before proceeding to the next iteration of the loop.,1359,53,2.209381580352783
87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that is inconsistent with how the messages will be processed by the ultimate destination. Instead, it simply extracts information from a dictionary-like object and returns it in a new dictionary.",2143,88,3.716867446899414
88,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the URL query string. The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code in the ""reason"" parameter, which will be reflected back in the URL and executed by the victim's browser when they visit the page.",2413,84,3.6113462448120117
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations and does not construct file paths using user-controlled input, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or any other file-related vulnerabilities.",1164,50,2.0682883262634277
90,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations and does not construct file paths based on user-controlled input, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or CVE-2023-50265.",1157,57,2.367284059524536
91,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve sending user-controlled data to external resources without proper validation. Instead, it is a function for calculating the number of combinations of a given string.",1158,56,2.276350736618042
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded path to the Flask-RESTX static directory.",1210,60,2.453942060470581
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not construct a pathname using user-controlled input and does not appear to be vulnerable to path traversal attacks. Instead, it defines several functions for finding the longest common prefix of a list of strings and calculating the number of combinations based on that prefix.",1203,60,2.4543979167938232
94,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in a way that could lead to server-side request forgery (SSRF).

95,CWE-79," The given code for the function `test_custom_field_table_render` is not vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks as described in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions. The reason is that the code does not involve user-controllable input being placed in output that is used as a web page served to other users. Instead, the code is testing the rendering of expected values for custom columns in a table, and it is not generating or serving web pages to other users. Therefore, there is no opportunity for malicious script injection or violation of the same-origin policy.",2792,126,5.239541530609131
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions. The code does not involve retrieving external URLs or similar requests, but rather checks for the existence of elements in a local database and adds new elements if they do not already exist.",1813,72,3.053617238998413
97,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions. The code does not involve retrieving or sending external URLs or requests, and instead focuses on adding new elements to a database based on input.",1813,64,2.686267614364624
98,CWE-918," The given code for `convert_bookformat` function is not vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests using user-supplied data.
