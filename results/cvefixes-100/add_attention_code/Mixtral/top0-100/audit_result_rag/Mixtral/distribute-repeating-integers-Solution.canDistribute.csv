This means that any user can call this function and delete other users, which is a clear violation of the access control principle.",2691,85,3.6358141899108887
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server Side Request Forgery) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests using user-supplied data. Instead, it uses a Dropbox API call to obtain a share link, which is then used to make a request to the Dropbox server. There is no evidence of user-controllable data being used to construct the URL of an external server or protocol.",1390,95,3.868680477142334
78,CWE-116," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-116 as it does not involve constructing or passing shell commands. Instead, it constructs command line arguments for a Python script (ansible-runner) and appends them to a list, which is later used to create a list of elements for the command to be executed. There is no evidence of user input being directly incorporated into the command, which is a common vulnerability scenario for CWE-116.",2109,103,4.2812371253967285
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it is implementing a combinatorial problem solution using dynamic programming.",1623,50,2.1411664485931396
80,CWE-601," NO. The given code does not contain any open redirect vulnerability as it does not use user-controlled input to redirect the request to an external site. Instead, it renders a template and returns a redirect to a predefined URL based on the topic object.",1682,55,2.332366943359375
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration, allowing remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining. The code does not check the expiration of the provided token or the newly created token, which can lead to unintended access to resources.",3932,77,3.5110015869140625
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not construct or modify OS commands using externally-influenced input. Instead, it uses the exec() function to execute a string of Python code, but this does not allow for arbitrary OS command execution.",1683,61,2.5612130165100098
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths from external input. Instead, it uses predefined strings (""bs-extensions"") to retrieve boilerplate files and executes their code in-place.",1315,65,2.6597297191619873
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE descriptions. It is a completely different function that deals with distributing items with given quantities.,1988,39,1.8500807285308838
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input or data from an untrusted source in a way that could lead to log spoofing or other authentication scheme spoofing attacks. Instead, it is validating JSON data and checking regular expressions, which are not susceptible to this type of vulnerability.",1348,79,3.2202773094177246
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for `data_received` function does not contain an infinite loop, and it is not vulnerable to CWE-835. The `canDistribute` function is not related to the vulnerability discussion, and it does not contain an infinite loop either.",1559,60,2.498772621154785
87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to act as an intermediary HTTP agent and does not parse or interpret HTTP messages in a way that could allow for smuggling attacks as described in the CWE-444 description. Instead, it is parsing a dictionary-like object and constructing a return value based on that data.",2343,71,3.095863103866577
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the URL with urlencode(). This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the error message, which will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the page.",2613,78,3.338345527648926
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations and does not construct file paths based on user input, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or CVE-2023-50264.",1364,54,2.285536289215088
90,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations and does not construct file paths based on user input. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or any other file-related vulnerabilities.",1357,49,2.05426025390625
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in the way that would allow for server-side request forgery (SSRF). Instead, it is a complex algorithm for distributing items with certain quantity constraints.",1358,63,2.5917067527770996
92,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not construct a pathname using user-controlled input and does not appear to be vulnerable to path traversal attacks.,1410,31,1.4238226413726807
93,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not construct a pathname using user-controlled input and does not appear to be vulnerable to path traversal attacks.,1403,31,1.3932006359100342
94,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled URLs or similar requests. Instead, it is a separate function for returning a static file using Flask's send_file function.",1404,57,2.3669464588165283
95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users. Instead, it is validating expected values against the output of a database query.",2992,58,2.7102906703948975
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the CWE-918 description provided. The code is not making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs, so there is no risk of unintended server interactions or bypassing access controls.",2013,71,2.9753732681274414
97,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CWE-918 description provided. The code is not making any external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs, so there is no risk of the server being used as a proxy to access unintended destinations.",2013,75,3.1212198734283447
98,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests using user-supplied data. Instead, it processes form data internally and calls helper functions with predefined arguments.",1881,56,2.3984134197235107
99,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests using user-supplied data.
