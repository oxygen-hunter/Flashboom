25,CWE-918," The given Python code for the `list_books()` function is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The vulnerability arises from the way the code constructs SQL queries based on user input, specifically the `sort_param` argument.

The code performs different actions based on the value of `sort_param`, and in some cases, it constructs SQL queries that join multiple tables. If an attacker can manipulate the `sort_param` value, they can potentially inject malicious SQL queries, leading to SSRF vulnerabilities.

For example, an attacker could set `sort_param` to a value that triggers a join with an unexpected table or a table that the attacker has control over. This could allow the attacker to access internal resources, bypass access controls, or perform other unintended actions.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to SSRF attacks due to insufficient input validation and the lack of proper sanitization of user input when constructing SQL queries.",3882,220,9.028323650360107
26,CWE-918," The given Python code for the `list_books()` function is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The vulnerability arises from the way the code constructs SQL queries based on user input, specifically the `sort_param` argument.

The code performs different actions based on the value of `sort_param`, and in some cases, it constructs SQL queries using user input. For example, when `sort_param` is ""tags"", ""series"", ""publishers"", or ""authors"", the code constructs SQL queries with join conditions based on user input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing malicious SQL queries as the value of `sort_param`. For instance, they could provide a query that retrieves sensitive data from the database or performs unauthorized actions. In the worst-case scenario, an attacker could use SSRF to make the server act as a proxy and access internal resources or perform other malicious activities.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to SSRF attacks, and it is essential to sanitize user input and validate the `sort_param` value to prevent such attacks.

65,CWE-863," The given Python code for the `send_transactions` function is not directly related to the `numOfBurgers` function, so I cannot evaluate its vulnerability based on the provided information. However, I will evaluate the `send_transactions` function based on the given code.

Yes, the `send_transactions` function is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input validation for the `nonce` parameter. The function assumes that if `nonce` is `None`, it will call the `get_nonce` method to retrieve the account nonce. However, an attacker could potentially pass a malicious nonce value, which could lead to unintended consequences, such as replay attacks or executing unintended transactions.

Therefore, the function should include proper input validation for the `nonce` parameter to ensure that it is either `None` or a valid nonce value. This can be achieved by adding a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that `nonce` is either `None` or a valid nonce value obtained from the account.

Here's an example of how to modify the function to include input validation for the `nonce` parameter:

```python
async def send_transactions(self, account, calls, nonce=None, max_fee=0):
    if nonce is None:

Yes, the `data_received` function is vulnerable. The reason is that the while loop at the beginning of the function does not have an exit condition that can be reached in all cases. If the incoming data is malformed or incomplete, the loop will continue indefinitely, consuming excessive resources. This behavior can be exploited by an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation and output encoding in the error message that is constructed using the `reason` parameter. This can lead to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

In the `_get_unauth_response` function, the error message is constructed using the `reason` parameter and then included in the response without proper encoding. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the error message, which will be executed in the victim's browser when they view the response.

Therefore, to mitigate this vulnerability, the `reason` parameter should be properly validated and encoded before it is included in the error message. This can be done using a library such as Django's `json.dumps()` function with the `ensure_ascii=True` argument or the `httpexceptions.HttpResponse` constructor with the `content_type='application/json'` argument and the `json.dumps()` function with the `ensure_ascii=True` argument.",2070,232,9.058376550674438

However, I will evaluate the `test_custom_field_table_render` function based on the context given in the CVE description and CWE description.

Based on the context provided, the `test_custom_field_table_render` function appears to be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, specifically Reflected XSS attacks. The vulnerability arises from the way the function handles user-controllable input (`col_expected_value`) when rendering the HTML output.

The function takes user-controllable input (`col_expected_value`) and uses it to generate HTML output without proper encoding or sanitization. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code into the output, which can then be executed in the context of the web application when the HTML is rendered in a user's web browser.

Therefore, the answer is 'YES' and the vulnerability is due to the lack of proper encoding or sanitization of user-controllable input when generating HTML output.",2449,271,10.791192770004272
