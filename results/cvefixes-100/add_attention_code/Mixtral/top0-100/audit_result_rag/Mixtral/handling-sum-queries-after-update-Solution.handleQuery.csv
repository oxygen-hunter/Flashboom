80,CWE-601," NO. The given code does not contain any redirect functionality, and therefore it is not vulnerable to CWE-601 Open Redirect attacks. The code is a Segment Tree implementation for handling queries related to a list of numbers.",2018,49,2.347949981689453
81,CWE-264," YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264 (Privilegees Escalation) due to the lack of proper access control checks when creating or using tokens. The code allows the creation of unscoped tokens without proper authorization checks and also allows the use of tokens for disabled users or tokens with changed passwords. This can lead to unintended authorization restrictions being bypassed.",4268,87,4.025513410568237
82,CWE-78," YES, the given code is vulnerable to OS command injection due to the use of the `exec()` function. The `exec()` function executes the given code string as if it were a part of the Python script, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if the code string comes from an untrusted source. In this case, the code string is retrieved from a file, which makes it susceptible to attacks.",2019,89,3.666119337081909
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths from external input. Instead, it defines a SegmentTree data structure and performs various operations on it using hard-coded indices and data.",1651,62,2.6156747341156006
84,CWE-352," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-352 as it is not handling user input without sufficient verification. Instead, it is using FastAPI, which is designed to handle HTTP requests and automatically checks the content-type header to ensure that the request body is JSON. If the content-type header is not application/json or another JSON compatible media type, the request will be rejected. Additionally, the code includes a patch to simulate an error in JSON parsing, which is not related to the vulnerability.",2324,112,4.598660945892334
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not directly handle user input or data from an untrusted source, and it does not appear to be related to the CWE-290 vulnerability described in the provided CVE. The code is for implementing a segment tree data structure and handling queries on it.",1684,62,2.5833799839019775
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code does not contain an infinite loop, and it is not vulnerable to CWE-835. The code is implementing a segment tree data structure, which is used to perform range queries and updates efficiently. The loop in the code is used to process each query in the given list, and it terminates after processing all the queries.",1895,73,3.09159779548645
87,CWE-444, NO. The given code does not appear to act as an intermediary HTTP agent and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that could allow for smuggling attacks as described in the CWE description. The code is simply parsing a dictionary-like object and constructing a new dictionary with some additional processing.,2679,69,3.042142868041992
88,CWE-79," The given code for the function `_get_unauth_response` is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the error message passed as the `reason` parameter is not properly escaped before being included in the URL query string. This can allow an attacker to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser.

Therefore, the answer is 'YES' and the reason is that the code does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input (the `reason` parameter) before it is placed in output that is used as a web page (the URL query string).",2949,137,5.64670729637146
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations and does not construct file paths based on user input, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or CVE-2023-50264.",1700,54,2.3024072647094727
90,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not construct a pathname using user-controlled input and does not appear to be vulnerable to path traversal attacks.,1693,31,1.5270352363586426
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input that could be used to construct URLs or similar requests. Instead, it defines a SegmentTree data structure and performs various operations on it using predefined inputs.",1694,63,2.646881341934204
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not construct a pathname using user-controlled input and does not use it in a file operation, so it is not vulnerable to path traversal attacks.",1746,39,1.7383599281311035
93,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not construct a pathname using user-controlled input and does not appear to be vulnerable to path traversal attacks.,1739,31,1.4398629665374756
94,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled URLs or similar requests. Instead, it defines a SegmentTree data structure and implements methods for updating and querying the tree.",1740,56,2.3729817867279053
95,CWE-79," NO.

The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is used as a web page served to other users. Instead, it is handling data internally and performing checks and transformations before rendering the output.",3328,72,3.238184690475464
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CWE-918 description provided.
