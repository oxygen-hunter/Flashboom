81,CWE-264," YES, the given Python code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token authentication and authorization, allowing unintended access to resources based on the provided token. The code does not check the validity or expiration of the token, and it does not enforce access control based on the token's tenant or user information. This can lead to unauthorized access to resources and bypassing intended authorization restrictions.",3352,94,4.069993257522583
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not involve constructing or executing OS commands using externally-influenced input.

85,CWE-290," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not related to authentication or authorization schemes. Instead, it is a function for validating an agent's data and checking the exclude list's regular expressions.",768,56,2.227534294128418
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for the function `data_received` does not contain an infinite loop as described in the CWE-835 vulnerability. The loop in the code exits when the condition `self._buffer` is false, which will eventually be the case once all data has been processed.",979,65,2.59793758392334
87,CWE-444," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in an inconsistent manner. Instead, it is a function that processes video data and returns a dictionary with video information.",1763,73,3.008185625076294
88,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the error message passed to the `urlencode()` function. The error message is coming from an untrusted source (user input), and it is being directly included in the URL without any encoding or validation. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code in the error message, which will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the URL.",2033,105,4.245835065841675
89,CWE-22, NO. The given Python code does not involve file operations and is not related to the described vulnerability (CWE-22). It is a function for calculating the number of unhappy friends in a social network based on given preferences and pairs.,784,51,2.0565831661224365
