76,CWE-284," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of access control checks when deleting a user. The code only checks if there is an admin user other than the one being deleted and if the user being deleted is not ""Guest"". However, it does not check if the user making the request has the necessary permissions to delete a user. This can allow unauthorized users to delete other users.",2178,87,3.5945968627929688
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server Side Request Forgery) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests using user-supplied data. Instead, it uses a hardcoded Dropbox URL and does not allow user input to be included in the request.",877,66,2.677293539047241
78,CWE-116," NO. The given code does not construct a command from user-supplied data without proper encoding or escaping. Instead, it constructs a list of command-line arguments and appends them to a pre-existing command (self.command). There is no evidence that the user-supplied data is ever directly used as part of the command string.",1596,73,2.989393949508667
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it is a function for finding prime pairs using the linear sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.",1110,58,2.3496100902557373
80,CWE-601, NO. The given code does not contain any functionality that would allow for an attacker to redirect the request to a malicious site. The code only performs some database updates and renders a template.,1169,41,1.7278149127960205
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration, allowing remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining. The code does not check the expiration of the provided token before creating a new one. This vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-2012-3426.",3419,90,3.9322867393493652
82,CWE-78," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the use of `exec()` function which executes the given code as a part of the current Python script. In this case, the code being executed is retrieved from an untrusted source (`config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`), making it susceptible to CWE-78 (OS Command Injection). An attacker could potentially inject and execute arbitrary OS commands.",1170,104,4.191133499145508
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve handling file paths or external input in a way that could allow an attacker to traverse outside of a restricted directory. Instead, it is a function for finding prime pairs using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.",802,75,2.9929919242858887
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE. It is a function for finding prime pairs using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.,1475,42,1.8168790340423584
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input or data from an untrusted source in an insecure manner. Instead, it is validating JSON data and calling a function `valid_exclude_list` to validate regular expressions, which does not seem to be related to the CVE described.",835,78,3.069010019302368
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for `data_received` function does not contain an infinite loop as described in the CWE-835 vulnerability. The loop in the code exits when `self._buffer` is empty, which is a reachable condition.",1046,56,2.296968698501587
87,CWE-444," The given code for `_parse_video` function does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities, and it does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that is inconsistent with how the messages will be processed by the ultimate destination. The function simply extracts information from a dictionary-like object `video` and returns a new dictionary. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",1830,104,4.226022005081177
88,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error URL. The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute malicious scripts in the context of the web application.",2100,67,2.892237424850464
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations and does not construct file paths using user-controlled input, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or any other file-related vulnerabilities.",851,50,2.0297889709472656
90,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not involve file operations and is not related to the described vulnerability (CWE-22). It is a function for finding prime pairs using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.,844,47,1.9116716384887695
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input that could be used to construct URLs or similar requests to unexpected destinations. Instead, it is a function for finding prime pairs using the linear sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.",845,69,2.79557728767395
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing a pathname from user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded path to the Flask-RESTX static files.",897,61,2.4365720748901367
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing a file path using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded file path to serve static files using Flask's send_file function.",890,65,2.6065077781677246
94,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in a way that could lead to SSRF attacks. Instead, it is a function for finding prime pairs using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.",891,64,2.618656635284424
95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users. Instead, it is a function for testing the rendering of custom fields in a table, and the input is hardcoded and not user-supplied.",2479,73,3.132028341293335
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions. The code only performs database queries and operations, and does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling URLs in a way that could be exploited for SSRF attacks.",1500,70,2.8795859813690186
97,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions.

98,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests using user-supplied data. Instead, it only processes form data internally and calls helper functions with predefined arguments.",1368,57,2.4203379154205322
99,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests using user-supplied data.

100,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it focuses on creating a book object and modifying its associated data within the local database.",1896,61,2.583312511444092
