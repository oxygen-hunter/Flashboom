1,CWE-918," Yes, the code is vulnerable. The issue is that the `url` parameter is not sufficiently validated or sanitized before being passed to the `requests_session.request()` function. An attacker could potentially provide a URL that points to an unexpected host or port, which could lead to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The `is_private_address()` check only applies to private addresses, but it does not prevent SSRF attacks to other hosts or ports.",1855,104,4.186550617218018
2,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve making external HTTP requests based on user input. Instead, it defines a function `is_private_address` that takes a URL as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the IP address associated with the URL is a private address or not. It does this by using the `urlparse` and `socket` modules to extract the hostname from the URL and then using the `ipaddress` module to determine if the resulting IP address is private. There is no user input involved in this process, so there is no risk of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.",1229,143,5.5407140254974365

5,CWE-918," Based on the provided code, the `add_security_headers` function does not appear to be directly vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks as defined by CWE-918. The function sets the Content-Security-Policy header based on a list of trusted hosts, but it does not make any external requests or allow user input that could be manipulated to make unintended requests.

However, it is important to note that the `isEscapePossible` function defined in the code snippet provided after the `add_security_headers` function could potentially be used in an SSRF attack if it is called with appropriate arguments. This function performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path between two points on a grid, and it does not check whether the points are within the grid boundaries or whether they are part of a list of blocked points. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `blocked` argument to include points outside the intended grid boundaries, allowing them to perform SSRF attacks on the server. Therefore, it is recommended to add appropriate checks to ensure that the `blocked` argument only contains points within the intended grid boundaries.

So, to answer the question, the `add_security_headers` function itself is not vulnerable to SSRF attacks, but other parts of the code could potentially be used in such attacks if not properly secured.",1323,296,11.365568161010742

The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-601 as it does not involve accepting a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site and using that link in a Redirect. Instead, it sets up a homeserver and performs some internal logic.",1062,64,2.6250569820404053
69,CWE-93," NO. The given code does not use CRLF sequences as special elements and does not handle user inputs directly. It only defines a helper function `isEscapePossible` for checking if there is a path between two points in a grid, given a list of blocked points.",790,59,2.3877224922180176
70,CWE-93, NO. The given code does not use CRLF sequences as special elements and does not process user input in a way that could lead to CRLF injection attacks.,748,35,1.4443559646606445
71,CWE-93," NO. The given code does not use CRLF sequences as special elements and does not handle user inputs. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-93.",794,36,1.5604500770568848
72,CWE-93," NO. The given code does not use CRLF sequences as special elements and does not process user inputs, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-93.",793,35,1.452235460281372
73,CWE-93, NO. The given code does not appear to handle CRLF sequences in a way that could lead to a CRLF attack as described in the CVE and CWE descriptions. The code only deals with integer coordinates and does not involve handling of strings or special characters like CRLF.,786,60,2.3866941928863525
74,CWE-79," YES, the code is vulnerable to CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting). The issue lies in the way the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` are constructed by interpolating the `bad_url` and `good_url` into the URL template string. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious URLs that bypass the intended security check. For example, an attacker could provide a `bad_url` of `javascript:alert('XSS')` or `http://attacker.com/malicious-script.js` to execute arbitrary code in the victim's browser. To mitigate this vulnerability, consider using a library or function that properly encodes or sanitizes the URL input before constructing the final URL.",2716,166,6.674211502075195
75,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it deletes data from the local database based on the user ID provided as an argument.",2141,61,2.8152871131896973
76,CWE-284," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper access control checks. The `_delete_user` function deletes a user and all associated data if the following conditions are met:

1. There exists an admin user in the system.
2. The user to be deleted is not the 'Guest' user.

However, there is no check to ensure that the user calling the `_delete_user` function is an admin user. This means that any user can call this function and delete other users, including admin users, if there is only one admin user left in the system. This is a clear violation of the principle of least privilege and can lead to unintended consequences.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to CWE-284: Improper Access Control. To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should be modified to ensure that only admin users can call the `_delete_user` function. This can be achieved by adding an access control check at the beginning of the function, for example, by checking the role of the user making the call.",2283,235,9.178165435791016
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve making HTTP requests to user-supplied URLs. Instead, it makes a request to a Dropbox share link, which is not user-supplied and is generated by the Dropbox library.",982,64,2.580734968185425
78,CWE-116," Based on the given code, the `prepare_plugin_docs_command` function does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-116 (Improper Escaping of Input). The function is constructing a command line argument list and appending it to a list, which is then used to construct the final command. There is no evidence that user-supplied data is being directly incorporated into shell commands without proper escaping.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",1701,101,4.078254699707031
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it checks for the presence of a session and adapts the label of a LoginButton based on the user's information. The isEscapePossible function is unrelated to this issue and is used for a different purpose.",1215,85,3.424689531326294
80,CWE-601," NO. The given code does not contain any open redirect vulnerability as it does not redirect to a user-controlled input. Instead, it redirects to the 'next' parameter or the topic's absolute URL, which are not user-controlled.",1274,54,2.2291040420532227
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration and allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining or leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account or for an account with a changed password.",3524,68,3.1166036128997803
82,CWE-78," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the use of the `exec()` function, which executes the given code as Python statements. In this case, the code being executed is retrieved from an untrusted source (`config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`), making it susceptible to CWE-78 (OS Command Injection).",1275,89,3.553210973739624
83,CWE-22," Based on the given code, the function `load` is vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it executes arbitrary code from a file retrieved from an untrusted source (`config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`). The `exec` statement executes the code directly in the global scope, allowing an attacker to potentially traverse outside of the restricted directory and access arbitrary files.",907,97,3.8530025482177734
84,CWE-352," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-352 as it is not handling user input without sufficient verification. Instead, it is testing the behavior of the FastAPI library when receiving a malformed request with an incorrect content type.",1580,54,2.277818202972412
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input in an unsanitized manner. Instead, it is validating JSON data and calling a function `valid_exclude_list` to validate regular expressions.",940,59,2.374131679534912
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code does not contain an infinite loop, as the while loop in the data\_received function has a clear exit condition (the buffer being empty). The isEscapePossible function is unrelated to the vulnerability discussed in the initial code snippet.",1151,58,2.5146265029907227
87,CWE-444," Based on the given code, the `_parse_video` function does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that is inconsistent with how the messages will be processed by the ultimate destination. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",1935,84,3.5392653942108154
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error_params string. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the URL, which will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the page.",2205,77,3.238534450531006
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to file path traversal attacks as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input.

95,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the use of `mark_safe()` or similar functions to render user-controllable input directly in HTML without proper escaping. The ` LocationTable.rows[0].get_cell(internal_col_name)` method call returns the cell value without any form of input validation or escaping, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the page. The `self.assertEqual(rendered_value, col_expected_value)` statement then compares the expected value with the attacker-supplied value, potentially leading to the execution of the attacker's script.",2584,144,5.876556873321533
96,CWE-918," Based on the given code, the function `add_objects` is not vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the CWE-918 description.
