1,CWE-918," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the fact that the `url` parameter is not sufficiently validated or sanitized before being passed to the `requests_session.request()` function. An attacker could potentially provide a URL that points to an unexpected host or port, which could lead to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The code does include some checks for private addresses, but these checks do not prevent SSRF attacks. To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the `url` parameter before passing it to `requests_session.request()`. This could be done by using a library or module specifically designed for URL validation and sanitization, or by implementing custom checks and sanitization logic in the code.",1897,165,6.491785049438477

The vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation and sanitization of the 'bad_url' and 'good_url' variables in the 'test_security_check' function. This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks as the code does not properly check the URL schemes and allows malicious scripts to be injected.",2758,83,3.571734666824341
75,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it deletes data from the local database based on the user ID provided as an argument.",2183,61,2.635899066925049
76,CWE-284," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of access control checks when deleting a user. The code only checks if there is an admin user present and if the user to be deleted is not ""Guest"". However, it does not check if the user making the request is an admin user or not. This means that any user can delete other users, including admin users, if they know their IDs. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege and can lead to unintended consequences.",2325,110,4.476970911026001
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve making an HTTP request to an untrusted source. Instead, it defines a recursive function for calculating the earliest and latest wins for a given number of players and their respective positions.",1024,62,2.5001978874206543
78,CWE-116," NO. The given code does not construct a command using user-supplied data without proper encoding or escaping. Instead, it constructs a command using predefined strings and a list, which is not vulnerable to command injection attacks.",1743,48,2.0778419971466064
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it is implementing a memoized recursive function to find the earliest and latest wins for a given number of players and their respective positions.",1257,64,2.744471311569214
80,CWE-601," NO. The given code does not contain any functionality that would allow for an open redirect vulnerability as described in the CWE-601 description. The code only deals with updating a Topic object and rendering a template, and does not involve any redirection to user-controlled input.",1316,61,2.5003573894500732
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration, allowing remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining. The code does not check the validity or expiration of the provided tokens before creating new ones.",3566,68,3.1082839965820312
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not involve constructing or executing OS commands using externally-influenced input. Instead, it defines a function `memoization` and calls it with fixed arguments.",1317,55,2.264490842819214
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not use user-supplied input to construct file paths, and therefore it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) attacks.",949,39,1.6133246421813965
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE. It is a separate function for calculating the earliest and latest wins for a given number of players and their scores.,1622,45,1.9488165378570557
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input or data from an untrusted source in an insecure manner. Instead, it is validating JSON data and calling a function `valid_exclude_list` to validate regular expressions, which does not involve any authentication or spoofing risks.",982,77,3.1148970127105713
86,CWE-835, NO. The given code for the function `earliestAndLatest` does not contain an infinite loop or a loop with an exit condition that cannot be reached. It is a separate function that does not interact with the `data_received` function or the buffer handling in any way.,1193,60,2.4709439277648926
87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that is inconsistent with how the messages will be processed by the ultimate destination. Instead, it simply constructs and returns a dictionary with video information.",1977,81,3.3405697345733643
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the URL with urlencode(). An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the error message, which will be reflected back to the user's browser and executed.",2247,73,3.0989294052124023

91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input that could be used to construct URLs or similar requests to unexpected destinations.

95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users. Instead, it is performing a calculation and comparing expected and actual values.",2626,56,2.5064425468444824
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions.
