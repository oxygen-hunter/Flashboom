25,CWE-918," The given Python code for the `list_books()` function does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks as described in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions. The reason is that the code does not directly construct or manipulate URLs or other external requests based on user input. Instead, it uses the input to determine how to query the local database, and all database queries are performed using the `calibre_db` object, which is presumably a local database connection or session. Therefore, there is no way for an attacker to use this function to make requests to arbitrary external URLs or perform SSRF attacks.

However, it's important to note that other parts of the codebase or other functions in the application may still be vulnerable to SSRF attacks or other types of vulnerabilities. The given code snippet alone does not represent the entire application or its security context. Therefore, it's always a good practice to thoroughly review the entire application and its security design to ensure that all components are secure.

The vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation and sanitization of the 'bad_url' and 'good_url' variables in the 'test_security_check' function. The code constructs URLs by interpolating these variables into a template string, which can result in the execution of malicious scripts if the variables contain malicious input. This is an example of a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",2607,103,4.358259677886963
75,CWE-918," The given code for `_delete_user` function is not directly related to the provided CVE-2022-0339 and CWE-918 description. The `_delete_user` function is checking for admin privileges before deleting a user, and it does not involve any URL or similar request that could be manipulated for SSRF attacks. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",2032,89,3.7289679050445557
76,CWE-284," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper access control checks. The code deletes a user and all associated data if the following condition is met:

1. The query returns at least one user with the role of 'admin'.
2. The user to be deleted is not 'Guest'.

However, there is no check to ensure that the user making the call to this function has the 'admin' role. This means that any user can call this function and delete any other user, including admin users. This is a clear violation of the principle of least privilege and can lead to unintended consequences.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to CWE-284: Improper Access Control. To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should ensure that only users with the 'admin' role can call this function. This can be achieved by adding an access control check at the beginning of the function, for example, by checking the role of the user making the call.",2174,216,8.486387968063354
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve making a request to an untrusted source based on user input. Instead, it makes a request to a Dropbox link obtained from the recipe object, which is not user-supplied data.",873,64,2.6419968605041504
78,CWE-116," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-116 as it does not involve constructing a command from user-supplied data without proper encoding or escaping. Instead, it constructs a list of command-line arguments and appends them to a pre-existing list, which is then joined into a single command string using the `join()` method. This does not involve interpreting user-supplied data as part of the command itself.",1592,100,4.075596332550049

82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not involve constructing or executing OS commands using externally-influenced input.

85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input or data from an untrusted source in an insecure manner.

87,CWE-444," The given code for `_parse_video` function does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities, and it does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that is inconsistent with how the ultimate destination entities will process them. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",1826,81,3.331800699234009
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error URL.
