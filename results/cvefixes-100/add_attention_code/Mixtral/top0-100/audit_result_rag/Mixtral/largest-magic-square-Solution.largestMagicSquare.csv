1,CWE-918," The given code for the function `get_response` is not directly related to the function `largestMagicSquare`. Therefore, I cannot determine if the `get_response` function is vulnerable based on the provided code alone.

However, I can tell you that the `get_response` function appears to be making HTTP requests using the `requests` library, and it does not seem to be validating the URL before making the request. This could potentially make it vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, as described in the CWE-918 description.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate the URL before making the request, ensuring that it is only making requests to trusted endpoints. This can be done by checking that the URL is within a known list of allowed URLs, or by using a whitelist of allowed schemes and domains.

Therefore, my answer would be 'YES', and the reason for vulnerability is that the code does not sufficiently validate the URL before making the request, potentially allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary URL, which could lead to SSRF attacks.",1939,242,9.379385948181152

79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it is a function for finding the largest magic square in a given grid.",1299,52,2.166167736053467
80,CWE-601," NO. The given code does not contain any functionality that would allow for an open redirect vulnerability as described in the CWE-601 description. The code is for a function that finds the largest magic square in a given grid, and does not involve any user-controlled input or redirection functionality.",1358,64,2.6246862411499023
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration and allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens or leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account or an account with a changed password.",3608,63,2.944243907928467
82,CWE-78," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the use of `exec()` function which executes the given code as a part of the current Python script. Since the code being executed is retrieved from an untrusted source (config.retrieveBoilerplateFile()), an attacker could potentially inject arbitrary OS commands, leading to a CWE-78 (OS Command Injection) vulnerability.",1359,90,3.5836679935455322
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 as it does not involve constructing file paths from external input. Instead, it is a function for finding the largest magic square in a given grid.",991,48,2.080280065536499
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE. It is a function for finding the largest magic square in a given grid.,1664,37,1.6633496284484863
85,CWE-290, NO. The given code does not appear to be related to the validation of agent data or any authentication scheme. It is a separate function for finding the largest magic square in a given grid.,1024,39,1.6955986022949219
86,CWE-835, NO. The given code for the function `largestMagicSquare` does not contain an infinite loop or a loop with an unreachable exit condition. It is a separate function that calculates the largest magic square in a given grid. The `data_received` function provided earlier is vulnerable due to an infinite loop in its implementation.,1235,72,2.887563467025757
87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to act as an intermediary HTTP agent and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that could allow for smuggling attacks as described in the CWE-444 description. Instead, it is a Python function that processes video data and returns a dictionary with video information.",2019,70,2.9375994205474854
88,CWE-79," The given code for the function `_get_unauth_response` is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability exists due to the error message being constructed from user-controllable input (reason) and being returned to the user without proper escaping.

An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code in the reason parameter, which will be reflected back in the error message and executed in the user's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as stealing sensitive information, performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user, or even taking control of the user's machine.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to CWE-79 (Cross-Site Scripting) and the described vulnerability is similar to CVE-2021-25963. To mitigate this vulnerability, the error message should be properly escaped before being returned to the user. This can be done using a library like Django's `json.dumps()` with the `ensure_ascii=True` option or by using a library specifically designed for HTML or JavaScript escaping, such as `httplib2.HTMLParser()` or `jsesc`.",2289,260,10.164856433868408
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations using user-controlled input, and hence it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) attacks.",1040,38,1.609243631362915
90,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not involve file operations and is not related to the described vulnerability (CWE-22). It is a function to find the largest magic square in a given grid.,1033,42,1.7552554607391357
91,CWE-918, NO. The given code does not appear to receive or process user-controlled input in a way that could lead to SSRF vulnerabilities. It is instead focused on generating magic squares from a given grid.,1034,45,1.863499641418457
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing a pathname using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a fixed path to the'static' directory within the application's file system.",1086,62,2.5046942234039307
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input.

95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users.
