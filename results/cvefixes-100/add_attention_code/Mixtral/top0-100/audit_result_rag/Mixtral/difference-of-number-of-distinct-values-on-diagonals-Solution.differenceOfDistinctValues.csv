78,CWE-116," Yes, it is vulnerable. The issue is that the `plugin_names` argument is not being properly escaped before being included in the command string. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by providing specially crafted input for `plugin_names`. This could lead to the execution of arbitrary commands on the host machine instead of the intended virtual environment.",1566,73,3.047609806060791
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it checks for the presence of a session variable and returns a LoginButton based on that information.",1080,56,2.281639814376831
80,CWE-601, NO. The given code does not contain any functionality that would allow for an attacker to redirect the request to a malicious site. The code only performs database updates and renders a template.,1139,40,1.685591697692871
81,CWE-264," Yes, it is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly validate or check the tenant or user credentials before creating a new token. This can allow an attacker to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens with different tenants or users.",3389,57,2.6807730197906494
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not construct or modify OS commands using externally-influenced input. Instead, it executes a local Python script retrieved from a configuration file using the `exec()` function, which does not involve OS command execution.",1140,65,2.614666223526001
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to involve file operations or the construction of file paths, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 or path traversal attacks.",772,37,1.5353844165802002
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the CWE-352 vulnerability described in the CVE. The code is for testing a FastAPI application and does not involve handling user requests or input in a way that could lead to CSRF or other types of attacks.,1445,59,2.5564732551574707
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input or data from an untrusted source in an insecure manner. Instead, it is validating JSON data and checking the validity of regular expressions, which are not susceptible to spoofing attacks.",805,68,2.6957247257232666
86,CWE-835, NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-835 as it does not contain an infinite loop. The loop in the code exits when the buffer is empty or an exception is raised.,1016,43,1.7864129543304443
87,CWE-444, NO. The given code does not appear to act as an intermediary HTTP agent and does not parse or interpret HTTP messages in a way that could allow for smuggling attacks as described in the CWE-444 description. The code is simply extracting information from a dictionary-like object and returning a new dictionary.,1800,68,2.832218647003174
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error URL. The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute malicious scripts in the context of the web application.",2070,66,2.8140182495117188
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations using user-controlled input, and hence it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) attacks.",821,38,1.5721073150634766
90,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations and does not construct file paths using user-controlled input. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or any other file-related vulnerabilities.",814,51,2.045916795730591
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to receive a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieve the contents of this URL without sufficient validation. Instead, it defines a local function `update` that operates on a local `grid` argument and calculates differences between distinct values in the grid. The `send_file` function called in the `backup_download` function is not related to receiving or validating URLs.",815,89,3.474891185760498
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded path to the Flask-RESTX static directory.",867,60,2.3976919651031494
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded directory structure.",860,51,2.040116786956787
94,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled URLs or similar requests. Instead, it defines a function `swaggerui_static` for serving static files and another function `differenceOfDistinctValues` for calculating the difference between distinct values in a grid.",861,76,3.071556329727173
95,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the use of `mark_safe()` or similar functions to render user-controllable input directly in HTML without proper escaping. In the given code, the `rendered_value` from the `get_cell()` method is directly compared to `col_expected_value` without any validation or escaping, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts if the input contains HTML or JavaScript code.",2449,106,4.455630779266357
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the CWE-918 description provided. The code does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied data in a way that could lead to SSRF vulnerabilities. Instead, it only deals with querying and manipulating data within the local database.",1470,82,3.3044748306274414
