Therefore, there is no risk of path traversal attacks.",752,77,3.062110662460327
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE. It is a function for selecting the font with the given width and height based on the text and available fonts.,1425,45,1.9182288646697998
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it does not involve any authentication or authorization checks, and it does not handle user input in a way that could lead to spoofing attacks. Instead, it is a function for selecting the font with the given width and height constraints from a list of available fonts.",785,75,2.929116725921631
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for the function `data_received` does not contain an infinite loop as described in the CWE-835 vulnerability. The loop in the code exits when the buffer does not contain enough data to form a complete message, or when an exception is raised during message parsing. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the described Denial of Service attack.

The `maxFont` function, on the other hand, is not related to the given vulnerability and does not contain an infinite loop. It is a separate function that returns the font index for the given text, width, and height based on the available fonts and their corresponding widths and heights.",996,145,5.590601921081543
87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to act as an intermediary HTTP agent and does not parse or interpret HTTP messages in a way that could allow for smuggling attacks as described in the CWE-444 description. Instead, it is a Python function that processes video data and returns a dictionary with video information.",1780,68,2.8287651538848877
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error URL. This can allow an attacker to inject and execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser.",2050,64,2.723435878753662
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it is a function for selecting the best font based on given text and font options.",801,59,2.3607468605041504
90,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it is a function for selecting the best font based on given text, width, height, and available fonts.",794,65,2.5776453018188477
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to receive a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieve the contents of this URL without sufficient validation. Instead, it defines a local function and uses it to determine the font for given text based on width and height constraints.",795,56,2.231412649154663
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing a file path using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded file path to serve static files using Flask's send_file function.",847,65,2.7264411449432373
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing a file path using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded path to the'static' directory within the 'flask_restx' library.",840,67,2.7139861583709717
94,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in a way that could lead to SSRF attacks. Instead, it is a function for determining the best font to use based on given text, width, height, and available fonts.",841,70,2.773564100265503
95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users. Instead, it is a function for calculating the font size based on a given text and font list.",2429,63,2.749549627304077
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions. The code does not involve handling or constructing URLs or similar requests to external sources, and instead focuses on querying and manipulating local database objects.",1450,66,2.711599349975586
97,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions. The code does not involve handling or constructing URLs or similar requests to external sources, and instead only deals with querying and manipulating local database objects.",1450,67,2.8118863105773926
98,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests using user-supplied data. Instead, it only processes form data internally and calls helper functions with predefined arguments.",1318,57,2.385535955429077
99,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests using user-supplied data. Instead, it only processes form data internally and calls helper functions with predefined arguments.",1318,57,2.349740505218506
100,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it focuses on creating a book object and handling various metadata associated with it.",1846,58,2.5128300189971924
