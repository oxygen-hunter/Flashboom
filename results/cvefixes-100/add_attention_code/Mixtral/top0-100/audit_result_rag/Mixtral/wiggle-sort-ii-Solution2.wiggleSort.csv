The vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation and sanitization of the 'bad_url' and 'good_url' variables in the 'test_security_check' function. The code constructs URLs using these variables without checking if they are safe or not. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing malicious URLs that contain scripts or other malicious content, which can be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the generated URLs. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and other security vulnerabilities.",2936,129,5.305965185165405

78,CWE-116," The given code for `prepare_plugin_docs_command` function does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-116 (Improper Escaping of Input). The function is only checking and raising errors based on the input types and valid values, it does not construct or pass any user-supplied input to a shell command without proper escaping.

However, the `wiggleSort` function is a separate function and is not related to the initial question. It is a custom sorting algorithm and does not involve any command line arguments or shell commands. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-116.

95,CWE-79," The given code for `test_custom_field_table_render` function is not directly related to the `wiggleSort` function provided, so I cannot evaluate its vulnerability based on the provided code alone. However, I will evaluate the `test_custom_field_table_render` function based on the context and information provided in the initial code snippet.

Based on the provided context, the `test_custom_field_table_render` function appears to be a unit test for rendering custom columns in a table. The function generates expected values for various column types and then checks that the actual rendered values match the expected values.

The vulnerability described in the context is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, specifically a Reflected XSS vulnerability. The vulnerability occurs due to incorrect usage of Django's `mark_safe()` API when rendering certain types of user-authored content.

In the given code, there is no evidence of user-authored content being rendered using `mark_safe()` or any other method that could potentially introduce XSS vulnerabilities. The code only generates expected values and checks the actual rendered values against those expected values.

Therefore, based on the provided code, the answer is 'NO'. The code is not vulnerable to XSS attacks as described in the context.",2804,285,11.24935245513916
