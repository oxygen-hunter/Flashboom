1,CWE-918," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation and sanitization on the 'url' parameter in the 'get_response' function. This can potentially allow an attacker to provide a malicious URL that could lead to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The 'is_private_address' check and'settings.ENFORCE_PRIVATE_ADDRESS_BLOCK' are not sufficient to prevent SSRF attacks as they only check for private addresses and do not validate the URL scheme or other parameters.",1707,118,4.763740301132202

79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it is focused on handling session data and generating a login button based on that data.",1067,54,2.2019360065460205
80,CWE-601, NO. The given code does not contain any functionality that would allow for an external URL to be specified and used in a redirect. The code only performs database updates and renders a template.,1126,39,1.6438236236572266
81,CWE-264," The given code is not directly related to the initial code snippet provided, which was about authentication and token management in OpenStack. The second code snippet is about a `cleanRoom` method for a robot. Therefore, I cannot determine if it is vulnerable to CWE-264 based on the provided information.

Answer: NO.",3376,73,3.26891827583313
82,CWE-78, NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not construct or modify OS commands using externally-influenced input. The `load` function is not directly related to the `cleanRoom` function and does not involve any OS command execution.,1127,59,2.400146484375
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 as it does not involve constructing file paths from external input. Instead, it defines local functions and performs a depth-first search within a grid using a robot object.",759,52,2.086683988571167
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to handling HTTP requests and does not involve parsing JSON data from the request body. It is a separate function for cleaning a room using a robot.,1432,39,1.6913938522338867
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it does not involve any unsanitized user input or authentication schemes. Instead, it is a function for cleaning a room using a robot and performing a depth-first search.",792,56,2.236210823059082
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for the `data_received` function does not contain an infinite loop. The loop condition `while self._buffer:` ensures that the loop will terminate once the buffer is empty. Additionally, the code inside the loop is designed to parse incoming data and process it, which does not create an infinite loop. The `dfs` function in the `cleanRoom` method is unrelated to the `data_received` function and does not contain an infinite loop either.",1003,103,4.0536789894104
87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to act as an intermediary HTTP agent and does not parse or interpret HTTP messages in a way that could allow for smuggling attacks as described in the CWE-444 description. Instead, it is a Python function that processes a video dictionary and returns a dictionary with various video metadata.",1787,70,2.9338886737823486
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the error message passed to the `urlencode()` function. The attacker can inject malicious scripts in the `reason` parameter, which will be reflected back in the URL and executed by the victim's browser when they visit the login page.",2057,82,3.480721950531006
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations using user-controlled input, and it does not construct file paths. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or any other file-related vulnerabilities.",808,53,2.1933305263519287
90,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations using user-controlled input, and hence it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) attacks.",801,38,1.5652186870574951
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to receive or process user-controlled input that could be used to construct a URL or similar request to an unexpected destination. Instead, it defines local functions and performs a depth-first search within the context of a robot's movement.",802,57,2.2891383171081543
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded path to the Flask-RESTX static files.",854,60,2.4264976978302
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded path to the Flask-RESTX static directory.",847,60,2.468165159225464
94,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to receive or process user-controlled URLs or similar requests, and therefore is not vulnerable to CWE-918 or SSRF attacks.",848,41,1.7389426231384277
95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users. Instead, it is a function for testing the rendering of custom fields in a table, and the input is hardcoded and not user-supplied.",2436,73,3.1169991493225098
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions. The code does not involve handling or constructing URLs or similar requests to external sources, and instead focuses on adding new objects to a local database.",1457,65,2.7223377227783203
97,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions.

98,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests using user-supplied data.
