78,CWE-116," NO. The given code does not construct a command from user-supplied input without proper encoding or escaping, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-116. Instead, it constructs a list of command-line arguments and appends them to a pre-existing command string using the 'join' method, which does not involve any shell command execution.",1741,76,3.1287319660186768
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it is a function for checking the login status of a user and generating a login button based on that status.",1255,59,2.415700674057007
80,CWE-601, NO. The given code does not contain any functionality that would allow for an attacker to redirect the user to a malicious site. The code only deals with updating a topic object and rendering a template.,1314,42,1.7892324924468994
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration, allowing remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining. The code does not check the validity or expiration of the provided tokens before creating new ones.",3564,68,3.1107099056243896
82,CWE-78," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the use of the `exec()` function, which executes the given code string as Python code. Since the code string is retrieved from an untrusted source (`config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`), an attacker could potentially inject arbitrary OS commands or malicious Python code, leading to a CWE-78 (OS Command Injection) vulnerability.",1315,102,4.063032865524292
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve handling file paths or external input in a way that could allow an attacker to traverse outside of a restricted directory. Instead, it defines a function `maxProduct` that calculates the maximum product of two palindromic subsequences in a given string using dynamic programming.",947,85,3.370043992996216
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE. It is a separate function for finding the maximum product of a palindromic subsequence in a given string.,1620,45,1.9415009021759033
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not related to authentication schemes or spoofing attacks. Instead, it is a function for validating JSON data and checking the validity of regular expressions in an exclude list.",980,57,2.2929437160491943
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for the function `data_received` does not contain an infinite loop, and it is not vulnerable to CWE-835. The `maxProduct` function, on the other hand, is not related to the given vulnerability and does not contain any issues related to infinite loops.",1191,66,2.6765828132629395
87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that is inconsistent with how the messages will be processed by the ultimate destination. Instead, it simply constructs and returns a dictionary with video information.",1975,81,3.3628416061401367
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the URL with urlencode(). An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the error message, which will be reflected back to the user's browser and executed.",2245,73,3.089378833770752
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations using user-controlled input, and hence it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Arbitrary File Deletion or Writing) attacks. The code is focused on calculating the maximum product of a palindromic subsequence of a given string using dynamic programming.",996,69,2.841099500656128
90,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not involve file operations and is not related to the described vulnerability (CWE-22). It is a separate function for calculating the maximum product of a palindromic subsequence of a given string.,989,51,2.1262781620025635
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in the way that could lead to server-side request forgery. Instead, it is a function for calculating the maximum product of a palindromic subsequence of a given string.",990,69,2.7432405948638916
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded path to the'static' directory within the application's file structure.",1042,63,2.522385358810425
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded path to the'static' directory within the application's 'libs' directory.",1035,66,2.6483829021453857
94,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in a way that could lead to server-side request forgery (SSRF).

95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users.
