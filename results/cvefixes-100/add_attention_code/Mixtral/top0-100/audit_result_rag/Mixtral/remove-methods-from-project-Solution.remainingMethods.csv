Instead, it constructs command-line arguments using only predefined options and a list of plugin names.",1543,62,2.594327211380005
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it checks for the presence of a session and adapts the label of a LoginButton based on the user's information.",1057,63,2.538875102996826
80,CWE-601, NO. The given code does not contain any functionality that would allow for an attacker to redirect the request to a malicious site. The code only performs database updates and renders a template.,1116,40,1.7128517627716064
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token authentication and authorization, allowing unintended access to resources based on the provided token. The code does not check the validity or expiration of the token, and it allows the creation of new tokens with unscoped or scoped access based on the provided credentials or an existing token. This can lead to unauthorized access to resources and bypassing intended authorization restrictions.",3366,100,4.305045127868652
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not involve constructing or executing OS commands using externally-influenced input. Instead, it defines a helper function `bfs()` and uses it to perform a breadth-first search algorithm on a graph represented by the `adj` list. The `load()` function retrieves and executes a boilerplate file, but it does not involve constructing or executing OS commands.",1117,103,4.036300182342529
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to involve file operations or the construction of file paths, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 or path traversal attacks.",749,37,1.5243196487426758
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE-2021-32677 and CWE-352. It is a completely different function that deals with graph traversal using Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm.,1422,61,2.5560708045959473
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input or data from an untrusted source in a way that could lead to spoofing attacks. Instead, it is validating JSON data and checking the validity of regular expressions, which are not susceptible to this type of vulnerability.",782,75,3.010312080383301
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for `data_received` function does not contain an infinite loop as described in the CWE-835 vulnerability. The loop in the code exits when `self._buffer` is empty or an exception is raised. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the described Denial of Service attack.

The `remainingMethods` function is not related to the given vulnerability and does not contain any infinite loops either.",993,95,3.7696430683135986
87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to act as an intermediary HTTP agent and does not parse or interpret HTTP messages in a way that could allow for smuggling attacks as described in the CWE-444 description. Instead, it is parsing a Vimeo video URL to extract the vimeo id and creating a dictionary with various video metadata.",1777,77,3.2012033462524414
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error URL. The attacker can inject malicious scripts in the ""reason"" parameter, which will be reflected back in the URL and executed by the victim's browser when they visit the page.",2047,81,3.3761398792266846
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations using user-controlled input, and hence it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) attacks.",798,38,1.6316430568695068
90,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations and does not construct file paths, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or any other file-related vulnerabilities.",791,44,1.7919871807098389
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to receive or process user-controlled input that could be used to construct a URL or similar request to an unexpected destination. Instead, it defines a helper function `bfs()` for performing a breadth-first search on a graph represented by an adjacency list, and the `backup_download()` function simply returns a file using the `send_file()` function with a locally-determined file path.",792,97,3.8113186359405518
92,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not involve file operations and is not related to the described vulnerability (CWE-22).,844,27,1.165374755859375

94,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled URLs or similar requests. Instead, it defines a helper function for a graph traversal problem and does not involve any network requests or file handling.",838,60,2.4597604274749756
95,CWE-79," NO.

The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users. Instead, it is validating expected values against the output of a database query.",2426,60,2.684096097946167
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions. The code does not involve handling or constructing URLs or similar requests to external sources, and instead only deals with querying and manipulating local database objects.",1447,67,2.833040714263916
97,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions.

98,CWE-918," The given code is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE. The code is a Python definition for a method named `convert_bookformat` and an additional method named `remainingMethods`. This code does not involve handling user input or URL construction, which are the key factors in the described vulnerability. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",1315,78,3.1416516304016113
