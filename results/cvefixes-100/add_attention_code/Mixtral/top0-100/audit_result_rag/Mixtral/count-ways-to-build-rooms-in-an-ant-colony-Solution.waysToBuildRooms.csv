88,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter passed to the _get\_unauth\_response function. The vulnerable lines are:

error_params = urlencode({""error"": force_text(reason)})
login_url = force_str(reverse(""shuup_admin:login"") + ""?"" + error_params)

These lines construct a URL with the user-supplied ""reason"" parameter without proper validation or encoding, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that can be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the URL.",2170,148,6.1106858253479
