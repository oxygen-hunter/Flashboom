The vulnerability is due to the fact that the `recipe.link` is being constructed by concatenating a hardcoded string with the `Dropbox.get_share_link(recipe)` response, which can potentially contain malicious URLs. An attacker can manipulate the `Dropbox.get_share_link(recipe)` response to include a malicious URL, which will then be fetched and executed by the `requests.get()` function. This can lead to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, as described in the CVE and CWE descriptions provided.",673,138,5.3774025440216064
78,CWE-116," Based on the given code, the `prepare_plugin_docs_command` function does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-116 (Improper Escaping of Input). The function is constructing a command line argument list and appending it to a list, which is then appended to the command list. There is no evidence that the user-supplied input is being directly passed to a shell command without proper escaping.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",1392,103,4.087108850479126
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it checks for the presence of a session variable and returns a LoginButton based on the session information.",906,57,2.2887635231018066
80,CWE-601, NO. The given code does not contain any functionality that would allow for an attacker to redirect the user to a malicious site. The code only performs database updates and renders a template.,965,40,1.672163724899292
81,CWE-264," Yes, it is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it allows the creation of unscoped tokens without a tenant ID, which can be used to bypass intended authorization restrictions.",3215,41,2.0558924674987793
82,CWE-78," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the execution of arbitrary code using the `exec()` function with the untrusted `code` variable. This allows an attacker to inject and execute malicious Python code, leading to potential OS command injection and other attacks. The `minTimeToVisitAllPoints` function is not related to the vulnerability and can be ignored.",966,84,3.440016984939575
83,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not appear to involve file operations or path construction that could be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) attacks. It only defines a function `load` and another function `minTimeToVisitAllPoints` which does not involve any file I/O operations.,598,65,2.529914617538452
84,CWE-352," NO. The given code is not related to the CWE-352 vulnerability described in the CVE. The code is a unit test for a FastAPI application, and it is testing that the application correctly handles an invalid JSON payload in a POST request. The code does not process user input or handle requests from a client, so it is not vulnerable to CSRF attacks or other types of request forgery.",1271,88,3.5082595348358154
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input or data from an untrusted source in an insecure manner. Instead, it is validating JSON data and checking the validity of regular expressions, which are not susceptible to spoofing attacks.",631,68,2.7356131076812744
86,CWE-835," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to an infinite loop in the `data_received` function. If an attacker can provide malformed data that causes an exception in the inner try block, the outer while loop will continue indefinitely, consuming excessive resources.",842,62,2.5625433921813965
87,CWE-444," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The issue is that the code makes an HTTP request to Vimeo using the `smuggle_url` function, which allows passing custom HTTP headers. An attacker could potentially manipulate these headers to perform HTTP smuggling attacks, such as injecting malicious cookies or modifying the response content. This could lead to unintended data leakage or other security vulnerabilities. The use of the `smuggle_url` function with custom headers in this context is inconsistent with how the ultimate destination (Vimeo) will interpret these headers, making it susceptible to HTTP smuggling attacks.",1626,135,5.384796142578125
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter passed to the _get\_unauth\_response function. The vulnerable line is: error\_params = urlencode({""error"": force\_text(reason)})

This line constructs an error\_params query string with the user-supplied reason parameter without proper validation or encoding, making it susceptible to XSS attacks if an attacker injects malicious scripts into the reason parameter. The vulnerable code snippet is responsible for the CVE-2021-25963 vulnerability.",1896,143,5.685555696487427
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve constructing a pathname from user-controlled input, and therefore does not have the potential to be vulnerable to path traversal attacks. The code only uses a predefined setting (settings.backup.folder) to construct the file path.",647,58,2.331198215484619
90,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve constructing a file path from user-controlled input, and therefore is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) attacks. The code only performs a simple file download operation using a predefined folder location.",640,56,2.288973093032837
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not receive a URL or similar request from an upstream component and does not retrieve the contents of such a URL without sufficient validation. Instead, it constructs a local file path using a given filename and sends a file from that local path.",641,55,2.176734685897827
92,CWE-22," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing a file path using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded file path to serve static files using the Flask `send_file` function.",693,67,2.689603328704834
93,CWE-22," YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal). The issue is that the filename is constructed using user-controlled input, and it is not properly neutralized, allowing an attacker to potentially traverse outside of the intended directory and read arbitrary files. In this specific code, the parent directories are being traversed using the os.path.dirname() function, which can lead to a directory traversal attack.",686,95,3.6759133338928223
94,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled URLs or similar requests. Instead, it is a function for serving static files using Flask.",687,50,2.00007963180542
95,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, specifically Reflected XSS. The vulnerability arises from the use of `mark_safe()` or its equivalent `format_html()` in an inappropriate way. The `rendered_value` variable obtained from `bound_row.get_cell(internal_col_name)` is assumed to be safe, but it may contain user-controllable input that is not properly sanitized. This user-controllable input can be used to inject malicious scripts, which will be executed in the context of the web application when the page is rendered.

The `custom_column_expected` dictionary contains user-controllable input in the form of HTML and URLs. When the test case compares the expected value with the actual value, it does not properly sanitize the user-controllable input. This can lead to the execution of malicious scripts when the rendered HTML is displayed to the user.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the user-controllable input should be properly sanitized before being used in the test case. This can be achieved by using Django's built-in functions like `escapejs()` or `format_html()` to ensure that any user-controllable input is properly escaped and safe for use in HTML contexts.

Here's an example",2275,301,11.635567426681519
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CWE-918 description provided.
