25,CWE-918," The given Python code for the `list_books()` function is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks due to the way it constructs and executes SQL queries based on user input. The `sort_param` variable is used to determine which SQL join and order to apply, and this value can be manipulated by an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries.

The `sort_param` value is taken directly from the user input without any validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious value that includes SQL injection payloads. For example, an attacker could set `sort_param` to a value like `""authors; DROP TABLE Books;--""` to execute a SQL command that drops the `Books` table.

The `sort_param` value is then used to construct the SQL query with the `join` and `order` variables, which are also constructed based on user input. This creates a complex SQL query that is vulnerable to SSRF attacks, as the query can be manipulated to include external URLs or other malicious payloads.

Therefore, the `list_books()` function is vulnerable to SSRF attacks due to the lack of input validation and sanitization for the `sort_param` value, and the way it constructs and executes SQL queries based on this user input.

To mitigate this vulnerability",4081,301,12.047320127487183
26,CWE-918," The given Python code for the `list_books()` function is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The vulnerability arises from the way the code constructs SQL queries based on user input, specifically the `sort_param` argument.

The code performs different actions based on the value of `sort_param`, and in some cases, it constructs SQL queries that join multiple tables. If an attacker can manipulate the `sort_param` value, they can potentially inject malicious SQL queries that could lead to unintended database queries or even data leaks.

For example, an attacker could set `sort_param` to a value that triggers a join with an unexpected table, or they could inject malicious SQL code in the `order` parameter. This could potentially allow the attacker to access sensitive data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary code on the server.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to SSRF attacks, and it is recommended to sanitize user input and use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection and SSRF vulnerabilities.",4081,234,9.531198978424072

68,CWE-601," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-601 as it does not involve accepting a user-controlled input and redirecting to an external site. Instead, it sets up a local homeserver and does not involve any network redirection.",1126,58,2.362752914428711
69,CWE-93," NO. The given code does not use CRLF sequences as special elements and does not handle user inputs, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-93.",854,35,1.4632062911987305
70,CWE-93," NO. The given Python code does not use CRLF sequences as special elements and does not process user input, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-93.",812,36,1.4861791133880615

74,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting). The vulnerability arises from the lack of input validation and sanitization of user-controllable data (bad_url and good_url) in the construction of the URLs. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application, which can then be executed in the context of the web server's domain, leading to potential security risks such as data theft, unauthorized access, and privilege escalation.",2780,110,4.607058048248291
75,CWE-918," NO. The given code is not vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it deletes data from the local database based on the user ID provided as an argument.",2205,58,2.7461369037628174
76,CWE-284," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper access control checks. The code deletes a user and all associated data without checking if the caller has the necessary privileges to perform such an action. This can lead to unauthorized deletion of user data. In this case, the deletion is only restricted to admin users, but the check for admin privileges is not properly implemented. The code only checks if there is an admin user other than the one being deleted, but it does not check if the caller is an admin user. Therefore, an attacker could potentially delete an admin user if they manage to gain access to the system with sufficient privileges. This vulnerability falls under the CWE-284 category, as described in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions.",2347,169,6.792560577392578
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests based on user input.

79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it is a function for checking the login status of a user and adapting the label of a LoginButton based on the user's session information.",1279,68,2.909559726715088
80,CWE-601," NO. The given Python code does not contain any open redirect vulnerability as described in CWE-601. The code is not handling any user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site and using that link in a Redirect. Instead, it is handling internal data and performing database updates. The second code snippet provided is an unrelated function for finding the shortest bridge in a grid.",1338,87,3.475250244140625
81,CWE-264," The given code is not directly related to the provided code that was discussed as vulnerable. The first code snippet is about user authentication in OpenStack, while the second code snippet is about finding the shortest bridge between two islands in a 2D grid. They serve different purposes and have different vulnerabilities, if any.

Therefore, I cannot determine if the second code snippet is vulnerable or not based on the given information.",3588,91,3.969890594482422
82,CWE-78," YES, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the execution of arbitrary code using the `exec()` function. The code being executed is retrieved from an untrusted source (`config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`), making it susceptible to OS command injection attacks as described in CWE-78.",1339,81,3.3891921043395996

87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that is inconsistent with how the ultimate destination entities will process them. Instead, it is a Python function that processes a video dictionary and returns a dictionary with some video metadata.",1999,86,3.6045331954956055
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter passed to the urlencode function.
