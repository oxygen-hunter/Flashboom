The code checks if there is an admin user present before deleting a user, but it does not check if the user trying to delete another user is an admin or not. This means that any user can delete other users if there is no admin user present.",2300,81,3.414375066757202
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve making HTTP requests to user-supplied URLs. Instead, it uses a hardcoded Dropbox URL to retrieve a file.",999,51,2.084087371826172
78,CWE-116," NO. The given code does not construct a shell command from user-supplied data directly, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-116. Instead, it constructs a list of command-line arguments and then appends a string to that list, which is not subject to the same vulnerabilities as constructing a shell command directly from user input.",1718,75,3.074604034423828
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it defines internal functions and calculates the result based on given inputs.",1232,51,2.108304500579834
80,CWE-601," NO. The given code does not contain any open redirect vulnerability as it does not use user-controlled input to redirect to an external site. Instead, it uses the `redirect` function to redirect to a predefined URL based on the `next` parameter or the topic's absolute URL.",1291,62,2.5240478515625
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly validate or check the tenant or user credentials before creating a new token. This can allow an attacker to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens with invalid or unauthorized credentials.",3541,59,2.771014451980591
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not involve constructing or executing OS commands using externally-influenced input. Instead, it defines and executes Python functions locally.",1292,48,2.014024257659912
83,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not use external input to construct a file path and does not appear to be vulnerable to path traversal attacks.,924,29,1.245530128479004
84,CWE-352," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-352 as it is not handling user input or request bodies in an insecure manner. Instead, it is defining and calling functions, and using the `json` module for parsing JSON data.",1597,57,2.3926239013671875
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input or data from an untrusted source in an insecure manner. Instead, it is validating JSON data and calling a function `config.valid_exclude_list()` to validate regular expressions.",957,68,2.7548325061798096
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for the function `data_received` does not contain an infinite loop or a condition that cannot be reached, as required for CWE-835 vulnerability. The code is parsing incoming data and checking for proper header size and body size, and if the data is not complete, it returns without entering the loop. If the data is complete, it processes the data and moves on to the next iteration of the while loop with an updated buffer. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-835.

The `findProductsOfElements` function is not related to the given vulnerability and does not contain any infinite loops or conditions that cannot be reached. It is a separate function that calculates the product of certain elements based on binary search and bitwise operations.",1168,169,6.67939567565918
87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to act as an intermediary HTTP agent and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that could allow for smuggling of messages. Instead, it is a Python function that processes video data and returns a dictionary with various video metadata.",1952,61,2.589185953140259
88,CWE-79," The `_get_unauth_response` function is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is due to the fact that the error message passed as the `reason` parameter is not properly escaped before being included in the response. This allows an attacker to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser.

Therefore, the answer is 'YES' and the vulnerability is of type 1: Reflected XSS.",2222,102,4.162127733230591
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations using user-controlled input, and hence it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) attacks.",973,38,1.6555676460266113
90,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations and does not construct file paths using user-controlled input, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or any other file-related vulnerabilities.",966,50,2.0295541286468506
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to receive a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieve the contents of this URL without sufficient validation. Instead, it performs internal calculations and returns the result of those calculations.",967,46,1.8902790546417236
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded directory structure.",1019,51,2.081328868865967
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations and does not construct file paths using user-controlled input. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or any other file-related vulnerabilities.",1012,51,2.0705225467681885
94,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in a way that could lead to server-side request forgery (SSRF). Instead, it defines several helper functions for binary search and calculating the number of set bits in an integer, and uses these functions to find the products of elements in a list.",1013,83,3.3068456649780273
95,CWE-79," NO.

The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users. Instead, it is validating expected values against the output of a database query, and does not involve any user-supplied data being reflected back into the response.",2601,77,3.4115936756134033
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions. The code does not involve retrieving the contents of a URL or similar request from an upstream component, nor does it involve sending requests to unexpected hosts or ports. Instead, it only performs database queries and operations based on the given input.",1622,83,3.366450309753418
97,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions. The code does not involve retrieving the contents of a URL or similar request from an upstream component, nor does it involve sending requests to unexpected hosts or ports. Instead, it only involves querying the local database and creating new database objects based on input.",1622,87,3.587224006652832
98,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it processes internal variables and calls helper functions.",1490,52,2.191549062728882
99,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it processes internal variables and calls helper functions.",1490,52,2.2264437675476074
100,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it processes local file paths and database operations.",2018,52,2.2634871006011963
