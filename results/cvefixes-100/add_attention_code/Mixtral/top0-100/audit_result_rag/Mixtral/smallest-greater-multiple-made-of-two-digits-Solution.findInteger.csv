75,CWE-918," The given code for the function `_delete_user` is not directly related to the provided function `findInteger`. Therefore, I cannot determine if the `_delete_user` function is vulnerable based on the given information.

However, I can evaluate the `findInteger` function for potential vulnerabilities. Based on the provided code, the `findInteger` function does not appear to have any obvious vulnerabilities. It is a simple implementation of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm to find an integer within a given range. The function takes an integer `k` and two digits `digit1` and `digit2`, and returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k` that has the first digit equal to `digit1` and the second digit equal to `digit2`. The function uses constant time and space complexity, and does not involve any external inputs or dependencies. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or any other type of vulnerability based on the given code.",1957,221,8.70717740058899
76,CWE-284," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper access control checks. In the function `_delete_user`, an admin user is deleting another user's data based on the condition that there exists another admin user. However, there is no check to ensure that the calling user is an admin user. This means that any user can call this function and delete other users' data if there is no admin user present. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege and can lead to unintended data deletion.",2099,115,4.645371675491333
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve making a request to an untrusted source or modifying a URL in a way that could lead to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Instead, it retrieves a Dropbox share link and uses it to download a file. The link is obtained from a trusted source (the Dropbox API) and is not modified in the code.",798,94,3.801283359527588
78,CWE-116," Yes, it is vulnerable. The issue is that the `plugin_names` argument is concatenated with the command string using the `join()` method without any form of escaping. This means that if an attacker supplies malicious input for `plugin_names`, it could potentially be executed as part of the shell command. This is a classic example of command injection vulnerability.",1517,80,3.245143175125122
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it checks for the presence of a session and extracts user information from it.",1031,53,2.156507968902588
80,CWE-601, NO. The given code does not contain any functionality that would allow for an attacker to redirect the request to a malicious site. The code only performs some data manipulation and rendering.,1090,39,1.6940500736236572
81,CWE-264," Yes, it is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly validate or check the tenant or user credentials before creating a new token. This can allow unauthorized users to create new tokens and bypass intended authorization restrictions. The code also does not implement token expiration, which can further exacerbate this vulnerability.",3340,72,3.2779223918914795
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not construct or modify OS commands using externally-influenced input. Instead, it executes a local file using the config.retrieveBoilerplateFile() function, which is not directly related to OS command injection.",1091,66,2.673220634460449
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve handling file paths or external input that could be used to traverse outside of a restricted directory. Instead, it is a method definition for a class with no relation to file I/O operations.",723,68,2.6799449920654297
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE-2021-32677 and CWE-352. The code is a test function for a FastAPI application and it does not involve handling user requests or parsing JSON data without checking the content-type header.,1396,69,2.799426555633545
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input or data from an untrusted source in an insecure manner. Instead, it is validating JSON data and calling a function `config.valid_exclude_list()` to validate regular expressions.",756,68,2.743344306945801
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for the function `data_received` does not contain an infinite loop as described in the CWE-835 vulnerability. The loop in the code exits when the buffer does not contain any data, or when an exception is raised during message parsing. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the described Denial of Service attack.

The `findInteger` function is not related to the vulnerability discussion and does not contain any infinite loops either.",967,101,3.9992361068725586
87,CWE-444," Yes, the code is vulnerable. The issue is that the'smuggle_url' function call allows for the passing of arbitrary 'http_headers' to be included in the HTTP request to Vimeo's server. This could potentially allow an attacker to smuggle malicious headers, such as setting a Referer header to a malicious URL, which could lead to unintended data leakage or other attacks. The use of the'smuggle_url' function in this way is inconsistent with how the ultimate destination (Vimeo's server) will interpret the headers, and could allow for smuggling of malicious messages.",1751,138,5.519235849380493
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error URL. The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute malicious scripts in the context of the web application.",2021,66,2.783822774887085
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations using user-controlled input, and hence it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) attacks.",772,38,1.5693914890289307
90,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input.

91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input that could be used to construct URLs or similar requests to unexpected hosts or ports.

92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing a file path using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded file path to serve static files using the Flask send\_file function.",818,64,2.540623903274536
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing a file path using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded file path to serve static files using the Flask `send_file` function.",811,66,2.596626043319702
94,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in a way that could lead to SSRF or other types of attacks. Instead, it is a simple function for finding an integer that satisfies certain conditions.",812,62,2.495060682296753
95,CWE-79," Based on the given code, the `test_custom_field_table_render` function is not directly vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks as defined in the CWE-79 description provided. The function is not handling user-controllable input in a way that would allow for the injection of malicious scripts into the output. Instead, it is comparing expected and actual values of custom columns in a table, which is not related to user input or output generation.

However, it is important to note that the code snippet provided does not represent the entire application, and other parts of the codebase might be vulnerable to XSS attacks or other security issues. It is always a good practice to follow secure coding guidelines and validate all user input before rendering it in the output.",2400,166,6.598101615905762
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions.
