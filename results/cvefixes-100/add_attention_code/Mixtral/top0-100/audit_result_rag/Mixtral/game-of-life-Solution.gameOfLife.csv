78,CWE-116," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-116 as it does not involve constructing or passing shell commands. Instead, it constructs a list of command-line arguments and appends them to a list, which is then used to create a list of elements for the command to be executed. There is no evidence of user input being directly included in the command construction or execution process.",1620,86,3.532005786895752

82,CWE-78," Based on the given code, the function `load` is vulnerable. The reason is that it executes arbitrary code retrieved from an untrusted source (`config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`) using the `exec` function, which is a classic example of OS command injection (CWE-78). The `load` function does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralize special elements in the input, allowing attackers to modify the intended OS command when it is sent to the downstream component (the `exec` function).",1194,120,4.721845626831055

86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for the `data_received` function does not contain an infinite loop, as it has proper exit conditions in place. The loop exits when the buffer is empty or an exception is raised during message parsing. The `gameOfLife` function, on the other hand, is not related to the vulnerability discussed in the initial code snippet and does not contain an infinite loop.",1070,85,3.3804454803466797
87,CWE-444, NO. The given code does not appear to act as an intermediary HTTP agent and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses. It is a Python function for parsing video data from a dictionary and returning a result in a specific format.,1854,51,2.206239700317383
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error URL. This can allow an attacker to inject and execute malicious scripts in the context of the web application.",2124,65,2.7726707458496094
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations using user-controlled input, and hence it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) attacks. The code only performs bitwise operations on a 2D array.",875,52,2.138530731201172
