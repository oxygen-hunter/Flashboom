For example, an attacker could provide a plugin name like `""; rm -rf / --sh` which would be concatenated with the rest of the command, effectively executing the `rm -rf /` command on the host system.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `plugin_names` argument should be properly escaped before being concatenated with the command string. One way to do this is by using a quoting mechanism such as shell quoting or Python's `shlex.quote()` function.",1586,173,6.851779460906982
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it checks for the presence of a session variable and constructs a label based on that information.",1100,56,2.433769941329956
80,CWE-601, NO. The given code does not contain any functionality that would allow for an attacker to redirect the request to a malicious site. The code only performs some data manipulation and rendering.,1159,39,1.6506543159484863
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration and allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining or leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account or for an account with a changed password.",3409,68,3.134770631790161
82,CWE-78," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the execution of arbitrary code using the `exec()` function. The code being executed is retrieved from an untrusted source (`config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`), making it susceptible to CWE-78 (OS Command Injection).",1160,78,3.150207042694092
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve handling file paths or external input in a way that could allow an attacker to traverse outside of the intended directory. Instead, it is a function for abbreviating a product name based on a given range of numbers.",792,75,2.9482369422912598
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE. It is a function definition for a method named 'test_post_broken_body' which is testing a POST request to an endpoint '/items/' with some data. It is not related to the FastAPI vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE.,1465,77,3.1842129230499268
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it does not involve handling user input or data from an untrusted source in an unsanitized manner, which is a common cause of this vulnerability. Instead, it is processing JSON data from 'agent_data' which is assumed to be trusted.",825,73,2.9472622871398926
86,CWE-835," The given code for the function `data_received` is similar to the vulnerable code you provided earlier, and it also exhibits an infinite loop vulnerability (CWE-835). The reason is that the `while self._buffer:` loop condition will never be false as long as there is data in `self._buffer`. If an attacker can manipulate the incoming data to cause an infinite loop in this function, they could potentially cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by consuming excessive resources.

However, the `abbreviateProduct` function is not related to the `data_received` function, and it does not contain any infinite loop vulnerabilities. Therefore, the answer for this code snippet is:

For `data_received`: YES
For `abbreviateProduct`: NO.",1036,181,7.130545616149902
87,CWE-444," Yes, the code is vulnerable. The issue is that the 'http_headers' dictionary is being passed to the'smuggle_url' function, which could potentially allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the request. This could lead to HTTP response smuggling attacks, where an attacker can send malicious responses to the client without the intermediary (in this case, the '_parse_video' function) being aware of it. This could result in unintended data being sent to the client, such as cookies or other sensitive information.",1820,117,4.77743935585022
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error URL. The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute malicious scripts in the context of the web application.",2090,66,2.8723409175872803
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations that could lead to path traversal vulnerabilities. The `backup_download` function only constructs a file path using the `os.path.join` method with a user-supplied filename, but it does not use that path to read or write files outside of the `settings.backup.folder` directory. Therefore, there is no vulnerability to CWE-22 in this code.",841,93,3.70098614692688
90,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations and does not construct file paths using user-controlled input. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or any other file-related vulnerabilities.",834,51,2.0613808631896973
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to receive or process user-controlled input that could be used to construct a URL or similar request to an unexpected destination. Instead, it uses a predetermined file path to send a file using the `send_file` function.",835,58,2.3363120555877686
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing a file path using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded file path to serve static files using the Flask send\_file function.",887,64,2.543677568435669
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not construct a pathname using user-controlled input, and therefore it is not vulnerable to path traversal attacks.",880,31,1.377363681793213
94,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in a way that could lead to SSRF attacks. Instead, it is a function for generating an abbreviated representation of a product number.",881,61,2.4808297157287598
95,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, specifically Reflected XSS. The vulnerability lies in the way user-controllable data (custom\_column\_expected) is being used to generate HTML code (rendered\_value) without proper encoding or escaping. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code in the custom\_column\_expected dictionary, which would then be rendered in the web page and executed in the context of the web server's domain.",2469,108,4.51965069770813
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions. The code does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs, which are common vectors for SSRF vulnerabilities. Instead, it only performs database queries and object manipulations within the application.",1490,79,3.316554069519043

98,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests using user-supplied data.

100,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it only deals with local file paths and database operations.",1886,54,2.314875364303589
