Instead, it deletes data from the local database based on the user ID provided as an argument.",1919,61,2.5865914821624756
76,CWE-284," Yes, the code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper access control checks. The code deletes a user and all associated data if the following condition is met:

1. There exists an admin user in the system.
2. The user to be deleted is not the ""Guest"" user.

However, there is no check to ensure that the user calling the `_delete_user` function is an admin user. This means that any user can call this function and delete any other user, including admin users, as long as the ""Guest"" user is not being deleted. This is a clear violation of the principle of least privilege and can lead to unintended consequences.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to CWE-284: Improper Access Control. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability to delete any user, including admin users, without proper authorization.",2061,194,7.636347532272339
77,CWE-918, NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server Side Request Forgery) as it is making a request to a Dropbox link and not constructing the URL from user input.,760,47,1.9103379249572754
78,CWE-116," Yes, it is vulnerable. The issue is that the `plugin_names` argument is concatenated with the command string using the `join()` method without proper escaping. This could allow an attacker to inject shell commands by providing specially crafted plugin names containing shell metacharacters.

For example, an attacker could provide a plugin name like `""; rm -rf / --sh` which would be concatenated with the rest of the command, effectively executing the `rm -rf /` command on the host system.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `plugin_names` argument should be properly escaped before being concatenated with the command string. One way to do this is by using a quoting mechanism such as shell quoting or Python's `shlex.quote()` function.",1479,175,6.81764817237854
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it checks for the presence of a session and adapts the label of a LoginButton based on the user's login status.",993,64,2.56642484664917
80,CWE-601, NO. The given code does not contain any functionality that would allow for an attacker to redirect the request to a malicious site. The code only performs data modification and rendering operations.,1052,38,1.605024814605713
81,CWE-264," Yes, it is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration and allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens or leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account or an account with a changed password.",3302,61,2.8017520904541016
82,CWE-78," Based on the given code, the `load` function is vulnerable. The reason is that it executes the retrieved code as Python code using `exec()`, which can lead to OS command injection if the retrieved code contains malicious commands. The `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile()` function is not shown in the code snippet, so it's not clear how it retrieves the code or whether it performs any input validation or sanitization. However, the fact that the code is being executed directly from an untrusted source makes it vulnerable to CWE-78.",1053,125,4.883178949356079
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to involve file operations or the construction of file paths, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or related vulnerabilities.",685,42,1.7387299537658691
84,CWE-352," NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE-2021-32677 and CWE-352. The code is for testing a FastAPI application's behavior when receiving a malformed JSON request, and it does not involve handling user input or authentication.",1358,68,2.7579097747802734
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it does not involve unsanitized user input or authentication schemes. The code is only validating JSON data and checking the validity of regular expressions, which does not directly relate to CWE-290.",718,64,2.5322937965393066
86,CWE-835," YES, the given code is vulnerable to an infinite loop. The vulnerability lies in the while loop in the data_received function where the condition for exiting the loop is not guaranteed to be met. If an exception is raised during message parsing, the loop will continue indefinitely as there is no check to ensure that the buffer is empty before entering the loop again. This could potentially lead to a Denial of Service attack as the server consumes excessive resources.",929,98,3.919821262359619
87,CWE-444," The given code is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE. The code snippet provided in the question is a Python function for parsing video data, and it does not involve intermediary HTTP agent functionality or handling of malformed HTTP requests or responses. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",1713,68,2.8247015476226807
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error URL.

89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations using user-controlled input, and hence it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) attacks. The code only performs matrix operations and does not involve file I/O operations.",734,54,2.168738842010498
90,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations using user-controlled input, and hence it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) attacks.

91,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input that could be used to construct URLs or similar requests to unexpected hosts or ports. Instead, it is a function for generating a matrix based on given input.",728,63,2.487795352935791
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing a file path using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded file path to serve static files using Flask's send_file function.",780,65,2.5909931659698486
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing a file path from user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded path to the'static' directory within the 'flask_restx' library.",773,67,2.638256788253784
94,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in the same way as the described vulnerability. Instead, it is a function for constructing a matrix based on given input.",774,57,2.277785301208496
95,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the use of `mark_safe()` or similar functions to render user-controllable input directly in HTML without proper escaping. In the given code, the `rendered_value` from the `bound_row` is directly compared to `col_expected_value` without any validation or escaping, which can lead to XSS vulnerabilities if the `col_expected_value` contains malicious scripts.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-2023-48705 and CWE-79, where the application does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.",2362,179,7.067123651504517
