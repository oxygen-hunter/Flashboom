The code is for a topic moderation function and does not involve any redirection to user-controlled inputs. The outerTrees function is unrelated to the given code and does not contain any functionality that would allow for an open redirect vulnerability either.,1346,85,3.435685396194458
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration, allowing remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining. The code does not check the validity or expiration of the provided tokens before creating new ones.",3596,68,3.139472007751465
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not involve constructing or executing OS commands using externally-influenced input. Instead, it focuses on sorting and processing points to find the convex hull.",1347,54,2.2630391120910645
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 as it does not involve constructing file paths from external input. Instead, it defines a function `load` that retrieves and executes a file named ""bs-extensions"" from a configuration object, which does not involve any path manipulation or user input.",979,71,2.812619686126709
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE. It is a function for finding the convex hull of a set of 2D points.,1652,41,1.797790765762329
85,CWE-290, NO. The given code does not appear to be related to the validation of agent data or the CWE-290 vulnerability described in the initial code snippet. The second code snippet is a separate function for calculating the convex hull of a set of 2D points.,1012,61,2.498671770095825
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for the function `outerTrees` does not contain an infinite loop or a loop with an exit condition that cannot be reached. It is a separate function that does not interact with the `data_received` function or the `Buffer` class, and it does not contain any recursive calls or loops that could potentially lead to an infinite loop. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the CWE-835 issue.",1223,93,3.6765685081481934
87,CWE-444, NO. The given code does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that could allow for smuggling attacks as described in the CWE-444 description. The code is focused on parsing video metadata and returning a dictionary with that information.,2007,66,2.7816274166107178
88,CWE-79," The given code for the function `_get_unauth_response` is not directly related to the `outerTrees` function provided, so I cannot evaluate its vulnerability based on this code alone. However, I will evaluate the `_get_unauth_response` function based on the provided description and CVE information.

YES, the `_get_unauth_response` function is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks as described in the CVE and CWE information. The function constructs a URL with user-controllable input (the `reason` parameter) and returns it as part of the error message without proper encoding or escaping. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the `reason` parameter, which would then be reflected back to the user in the error message and executed by their web browser.",2277,182,7.212432622909546
89,CWE-22," NO. The given Python code does not involve file operations using user-controlled input, and hence it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) attacks.",1028,39,1.6444463729858398
90,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations using user-controlled input, and hence it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) attacks.",1021,38,1.5982275009155273
91,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input that could lead to server-side request forgery (SSRF). Instead, it is a function for finding the convex hull of a set of 2D points.",1022,66,2.7017953395843506
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded path to the Flask-RESTX static directory.",1074,60,2.420989751815796
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it is a function for calculating the convex hull of a set of 2D points.",1067,62,2.5443575382232666
94,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in the same way as the vulnerable code example provided. Instead, it defines a function for calculating the convex hull of a set of points.",1068,61,2.465125799179077
95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users. Instead, it is a function for generating a convex hull from a list of 2D points.",2656,63,2.7757022380828857
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it only performs database queries and operations within the application.",1677,54,2.525007486343384
97,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs.

98,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs.
