However, it does make external requests to an LDAP server and handles the response, which could potentially introduce SSRF vulnerabilities if not properly handled.

To mitigate SSRF vulnerabilities, you should ensure that the LDAP server's URL is validated and sanitized before making the request. One common approach is to use a whitelist of trusted LDAP servers and only allow requests to those servers. Additionally, you can use libraries or frameworks that provide built-in protection against SSRF attacks.

The code snippet provided does not show how the LDAP server's URL is obtained or how it is validated, so it is impossible to determine if it is vulnerable based on the given information alone.

79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it is a function for calculating the number of subsequences of a given string with a maximum beauty score.",1489,59,2.480541467666626
80,CWE-601, NO. The given code does not contain any redirect functionality that could be exploited for open redirect vulnerabilities. The code only performs some data manipulation and rendering.,1548,34,1.5212185382843018
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration, allowing remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining or leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account or an account with a changed password.",3798,67,3.123070478439331
82,CWE-78," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the use of `exec()` function which executes the given code as a part of the current Python script. Since the code is retrieved from an untrusted source (`config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`), an attacker can inject arbitrary OS commands by manipulating the `code` variable. This can lead to OS command injection, which is a type of CWE-78 vulnerability.",1549,109,4.330509185791016
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve handling file paths or external input in a way that could allow an attacker to traverse outside of a restricted directory. Instead, it is a Python function for counting the number of subsequences of a given string with a maximum beauty score.",1181,77,3.122634172439575
84,CWE-352," NO. The given code is not related to the CWE-352 vulnerability described in the CVE. The code is for a function to count the number of subsequences of a given string with a maximum beauty, and it does not involve handling HTTP requests or JSON data.",1854,59,2.5055840015411377
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it does not involve any unsanitized user input or authentication schemes. Instead, it is a separate function for calculating the number of subsequences of a given string with a maximum beauty value.",1214,60,2.4949097633361816
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code does not contain an infinite loop, as it always checks the exit condition (len(buf) < header.body\_size) before entering the loop. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-835.",1425,51,2.1422359943389893
87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that is inconsistent with how the messages will be processed by the ultimate destination. Instead, it simply constructs and returns a dictionary with various video metadata.",2209,82,3.4180524349212646
88,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the URL query string. This can allow an attacker to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser.",2479,67,2.9001073837280273
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations and does not construct paths based on user input, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or any other file-related vulnerabilities.",1230,47,1.9730238914489746
90,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not involve file operations and is not related to the described vulnerability (CWE-22). It is a function for calculating the number of subsequences of a given string with a maximum beauty.,1223,48,2.0310912132263184
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to receive a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieve the contents of this URL without sufficient validation. Instead, it is a standalone Python function that uses local variables and does not involve any network requests or URL handling.",1224,56,2.361531972885132
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded path to the Flask-RESTX static directory.",1276,60,2.4474265575408936
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input.

94,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in the same way as the vulnerable code example provided. Instead, it is focused on implementing combinatorial mathematics and data structures.",1270,57,2.334484815597534
95,CWE-79," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks as it does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is served to other users. Instead, it is validating expected values against the output of a database query.",2858,58,2.6297125816345215
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as defined in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions.
