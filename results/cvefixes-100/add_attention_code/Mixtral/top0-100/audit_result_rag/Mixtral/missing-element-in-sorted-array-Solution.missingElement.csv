1. There exists an admin user in the system.
2. The user to be deleted is not the 'Guest' user.

However, there is no check to ensure that the user calling the `_delete_user` function is an admin user. This means that any user can call this function and delete other users, including admin users, if there is no admin user present in the system. This is a clear violation of the principle of least privilege and can lead to unintended consequences.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to CWE-284: Improper Access Control.",2104,169,6.811152458190918
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve making a request to an untrusted source based on user input. Instead, it makes a request to a known Dropbox URL based on the recipe's link.",803,58,2.3142757415771484
78,CWE-116," The given code for `prepare_plugin_docs_command` function does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-116 (Improper Escaping of Input). The function is constructing a command line argument list and appending it to the command to be executed. However, it is not directly taking user input to construct the command, but instead using pre-defined configuration options. Therefore, there is no risk of user-supplied data being misinterpreted as control information or metadata, and causing unintended operations.

The `missingElement` function provided in the code snippet is not related to the vulnerability assessment. It is a separate function that implements a method to find the missing number in a list using a binary search algorithm.",1522,156,6.214659690856934
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it is a function for finding a missing element in a list.",1036,50,2.095451593399048
80,CWE-601," NO. The given Python code does not contain any open redirect vulnerability as described in CWE-601. The code is not handling any user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site and using that link in a Redirect. Instead, it is handling internal data and performing database updates.",1095,66,2.692355155944824
81,CWE-264," Yes, it is vulnerable to CWE-264, Token Reuse, as the code does not properly check the expiration or revocation status of the tokens before creating new ones. The code only checks if the token exists or not, but it does not check if the token is still valid or not. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using an expired or revoked token to authenticate and bypass intended authorization restrictions.",3345,95,4.062363624572754
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not involve constructing or executing OS commands using externally-influenced input. Instead, it defines and executes a Python function locally.",1096,49,2.1150624752044678
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve handling file paths or external input in a way that could allow an attacker to traverse outside of the intended directory. Instead, it is a function for finding a missing element in a list.",728,68,2.6709320545196533
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE-2021-32677 and CWE-352. It is a function for finding a missing element in a list.,1401,50,2.1003355979919434
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not related to authentication or authorization schemes, and there is no evidence of unsanitized user input being processed. Instead, it is a function for validating JSON data and checking for valid regular expressions.",761,64,2.6032843589782715
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for the function `data_received` does not contain an infinite loop as described in the CWE-835 vulnerability. The loop in the code exits when the condition `self._buffer` is false, which is guaranteed to happen when all data has been processed. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to the described Denial of Service attack.

The `missingElement` function is not related to the given vulnerability and does not contain any vulnerabilities related to CWE-835.",972,112,4.3968586921691895
87,CWE-444," The given code for `_parse_video` function does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities, and it does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that is inconsistent with how the messages will be processed by the ultimate destination. Instead, it is just constructing a URL with some headers and returning it. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",1756,99,3.978416919708252
88,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter passed to the _get\_unauth\_response function. The vulnerable lines are:

error_params = urlencode({""error"": force_text(reason)})
login_url = force_str(reverse(""shuup_admin:login"") + ""?"" + error_params)

These lines construct a URL with the user-supplied ""reason"" parameter without proper validation or encoding, making it susceptible to XSS attacks if an attacker can manipulate the ""reason"" parameter to inject malicious scripts.",2026,149,5.961677312850952
89,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations using user-controlled input, and hence it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) attacks.",777,38,1.5726318359375
90,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not involve file operations and does not construct file paths using user-controlled input, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or any other file-related vulnerabilities.",770,50,2.0680346488952637

92,CWE-22," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded path to the Flask-RESTX library's static files.",823,64,2.5788750648498535
93,CWE-22," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded path to the'static' directory within the 'flask_restx' library.",816,67,2.63840389251709
94,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in the same way as the vulnerable code provided in the context. Instead, it is a function for finding a missing element in a list.",817,59,2.351417303085327
95,CWE-79," The given code for the function `test_custom_field_table_render` is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE information provided. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the described cross-site scripting vulnerability.

However, it's always a good practice to sanitize user-supplied data when rendering it in HTML or JavaScript contexts to prevent potential XSS attacks. In the given code, the data being rendered is hardcoded and not user-supplied, so there's no need for additional security measures in this specific case. But, if user-supplied data is being used in similar contexts, it's essential to sanitize it using appropriate methods like Django's `format_html()` or other similar libraries.",2405,167,6.67106819152832
96,CWE-918," NO. The given Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CWE-918 description provided.
