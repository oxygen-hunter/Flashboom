5,CWE-918," The given Python code for `add_security_headers` function is not directly related to the provided CVE-2022-0939 and CWE-918 description. Therefore, it cannot be evaluated based on the given information.

However, I can provide some general advice regarding the Content Security Policy (CSP) header in the code. The code is dynamically generating the CSP header by appending trusted hosts to the 'default-src' directive. This approach can be risky if the list of trusted hosts is not properly sanitized or validated. An attacker could potentially inject malicious hosts into the list, leading to SSRF vulnerabilities.

To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to use a predefined, static list of trusted hosts and validate the input before appending it to the CSP header. Additionally, consider using a library or framework that can help manage and validate the CSP header for you.

74,CWE-79," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation and sanitization of the 'bad_url' and 'good_url' variables in the 'test_security_check' function. This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks as the code does not properly check the URL schemes and allows malicious scripts to be injected.",2513,84,3.5302610397338867
75,CWE-918," The given code for `_delete_user` function is not directly related to the provided CVE-2022-0339 or CWE-918 description. The `_delete_user` function is checking for admin privileges before deleting a user, and it does not involve any URL or similar request that could be used for SSRF attacks. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",1938,88,3.6689412593841553
76,CWE-284," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper access control checks. In the function `_delete_user`, an admin user is deleting another user's data based on the condition that there exists another admin user. However, there is no check to ensure that the calling user is indeed an admin user. This means that any user can call this function and delete other users' data if there is no admin user present in the system. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege and can lead to unintended consequences.",2080,118,4.790616750717163
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve making a request to an untrusted source based on user input. Instead, it makes a request to a known Dropbox URL based on the recipe's link.",779,58,2.3903136253356934
78,CWE-116," The given code for `prepare_plugin_docs_command` function is not directly vulnerable to CWE-116 as it does not involve any user-supplied data that could lead to command injection.

86,CWE-835," The given code for `data_received` function is vulnerable. The reason is that the while loop condition `while self._buffer:` will never be false as the buffer is being continuously updated with new data. This creates an infinite loop, which can be exploited by an attacker to consume excessive resources.",948,64,2.5591678619384766
87,CWE-444," The given Python code for `_parse_video` function is not directly related to the CWE-444 vulnerability described in the provided context. The CWE-444 vulnerability is related to an intermediary HTTP agent not interpreting malformed HTTP requests or responses consistently with the ultimate destination, whereas the given code is just a Python function for parsing video data.

95,CWE-79," The given code snippet is not directly related to the provided Python code that is being reviewed for vulnerabilities. The given code snippet is a separate function definition for a different function called `kConcatenationMaxSum`. Therefore, it cannot be used to determine the vulnerability of the `test_custom_field_table_render` function.

To answer the original question, based on the provided context and code snippet, the answer is 'YES'. The code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the use of Django's `mark_safe()` function without proper validation or encoding of user-supplied data. The `rendered_value` variable obtained from the `get_cell()` method is expected to match the `col_expected_value` which may contain user-supplied data that is not properly sanitized. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `col_expected_value` which would then be executed in the context of the web server's domain when the page is rendered.",2381,233,9.261836528778076
