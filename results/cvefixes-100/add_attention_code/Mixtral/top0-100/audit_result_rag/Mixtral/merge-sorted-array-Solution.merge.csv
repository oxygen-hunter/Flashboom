1,CWE-918," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation and control flow checks on the `url` parameter, which can potentially allow an attacker to perform Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The code does not check if the URL is a valid one or not, and it does not restrict the scheme or the port number in the URL. This can allow an attacker to provide a malicious URL that points to an internal resource or an external one with a malicious payload, which can lead to unintended consequences such as data leakage, privilege escalation, or denial of service attacks.",1605,134,5.36866569519043

75,CWE-918," The given code for the function `_delete_user` is not directly related to the code for the function `merge`. Therefore, the vulnerability assessment for the `_delete_user` function does not affect the `merge` function.

However, based on the information provided, the `_delete_user` function appears to be vulnerable to CWE-918, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), as it performs queries based on user input (`content.id`) without sufficient input validation. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the queries and delete other users' data or perform unintended actions.

So, the answer is:

YES, the `_delete_user` function is vulnerable to CWE-918, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).",1891,175,6.9671242237091064
76,CWE-284," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper access control checks before deleting user data. An attacker or unauthorized user could potentially delete other users' data if they manage to gain admin privileges or exploit a vulnerability in the system. This is a classic example of CWE-284: Improper Access Control.",2033,79,3.351060390472412
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve making a request to an untrusted source based on user input. Instead, it makes a request to a known Dropbox link obtained from the `recipe.link` variable, which is not modified by user input.",732,69,2.7190566062927246
78,CWE-116," Yes, it is vulnerable. The issue is that the `plugin_names` argument is concatenated with spaces and then appended to the command line arguments without any form of escaping. This means that if an attacker supplies malicious input for `plugin_names`, they could potentially inject shell commands into the command executed on the host.

For example, if `plugin_names` is set to `""; rm -rf / --sh`, the command executed would be `ansible-doc-exec-path -j -s -t plugin_type --playbook-dir playbook_dir -M module_path ""/rm -rf / --sh""`. This would result in the `rm -rf /` command being executed on the host, deleting all files in the current directory.",1451,167,6.651582479476929
79,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs. Instead, it checks the session data of an incoming request to determine the user's login status.",965,55,2.215059757232666
80,CWE-601, NO. The given code does not contain any functionality that would allow for a user-controlled input to be used in a redirect. The code only performs database updates and renders a template. The `merge` function at the bottom of the code is not related to the `_moderate` function and does not contain any functionality that could lead to an open redirect vulnerability.,1024,79,3.1470305919647217
81,CWE-264," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264, as it does not properly implement token expiration and allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens or leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account or an account with a changed password.",3274,63,2.8892714977264404
82,CWE-78," The given code for the `load` function is vulnerable. The reason is that it executes the retrieved code as a part of the current process using the `exec` function, which can lead to OS command injection if the retrieved code contains malicious commands. The `merge` function provided in the question is not related to the vulnerability and can be ignored.",1025,76,3.0233588218688965
83,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to involve file operations or the construction of file paths, so it is not vulnerable to path traversal attacks.",657,31,1.2828335762023926
84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE. It is a function for merging two sorted lists.,1330,33,1.455209732055664
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it does not involve any unsanitized user input or authentication schemes. The code only deals with JSON parsing and merging two arrays, which do not involve any security vulnerabilities.",690,58,2.29470157623291
86,CWE-835," The given code for the function `data_received` is vulnerable. The reason is that the while loop at the beginning of the function, which is used to parse incoming data, does not have a clear exit condition. If an exception is raised during the parsing process, the loop will continue running indefinitely, leading to a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack as described in the CVE description.",901,87,3.493908166885376
87,CWE-444," The given code for `_parse_video` function does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent in the data flow between two entities, and it does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that is inconsistent with how the ultimate destination entities will process them. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",1685,81,3.395308256149292
88,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the URL with urlencode().

92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing a file path using user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded file path to serve static files using Flask's send_file function.",752,65,2.6950323581695557
93,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing a file path from user-controlled input. Instead, it uses a hardcoded path to the'static' directory within the 'flask_restx' library.",745,67,2.697051763534546
94,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in a way that could lead to SSRF or other types of attacks. Instead, it is a simple merging function for merging two sorted arrays.",746,62,2.4561448097229004
95,CWE-79," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, specifically Reflected XSS. The vulnerability lies in the way user-controllable data (custom\_column\_expected) is being rendered without proper escaping or validation.
