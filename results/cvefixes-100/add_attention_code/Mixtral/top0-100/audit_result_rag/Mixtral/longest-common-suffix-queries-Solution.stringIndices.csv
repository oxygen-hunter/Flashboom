The `stringIndices` function uses a Trie data structure to store and query indices of words in a list. It appears to be correct in its implementation, but there are some potential vulnerabilities that could arise from the usage of this function:

1. If the `wordsContainer` list contains user-supplied data, there is a risk of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by providing long words or a large number of words, which could cause the Trie to consume excessive memory and time to build.
2. If the `wordsQuery` list contains user-supplied data, there is a risk of an Information Disclosure attack by querying for words that should not be accessible to the user.
3. If the `wordsContainer` list is not properly sanitized or validated, there is a risk of an Input Validation attack by providing malicious words that could cause the Trie to behave unexpectedly or crash.

These vulnerabilities are not directly related to the `send_transactions` function, but they could potentially affect the security of the system if the `stringIndices` function is used inappropriately.

81,CWE-264," Yes, the code is vulnerable to CWE-264, Token Reuse, as it does not properly validate or check the expiration of tokens before using them to authenticate new requests. The code creates new tokens based on the provided token or credentials, without checking their validity or expiration status. This can allow an attacker to use expired or revoked tokens to bypass intended authorization restrictions.",3546,87,3.8388566970825195
82,CWE-78," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to OS command injection as it does not involve constructing or executing OS commands using externally-influenced input. Instead, it defines a Trie data structure and performs string indexing operations.",1297,53,2.199979066848755

84,CWE-352, NO. The given code is not related to the vulnerability described in the CVE-2021-32677 or CWE-352. The code is a function definition for a Trie data structure and does not involve handling HTTP requests or parsing JSON data.,1602,62,2.5788137912750244
85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input in an unsanitized manner. Instead, it is using a pre-defined JSON allowlist and validating the exclude list's regular expressions using a separate function.",962,61,2.5379230976104736
86,CWE-835," NO. The given code for the function `data_received` is not vulnerable to an infinite loop as it has a clear exit condition, which is when the buffer is empty (`while self._buffer:`). The `stringIndices` function, on the other hand, is not related to the vulnerability discussed in the initial code snippet and does not contain any infinite loop.",1173,79,3.264007568359375
87,CWE-444," NO. The given code does not appear to act as an intermediary HTTP agent and does not parse or interpret HTTP requests or responses in a way that could allow for smuggling of messages. Instead, it is parsing a dictionary-like object (`video`) and constructing a new dictionary based on that data.",1957,67,2.807101249694824
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error_params string. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the URL, which will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the page.",2227,77,3.3265326023101807
89,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not involve file operations and is not related to the described vulnerability (CWE-22). It is a function for building a Trie data structure and performing queries on it.,978,44,1.8159801959991455
90,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not involve file operations and is not related to the described vulnerability (CWE-22). It is a function for creating and querying a Trie data structure.,971,42,1.7372963428497314
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not involve handling user-controlled input that could lead to SSRF vulnerabilities. It is a separate function for creating and managing a Trie data structure, which is not related to file handling or network requests.",972,51,2.0664219856262207
92,CWE-22," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not involve constructing file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it defines a Trie data structure for a prefix tree and performs string indexing operations.",1024,60,2.453200578689575
93,CWE-22, NO. The given code does not involve file operations and is not related to the described vulnerability (CWE-22). It is a Python function for building a Trie data structure to find the index of words in a list based on given queries.,1017,53,2.242382764816284
94,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling user-controlled input in a way that could lead to server-side request forgery. Instead, it defines a Trie data structure for performing prefix matching on a list of strings.",1018,63,2.5333869457244873
95,CWE-79," The given code for the function `test_custom_field_table_render` is not directly related to the provided description of the vulnerability (CWE-79, Cross-Site Scripting). Therefore, it is not vulnerable based on the information provided.

However, the code snippet for the function `stringIndices` contains a custom Trie data structure implementation. It is essential to note that this code snippet is not related to the vulnerability in question and is not vulnerable on its own. The Trie data structure is used for indexing strings and does not involve user-controllable input or web pages.",2606,131,5.332650184631348
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs. Instead, it only performs database queries using the provided filter values, which are determined by the code itself and not user-supplied.",1627,68,2.856930732727051
97,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs.
