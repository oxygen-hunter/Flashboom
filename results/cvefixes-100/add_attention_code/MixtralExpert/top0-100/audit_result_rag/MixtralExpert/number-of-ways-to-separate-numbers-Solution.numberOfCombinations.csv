The function _delete\_user() doesn't seem to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it doesn't make any external requests based on user input. It performs a series of deletions based on the content ID and name, but it doesn't involve any URL or external requests.

The CVE-2022-0339 and CWE-918 vulnerabilities are related to SSRF attacks, but they are not relevant to this function as it doesn't handle any external requests.",2349,121,14.64459228515625
76,CWE-284," The function _delete\_user(content) is vulnerable to CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) because it does not check if the user invoking the function has the necessary permissions to delete another user. The function only checks if the user is not the ""Guest"" user, but it does not verify if the user is an admin or has the required role to delete other users. This can lead to unauthorized deletion of user accounts, causing a loss of data and unauthorized access to resources.

The second code snippet, numberOfCombinations(self, num), is not related to the _delete\_user(content) function and is not vulnerable to CWE-284.
