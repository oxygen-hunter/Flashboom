71,CWE-93," NO.

The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-93 as it does not use CRLF sequences in a special way that could be manipulated by an attacker. It is a binary search algorithm implementation for finding a range of indices in a sorted list, and does not contain any input validation or processing that could be exploited via a CRLF attack.",942,82,8.303256511688232
72,CWE-93," NO.

The code you provided is not vulnerable to CWE-93 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')). This vulnerability type is typically associated with input that is not properly sanitized and can contain CRLF characters, which can then be used to manipulate the behavior of a program, such as injecting HTTP response headers in web applications. The `filter` method only removes keys from a dictionary based on user input, and the `binarySearch` methods do not use user input in a way that would be vulnerable to CRLF injection.",940,130,13.577831745147705

75,CWE-918," NO.

The function _delete\_user is not vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not make any network requests based on user input or any other untrusted data. It is simply deleting some records from the local database based on the user ID provided as an argument.

The searchRange function is also not vulnerable to SSRF as it does not make any network requests. It is a utility function for performing binary search on a sorted list of integers.",2289,106,11.845933437347412
76,CWE-284," NO.

The function _delete\_user(content) is not vulnerable to CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) because it checks if the user to be deleted is not the ""Guest"" user and if there is at least one remaining admin user before proceeding with the deletion. This ensures that only eligible users are deleted and prevents unauthorized deletion of users.

The searchRange function is not related to the _delete\_user function and is not vulnerable to CWE-284 as it does not involve any access control mechanism.",2431,120,12.315099716186523
