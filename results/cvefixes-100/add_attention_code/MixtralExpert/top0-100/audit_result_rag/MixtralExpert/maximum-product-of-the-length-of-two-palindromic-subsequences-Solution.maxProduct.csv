The function `data_received` is not vulnerable to CWE-835 (Infinite Loop) because the loop condition `while self._buffer:` checks if `self._buffer` is an empty string or not. If `self._buffer` is an empty string, the loop will terminate. Therefore, there is an exit condition that can be reached, which means it is not an infinite loop.

The `maxProduct` function is a separate function that is not related to the `data_received` function and it does not contain any loops that could potentially be infinite. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-835 either.",1184,144,15.149584531784058
