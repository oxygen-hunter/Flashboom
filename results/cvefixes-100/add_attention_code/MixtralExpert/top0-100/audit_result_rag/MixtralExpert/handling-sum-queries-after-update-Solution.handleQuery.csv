The function `_hkey` only performs a title case conversion and a character replacement on the input string, it does not involve any parsing or processing of CRLF sequences. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-93.",1492,55,6.902949094772339
71,CWE-93," NO.

The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-93 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')) as it does not use CRLF sequences in any way. It is a segment tree implementation that performs some calculations based on input lists and queries. The vulnerability you mentioned, CVE-2016-9964, is related to the redirect() function in the bottle.py library, which incorrectly handled CRLF sequences. However, the code provided here is unrelated to the bottle.py library and the vulnerability in question.",1538,135,15.235045433044434

The code you provided is not vulnerable to CWE-93 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')) because it does not use CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element in any input. It is a segment tree implementation that performs some arithmetic operations based on the input queries. The vulnerability you mentioned, CVE-2016-9964, is specific to the redirect() function in bottle.py, which mishandles CRLF sequences in a particular context. The provided code does not have a similar issue.",1536,137,14.785309076309204

The code you provided does not have any signs of CWE-93 vulnerability. It does not use CRLF sequences as a special element, nor does it neutralize or incorrectly neutralize CRLF sequences from inputs. It operates only on integers and does not manipulate or process any user-supplied data that could contain CRLF sequences.",1532,80,8.626559734344482
74,CWE-79," NO.

The code provided does not contain any web request or response handling, and it does not process any user-supplied data that gets reflected back into the application. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to Cross-site scripting (XSS) or any other vulnerabilities related to user-controllable input. The code is a segment tree implementation for handling queries, and it does not have any connection to the initial code provided for context.",3452,93,9.442137002944946
75,CWE-918," NO.

The code provided does not make any network requests or use any user-supplied input in a way that would be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). It is a function for handling queries on an array of numbers and does not interact with any external systems or user input that could be manipulated to perform SSRF attacks.",2885,75,8.071369409561157
76,CWE-284," NO.

The function _delete\_user() checks if the user to be deleted is not the ""Guest"" user and if there is at least one admin user remaining in the system before proceeding with the deletion. This ensures that only non-guest users can be deleted by an admin user, providing proper access control and addressing the CWE-284 vulnerability.

The provided SegmentTree class is a separate implementation that deals with a completely different functionality, so it is not relevant to the discussion of the _delete\_user() function's vulnerability.",3027,122,13.812117338180542
77,CWE-918," NO.

The function `get_file` provided in the first code block is vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) because it makes a GET request to the `recipe.link` without properly validating or sanitizing the input. This can allow an attacker to craft a URL that can access sensitive information on the internal network.

However, the function `handleQuery` provided in the second code block does not make any external requests and does not take any user input, so it is not vulnerable to SSRF or any other type of injection attack. This function only performs in-memory operations on the input lists and does not interact with any external systems.",1726,143,15.939742803573608
78,CWE-116," NO.

The function `prepare_plugin_docs_command` is not vulnerable to CWE-116 because it does not perform any encoding or escaping of user-supplied data that is then used in a structured message or command. It only checks the types and validity of the input arguments and constructs a command based on these inputs, but it does not include any user-supplied data in the command.

The `handleQuery` function and the `SegmentTree` class defined later in the code are not related to the `prepare_plugin_docs_command` function and do not affect its vulnerability. They define a data structure and methods for querying and updating the data structure, but they do not handle user input or construct commands.",2445,160,18.7994122505188

The given Python code is not vulnerable to CWE-601 (Open Redirect) as it does not contain any functionality related to redirecting a user to an external URL based on user-supplied input.

The function authenticate is not vulnerable to CWE-264 as it does not implement token expiration or have any issues related to management of permissions, privileges, and other security features that are used to perform access control.

The given code is a modified version of the previous code, but the functionality and security aspects of the code remain the same. The vulnerability CVE-2012-3426 is not related to this code snippet.

The second code snippet is a function for handling queries and is not related to authentication or token management, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-264.",4243,140,16.448030471801758

The provided code is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) as it does not construct file paths using external input.

84,CWE-352," NO.

The code provided does not include any web server code or any request handling code, so it is not vulnerable to CSRF attacks or any other web-based vulnerabilities. The code defines a custom Segment Tree data structure and uses it to process some queries on some input data. The vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE you provided is related to web servers and request handling, so it is not applicable to this code.",2324,93,9.92430067062378
85,CWE-290," NO.

The function `validate_agent_data` that you provided is indeed vulnerable to the CWE-290 vulnerability, as it does not properly validate user input. However, the `handleQuery` function that you added in your follow-up question is not vulnerable to the same type of vulnerability.

The `handleQuery` function does not take any user input that is not properly validated, so there is no opportunity for an attacker to exploit the function. The function takes three arguments, `nums1`, `nums2`, and `queries`, which are all either integers or lists of integers. These arguments are not user-facing, so there is no way for an attacker to provide malicious input.

Therefore, the `handleQuery` function is not vulnerable to the CWE-290 vulnerability.",1684,186,18.649744987487793
86,CWE-835," NO.

The function `data_received` is not vulnerable to CWE-835 (Infinite Loop) because the loop condition `while self._buffer:` checks if the buffer is empty, and the function removes data from the buffer in each iteration, so the loop will eventually terminate when there is no more data in the buffer.

The second code snippet `handleQuery` is a different function that implements a segment tree data structure and handles queries on it. It does not contain any loops that could potentially become infinite, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-835.",1888,129,16.360286235809326
87,CWE-444," NO.

The function `_parse_video` is not vulnerable to CWE-444 because it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent and does not interpret HTTP requests or responses. Instead, it parses a video dictionary and extracts various pieces of information from it. The potential vulnerability in the `smuggle_url` function is not visible in this code snippet.

On the other hand, the `handleQuery` function is a completely different function that has no relation to the `_parse_video` function and does not handle HTTP requests or responses. It is a segment tree implementation that performs range queries and updates on an array of integers. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-444 either.",2677,159,15.471924543380737

The function `backup_download` is not vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not make any network requests using user-supplied input. It simply constructs a file path by joining the `settings.backup.folder` and the `filename` provided as an argument, and then sends the file at that location for download. There is no way for an attacker to control the URL or host being accessed, so there is no possibility for SSRF or any other network-based attacks.",1694,109,12.340723991394043
