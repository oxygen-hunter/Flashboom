The vulnerability is related to CWE-79 because the code is not neutralizing user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users. In this case, the user-controllable input is the `col_expected_value` variable, which is used to set the `rendered_value` variable. If an attacker can control the value of `col_expected_value`, they can inject malicious code into the web page, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.

For example, if `col_expected_value` is set to `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, the resulting `rendered_value` will be the same, and an alert box with the message ""XSS"" will be displayed when the web page is rendered.

To prevent this vulnerability, the code should sanitize the `col_expected_value` variable before using it to set the `rendered_value` variable. This can be done using a function like `django.utils.html.escape()` to escape any HTML characters in the input.",2235,256,27.887135982513428
