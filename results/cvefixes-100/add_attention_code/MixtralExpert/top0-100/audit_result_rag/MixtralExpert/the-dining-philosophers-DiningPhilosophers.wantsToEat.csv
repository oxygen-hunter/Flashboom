The function `is_private_address` is vulnerable to CWE-918 because it receives a URL as input, extracts the hostname, and then retrieves the IP address of that hostname using `socket.gethostbyname`. This means that an attacker could potentially provide a hostname that resolves to a private IP address, allowing them to bypass access controls and access resources on the internal network.
