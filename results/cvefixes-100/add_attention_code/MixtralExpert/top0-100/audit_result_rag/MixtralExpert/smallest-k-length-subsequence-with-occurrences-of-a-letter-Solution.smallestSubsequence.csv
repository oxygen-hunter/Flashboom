1,CWE-918," Answer: YES

The function get\_response() is vulnerable to CWE-918 because it does not sufficiently ensure that the URL being requested is the expected destination. The function takes a URL as an input and sends a request to that URL without verifying its origin or contents. An attacker can exploit this by providing a URL that points to an internal system or a different protocol, potentially bypassing access controls and accessing sensitive information. The is\_private\_address() function only checks if the URL is a private address, but it does not verify if the URL is internal or external, leaving it vulnerable to SSRF attacks.",1692,135,14.53861689567566
2,CWE-918," NO.

The function `is_private_address` is not vulnerable to CWE-918 because it does not make any network requests based on user-supplied input. It resolves the hostname from the input URL and checks if the IP address is a private address, but it does not send any requests to that IP address. Therefore, there is no risk of the function being used as a proxy to access unintended hosts or ports.

On the other hand, the function `smallestSubsequence` is not related to network requests or URLs, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-918 either. It is a string manipulation function that returns the smallest subsequence of a given string that contains at least `k` occurrences of a specified letter, with at most `repetition` repetitions of consecutive letters.",1068,181,18.373777866363525
3,CWE-601," NO.

The function `smallestSubsequence` does not deal with web requests or redirects, so it is not vulnerable to the issue described in CWE-601. It is a function that determines the smallest subsequence of a string that contains at most `k` occurrences of a specified letter, with at most `repetition` consecutive occurrences of that letter. It does this by iterating through the string and maintaining a stack of characters and a `suffix` array that keeps track of the number of times the specified letter appears in the suffix of the string ending at each position. It then constructs the smallest subsequence by iterating through the string in reverse and popping characters from the stack when necessary to satisfy the constraints on the number of occurrences of the specified letter.",2625,170,18.910665035247803
4,CWE-601," NO.

The function `smallestSubsequence` is not vulnerable to CWE-601 as it does not perform any redirects based on user-controlled input. It is a function that determines the smallest subsequence of a string `s` that contains at least `k` occurrences of a specified letter, with at most `repetition` repetitions of the same letter in a row. The function does not interact with any external URLs or links, so there is no risk of phishing attacks or unintended redirects.",1469,117,12.212767362594604

The function `get_file` is the only one provided and it is the same as the vulnerable function with the exception of the function name and the first line which assigns the recipe link. The vulnerability in the original function is due to the use of user input (recipe.link) in the requests.get() function without proper validation, potentially allowing for SSRF attacks. In this new function, the same user input (recipe.link) is used, but since the function is not being called and there is no additional context provided, it is not possible to determine if the input is being properly validated or not. However, since the function is the same, I will assume that the input is being used in the same way and therefore I will answer 'YES'.

YES, the function `smallestSubsequence` is also vulnerable to SSRF attacks because it uses the same unvalidated user input (recipe.link) in the `requests.get()` function.
