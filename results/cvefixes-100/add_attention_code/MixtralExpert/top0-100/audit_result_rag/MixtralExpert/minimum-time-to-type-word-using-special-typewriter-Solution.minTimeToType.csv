The provided Python code does not contain any authorization checks, so it is not directly vulnerable to CWE-863. It only defines a constructor that creates a signer object using a given private key and sets the public key as an attribute. The `minTimeToType` method calculates the minimum time to type a given word based on the difference between ASCII values of characters, but it does not perform any authorization checks.

However, it is important to note that the vulnerability of the first code snippet you provided (CWE-863) is related to incorrect authorization checks in the OpenZeppelin Contracts for Cairo library, which is a completely different codebase.

The function does not perform any string formatting or concatenation on untrusted user input to create command line arguments, so there is no way for an attacker to inject arbitrary commands or escape the intended command boundaries. The function only appends the user-provided plugin names to the command line arguments list after ensuring that it is a list and its elements are strings. Therefore, there is no CWE-116 vulnerability in this code.

The `minTimeToType` function at the end of the code snippet is not related to the `prepare_plugin_docs_command` function and is not vulnerable to CWE-116 or CVE-2021-4041.
