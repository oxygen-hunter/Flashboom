Therefore, it doesn't have any vulnerabilities related to CRLF injection.

The `replace` function that was provided earlier is vulnerable to CWE-93 because it uses the `str` function on the `value` argument without checking if it contains any CRLF sequences.

76,CWE-284," Yes, the code is vulnerable to CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). The vulnerability exists because the code does not check if the user invoking the `_delete_user` function has the necessary permissions to delete a user. It only checks if the user to be deleted is not the ""Guest"" user and if there is at least one admin user remaining. However, it does not check if the user invoking the function is an admin user or has the required privileges to delete other users. This can lead to unauthorized deletion of user accounts, which is a form of improper access control.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to add an access control check at the beginning of the function to ensure that only authorized users with the required privileges can invoke the function. For example, you can add a check to ensure that the user invoking the function is an admin user. This can be done by querying the database to check if the user has the admin role before executing the rest of the function.",2148,220,24.265418529510498
