The function `minStartingIndex` takes two string arguments `s` and `pattern` and returns the starting index of the first occurrence of `pattern` as a substring in `s`, or `-1` if no such occurrence exists. This function does not involve any network communication, user input, or redirection, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-601 or any other web vulnerability.",974,93,9.941771745681763
69,CWE-93," NO.

The code you provided is not vulnerable to CWE-93 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')). This code defines a method `minStartingIndex` that calculates the starting index of the first occurrence of a pattern in a string, using a z-algorithm. It does not involve any input from an untrusted source, so there is no opportunity for an attacker to inject CRLF sequences.

The vulnerable code you provided earlier is a method that sets the value of an item in a dictionary, where the key is hashed using a custom hashing function `_hkey`. This method is vulnerable because it does not neutralize CRLF sequences in the key input, potentially allowing an attacker to inject CRLF sequences and manipulate HTTP headers in a CRLF injection attack.",704,185,17.971978187561035
70,CWE-93," NO.

The function `minStartingIndex` takes two string arguments `s` and `pattern`, and returns the starting index of the first occurrence of `pattern` in `s` where the match is not overlapping with the previous match. The function does not perform any user input validation, but the vulnerability described in CWE-93 is related to the mishandling of CRLF sequences in the context of HTTP requests and responses, which is not relevant to this function. Therefore, the function is not vulnerable to CWE-93.",660,119,12.145929336547852
71,CWE-93," NO.

The function `minStartingIndex` does not use the `append` method, so it is not vulnerable to the same CWE-93 vulnerability. The `append` method is only vulnerable if it is used in a way that allows untrusted user input to be interpreted as a CRLF sequence, which is not the case in this function.",706,79,7.5743536949157715
72,CWE-93," NO.

The function `minStartingIndex` and its helper function `z_function` do not contain any logic that handles user input or performs any operations that could be vulnerable to CWE-93. The functions only perform calculations on pre-defined inputs and do not interact with any external systems or user inputs that could introduce the CRLF sequence. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-93.",704,89,8.483373880386353

The function `minStartingIndex` does not use the `replace` function and does not perform any string manipulation that could be vulnerable to CWE-93.",700,40,4.597656488418579
74,CWE-79," Yes, it is vulnerable. The function minStartingIndex takes in user controlled inputs s and pattern, but it does not properly neutralize or sanitize these inputs before using them in the z_function. This could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) or other vulnerabilities if untrusted data is used in the inputs. This is in line with the description of CWE-79, as the untrusted data is being placed in output (the generated z\_function) without proper neutralization.

The test\_security\_check function, while not directly vulnerable, is also at risk because it calls minStartingIndex with user-supplied inputs. This means that if minStartingIndex is not properly secured, test\_security\_check could also lead to vulnerabilities.

To mitigate the risk, it is recommended to sanitize or neutralize the user-supplied inputs before passing them to minStartingIndex, and to perform input validation to ensure that the inputs do not contain any malicious content.",2620,216,23.337966918945312

The function _delete\_user and minStartingIndex have no vulnerabilities related to CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)). The _delete\_user function only performs local operations based on the user content object and does not make any network requests based on user input. The minStartingIndex function calculates the minimum starting index of a pattern in a string and does not involve network requests or external inputs.",2053,95,10.38416600227356
76,CWE-284," Yes, the code is vulnerable to CWE-284. The vulnerability exists because the code does not properly restrict access to the deletion of a user based on the user's role. Specifically, the code checks if the user to be deleted is not the ""Guest"" user, but it does not check if the user initiating the deletion is an administrator. This means that any user, regardless of their role, can delete any other user as long as they know the user's ID. To fix this vulnerability, the code should first check if the user initiating the deletion has the appropriate privileges (i.e., is an administrator) before proceeding with the deletion.

Therefore, it's not possible to determine if it's vulnerable based on the information given.

However, the `load` function is still vulnerable to CWE-22 as it uses `exec()` to execute the code without proper input validation or sanitization, allowing arbitrary code execution.",819,138,13.407296180725098
