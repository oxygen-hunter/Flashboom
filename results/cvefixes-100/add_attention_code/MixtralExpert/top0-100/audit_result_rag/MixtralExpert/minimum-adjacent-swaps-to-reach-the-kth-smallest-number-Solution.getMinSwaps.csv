The function _moderate is not vulnerable to CWE-601 as it does not perform any redirects based on user input. The redirects it performs are either to the URL specified in the 'next' parameter of the POST request or to the absolute URL of the topic. Both of these URLs are either hardcoded or determined by the server, not the user, so they cannot be manipulated to perform an open redirect attack.

The getMinSwaps function is unrelated to the _moderate function and is not vulnerable to CWE-601 as it does not perform any redirects at all. It is a function for finding the minimum number of swaps required to sort an array of integers, and all its inputs and operations are numerical, so there is no risk of open redirect attacks.",1349,178,17.836605548858643
