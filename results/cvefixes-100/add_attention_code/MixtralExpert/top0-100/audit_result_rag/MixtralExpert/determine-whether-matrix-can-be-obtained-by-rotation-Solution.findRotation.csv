The function `create_transaction` doesn't show any signs of vulnerability related to CWE-203. It doesn't provide different responses or behave differently based on security-relevant information that could be exploited by an unauthorized actor.

The `findRotation` function is also not related to the previous discussion and is not vulnerable to CWE-203. It checks for a rotation of a matrix based on certain conditions, but it doesn't expose security-relevant information or behave differently based on unauthorized input.",1384,119,14.25400686264038

The function `gateway_postprocess` does not appear to contain the vulnerability type of CWE-203, which is information leakage due to inconsistent responses. This function only processes transactions and updates the payment object based on the type of transaction. There is no conditional behavior based on sensitive data or any inconsistent responses that could leak information.

As for the `findRotation` function, it is not related to the previous function and is used to check if a given matrix has a rotational symmetry with the target matrix. It does not contain any conditional behavior or inconsistent responses that could lead to information leakage. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-203.",1626,151,17.286789178848267

The function `findRotation` is not vulnerable to CWE-601 as it does not perform any redirects using user-controlled input. It takes two parameters `mat` and `target` which are both 2D lists of integers and checks if there is a rotation of `mat` that matches `target`. The vulnerability in the previous `make_homeserver` function is not related to this function, and it is a different type of vulnerability (CVE-2021-21273 related to making requests to internal infrastructure based on user-provided domains).",851,133,15.022333145141602

The function _hkey(s) only performs string manipulation by converting the first letter of the string to uppercase and replacing underscores with hyphens. It does not use CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, nor does it neutralize or incorrectly neutralize CRLF sequences from inputs. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-93.

The function findRotation, on the other hand, takes in two-dimensional lists of integers as input and performs a series of equality checks on the elements of the lists. It does not use CRLF or any other special element in a way that could lead to a vulnerability. Therefore, it is also not vulnerable to CWE-93.",537,163,18.878016710281372

The function replace in the first code snippet is vulnerable because it does not properly neutralize CRLF sequences from inputs, as described in the CWE-93 description. It is possible to inject CRLF sequences in the key or value parameters, which could lead to a security vulnerability.

However, the second code snippet, which contains the findRotation function, does not have any input validation or manipulation of user input, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-93. It only takes two parameters, mat and target, which are both lists of lists of integers, and performs some operations on them.

76,CWE-284," Yes, the code is vulnerable according to CWE-284: Improper Access Control. The vulnerability exists because the code does not check if the user invoking the function has the necessary permissions to delete a user. It only checks if the user is not named ""Guest"" and if there is at least one admin user remaining. However, it does not check if the user invoking the function is actually an admin user or has the required permissions to delete other users. This could allow an attacker to delete any user, not just themselves or the ""Guest"" user. To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the user invoking the function is an admin user before proceeding with the deletion process.",2072,151,14.88809585571289

The function `_get_unauth_response` does not appear to be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) as per CWE-79.
