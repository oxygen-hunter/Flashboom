Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-918. The function `get_response` does not validate the `url` parameter, which could be manipulated by an attacker to send requests to arbitrary external hosts or internal hosts, bypassing access controls and potentially leading to SSRF attacks. The `is_private_address` function, if implemented correctly, can prevent external hosts from being accessed, but it does not prevent internal hosts from being accessed, which is still a security risk.",1779,110,11.275495052337646
2,CWE-918," NO.

The code you provided is not vulnerable to CWE-918 because it does not make any network requests based on user-supplied input. The `is_private_address` function takes a URL as input, extracts its hostname, and checks if the corresponding IP address is a private address. However, it does not make any requests to the URL or its hostname.

The `isPrefixOfWord` function takes a sentence and a search word as input and checks if the search word is a prefix of any word in the sentence. It does not make any network requests or use user-supplied input in a way that could lead to SSRF or other vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",1155,166,17.141931533813477

The `isPrefixOfWord` function is not related to the `create_transaction` function and is not causing any vulnerability in this context. However, the `isPrefixOfWord` function itself has a potential issue. It calls a helper function `KMP` that compares a pattern (searchWord) to a text (sentence). The `KMP` function may reveal information about the pattern through timing differences based on the length of the common prefix between the text and the pattern. This could potentially be used in an attack to extract information about the pattern.

The `replace` method simply sets a value in a dictionary based on the input `key` and `value`. The `isPrefixOfWord` method checks if a given `searchWord` is a prefix of any words in the `sentence` string.
