It assumes that the 'allowlist' and 'exclude' keys exist in the dictionary and that their values can be passed directly to `json.loads` and `lists.get('exclude')` without proper sanitization.

However, the `maxSideLength` function is unrelated to `validate_agent_data` and does not handle any user input, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-290.

The `maxSideLength` function has a while loop that terminates when the `left` variable is greater than the `right` variable. The `left` variable is incremented in the `else` block of the `check` function, ensuring that the loop will terminate eventually.
