Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the described SSRF attack.

The function `gateway_postprocess` does not appear to contain any vulnerabilities related to CWE-203, which deals with observable discrepancies in product behavior or responses. This function only processes transactions and updates the payment object's properties based on the transaction type. There are no conditional statements that would expose security-relevant information based on the input.

However, I did notice that the `findWordsRecu` function was provided in addition to the `gateway_postprocess` function. I want to address that this function can be vulnerable to CWE-203 if used in a larger context where the `result` dictionary is exposed to an attacker. In the current form, the `findWordsRecu` function does not expose sensitive information directly, but if the `result` dictionary is used to indicate whether a word is in a dictionary or not, an attacker could potentially enumerate valid words by observing the timing differences between the existence and non-existence of words in the dictionary.
