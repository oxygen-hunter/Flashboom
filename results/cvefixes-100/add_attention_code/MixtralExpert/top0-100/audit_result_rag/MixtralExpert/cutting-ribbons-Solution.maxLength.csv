The provided Python code defines a class with two methods: `__init__` and `maxLength`. The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the class with a private key, which it uses to create a signer object and get the associated public key. The `maxLength` method implements a binary search algorithm to find the maximum length of a segment that can be cut from a list of integers, subject to a given constraint `k`.

The code does not appear to contain any authorization or access control checks, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). The vulnerability described in the CVE-2022-31153 description is related to the OpenZeppelin Contracts for Cairo library, which is not used in the provided code.

However, the `maxLength` function has a vulnerability related to integer overflow in the calculation of `right`. If the `sum(ribbons)` value is greater than the maximum integer value, and `k` is a small value, then `right` could overflow to a negative value. This could lead to an infinite loop in the `while` statement. To fix this, you can add checks to ensure that the intermediate values do not overflow. For example, you can check if `sum(ribbons)` is greater than the maximum integer value before calculating `right`.",775,180,18.429548740386963

However, the provided `maxLength` function is not related to the `send_transactions` function and does not contain any authorization checks either, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-863.

That being said, it is important to note that CWE-863 is a type of vulnerability that is related to authorization checks, and not all code contains authorization checks. Therefore, not all code will be vulnerable to CWE-863.

In the provided `send_transactions` function, there are no authorization checks being performed, so the question of whether the checks are being incorrectly applied does not arise. The function simply appears to be building and signing a transaction to be sent to a blockchain, without any checks on who is allowed to perform the transaction.

The `maxLength` function, on the other hand, is a completely unrelated function that calculates the maximum length of a segment that can be obtained by cutting a ribbon into multiple segments of a given length.
