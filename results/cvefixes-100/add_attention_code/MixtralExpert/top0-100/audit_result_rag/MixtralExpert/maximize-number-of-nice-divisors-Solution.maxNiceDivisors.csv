The code provided has no vulnerabilities related to CWE-918 or SSRF as it does not make any outbound network requests based on user-provided input.

The given code does not contain any authorization checks, so it is not directly vulnerable to CWE-863. It is a method for calculating the maximum number of divisors of a number given its prime factors, so its security would depend on the context in which it is used.",837,65,6.267315626144409

65,CWE-863," NO.

The function maxNiceDivisors is not vulnerable to the authorization bypass described in the CWE-863 vulnerability, because it does not perform any authorization checks. It is a pure mathematical function that calculates the maximum number of nice divisors of a number, given its prime factors. Therefore, it cannot have an incorrect authorization check.

The send\_transactions function, on the other hand, is a different story. It is unclear from the provided code snippet whether it is vulnerable to CWE-863 or not, because the implementation of the `account` and `signer` objects is not shown. If these objects perform authorization checks correctly, then the function may not be vulnerable. However, if they have authorization vulnerabilities, then the function may inherit those vulnerabilities.

Therefore, while the maxNiceDivisors function is not vulnerable to CWE-863, the send\_transactions function may or may not be vulnerable, depending on the implementation of the `account` and `signer` objects.",1143,231,23.28176522254944

The code provided does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-203 as it does not contain any conditional statements or responses that would expose security-relevant information based on the input. It simply creates a new `Transaction` object with the provided parameters and returns it. The `maxNiceDivisors` function at the end of the code snippet is also unrelated and is not called within the `create_transaction` function, so it does not impact the vulnerability assessment of the `create_transaction` function.",1456,115,12.180391550064087

The code you provided is not vulnerable to CWE-93 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')). This code defines a method `__setitem__` that sets a value in a dictionary, and a method `maxNiceDivisors` that calculates the maximum product of divisors of a given number. Neither of these methods is vulnerable to CRLF injection because they do not use any user-supplied input to construct a string that will be used in a HTTP response header or similar context where CRLF injection could be used to exploit the vulnerability.",653,136,15.803133249282837

The function `filter` and the `maxNiceDivisors` function are not related, and the `maxNiceDivisors` function does not use any user input to generate output, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-93 or CVE-2016-9964.

The code you provided is not vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, which is what CWE-79 is about. This code is testing for security vulnerabilities in URLs, but the code itself does not contain any input that could be manipulated by a user. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-79.

The code that you described as vulnerable in the first part of your question is vulnerable because it uses the `is_safe_url` function incorrectly, which can lead to XSS attacks. However, the code you provided in the second part of your question is a different function that calculates the maximum number of nice divisors of a number, and it does not have any input that is vulnerable to XSS attacks.",2569,165,17.476617574691772

76,CWE-284," Yes, the code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is related to the CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) description you provided. The code does not check if the user performing the deletion has the necessary permissions to do so, potentially allowing any user to delete any other user as long as there is at least one admin user remaining. This can be exploited to delete the admin user, leaving no admin users in the system, which can lead to a denial of service.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should add proper access control checks to ensure that only users with the appropriate permissions can delete other users. This can be done by checking the role of the user performing the deletion, and ensuring that it has the necessary administrative privileges.",2144,159,18.971389770507812

The function `get_file` is indeed vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CWE-918, because it makes an HTTP request to a user-supplied URL without proper validation or sanitization.

The function `prepare_plugin_docs_command` does not have any vulnerabilities related to CWE-116. It checks the type of `plugin_names` and the value of `response_format` and raises an error if the input is invalid. It then constructs a command by appending the inputs to `self.cmdline_args` and `self.command`. However, it does not use any user input to construct a structured message for communication with another component, so there is no improper encoding or escaping of data.

The second function `maxNiceDivisors` is not related to the first function and is not vulnerable to CWE-116 either. It calculates the maximum product of factors of a given number, but it does not perform any encoding or escaping of data.",1562,178,19.92727303504944

The function `_check_login_status` and the `maxNiceDivisors` function are not related. The vulnerability in the first code you provided was due to insufficient validation of user-supplied URLs in the `/proxy` route, which is not present in the second code.

The code you provided is not vulnerable to CWE-835 because the loop has an explicit exit condition that checks if `self._buffer` is empty. This condition can be reached because it is checked before each iteration, and if the condition is met, the loop will be exited. Therefore, the loop is not an infinite loop and the code is not vulnerable to CWE-835.
