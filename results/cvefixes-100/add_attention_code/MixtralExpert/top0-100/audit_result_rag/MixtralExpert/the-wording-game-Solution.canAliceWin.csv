NO.

The function get\_response() is not vulnerable to CWE-918 because it checks for private addresses using the is\_private\_address() function and raises an exception if the URL is a private address. This prevents the function from making requests to unintended or unauthorized hosts or ports. Therefore, the function is not vulnerable to SSRF attacks.

The canAliceWin() function is unrelated to the get\_response() function and is not vulnerable to CWE-918. It is a function that checks whether Alice can win a game based on the words in lists a and b.",1729,136,14.548960208892822

The given code does not contain any authorization or access control checks, so it cannot be vulnerable to CWE-863, which specifically deals with incorrect authorization checks. The code defines a class method `canAliceWin` that performs a certain calculation based on input lists `a` and `b`, but it does not check whether the current user is allowed to access or modify the data contained in those lists. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-863.

However, it is important to note that the absence of authorization checks in the code does not mean that the overall system is secure.

The `send_transaction` function simply calls another function `send_transactions` with the provided arguments, so any vulnerabilities in this function would depend on the implementation of `send_transactions`.

To clarify, CWE-863 is a vulnerability type that occurs when a product performs an authorization check but does not correctly perform the check, allowing attackers to bypass intended access restrictions. The provided `send_transaction` function does not contain any authorization checks, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-863.
