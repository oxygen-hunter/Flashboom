Explanation:

The vulnerability in the first code snippet is related to the CWE-264 weakness, which is about the improper management of authorization features. More specifically, the vulnerability is about the lack of token expiration, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions.

The second code snippet is almost identical to the first one, and it also lacks token expiration. Therefore, it is also vulnerable to the same type of attack. An attacker who has a valid token could use it indefinitely, even if the user associated with the token is disabled or the password is changed.
