The function `create_transaction()` does not appear to contain any logic that would produce different observable behavior based on secret or security-relevant data. It simply creates a `Transaction` object based on the provided parameters.

The `findPeakGrid()` function is a separate function that operates on a matrix of integers and returns the coordinates of the peak element in the matrix. This function does not contain any security vulnerabilities related to CWE-203 as it does not handle any sensitive data or produce different behavior based on secret information.",1460,120,12.275612831115723

The function `findPeakGrid` is not vulnerable to CWE-203 as it does not expose any information about the internal state or behavior of the function to unauthorized actors. It is a pure function that takes a 2D list as input and returns a list as output based on the maximum value in the list. The function does not contain any conditional statements that expose different behavior based on the input, and therefore, it is not vulnerable to the discrepancies described in the CWE-203 description.",1702,114,11.353213787078857

The function _hkey(s) only performs string manipulation by converting the first letter of the string to uppercase and replacing underscores with hyphens. It does not use CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, nor does it neutralize or incorrectly neutralize CRLF sequences from inputs.

The code you provided is not vulnerable to CWE-93 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')). This code is dealing with lists and integers, and there is no usage of CRLF sequences or any type of user-supplied input that could introduce such a vulnerability. The vulnerability in the first code snippet exists because it does not properly neutralize CRLF sequences in user-supplied input when constructing HTTP responses, which is not a concern in the second code snippet.",659,121,14.397110939025879

The code you provided is not vulnerable to CWE-93 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')). This code does not use CRLF sequences in any way, so there is no possibility of it being improperly neutralized.

The function replace is not vulnerable to CWE-93 because it does not use CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, and it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralize CRLF sequences from inputs. The function replace is only adding a key-value pair to a dictionary, and it does not process any special characters in a way that would make it vulnerable to CRLF injection attacks.

The function findPeakGrid, on the other hand, does not handle any user input, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-93 either. It takes a 2D list of integers as input and returns the coordinates of the peak element in the list.

The function _delete\_user(content) is not vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as per the CWE-918 description provided. This function is responsible for deleting a user from the system given a content object, and it does not make any external HTTP requests based on user-supplied input that could be manipulated to perform SSRF attacks.

The findPeakGrid function is unrelated to the _delete\_user function and is not involved in any way that could introduce a vulnerability to the code. It is a utility function to find the peak grid in a 2D matrix, and it does not make any external requests or handle user input.",2006,150,17.616041898727417
76,CWE-284," Yes, the code is vulnerable according to CWE-284: Incorrect Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal').

The reason is that the code does not check the input 'content' for any potential path traversal patterns, such as '../' or '/' in user-supplied input, which could allow an attacker to delete files outside of the intended directory.

For example, an attacker could potentially supply a 'content' object with a manipulated 'id' field that contains a path traversal pattern, allowing them to delete arbitrary files on the system.

Therefore, it is important to validate and sanitize user input to prevent any potential path traversal attacks.",2148,156,15.575080633163452

The function `get_file` is vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CWE-918, because it makes an HTTP request to a user-supplied URL without proper validation. However, the `findPeakGrid` function does not make any network requests or perform any operations that would be vulnerable to SSRF. It is a function that operates on a 2D matrix of integers and returns the coordinates of the peak element in the matrix. Therefore, it is not vulnerable.",847,115,13.77982234954834

The function `authenticate` does not show any vulnerability related to CWE-264, which is about insecure permission and privilege management. This function seems to handle authentication and authorization correctly, by checking if a user is disabled or not, and if a user has access to the given tenant.

The `findPeakGrid` function is unrelated to the `authenticate` function and is not vulnerable to CWE-264 either, as it is only performing calculations on a matrix of integers.",3364,116,12.076855659484863

The provided code is not vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal) because it does not construct a pathname using external input. It only uses the `doc` parameter to retrieve a boilerplate file, but there is no evidence that this file path is constructed using user-supplied input or that it involves path traversal. The vulnerability in the initial code is due to the use of `exec()` with untrusted code, which is unrelated to CWE-22.",772,111,13.289884567260742
