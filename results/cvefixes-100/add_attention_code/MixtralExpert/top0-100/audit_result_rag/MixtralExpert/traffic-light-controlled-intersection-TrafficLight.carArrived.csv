The `set_bookmark` function does not appear to contain any code that makes a request to an external URL based on user input, so it is not vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The function simply modifies the bookmark data based on the provided `book_id`, `book_format`, and `bookmark_key` input.

On the other hand, the `carArrived` function is not vulnerable to SSRF either, but for a different reason. The function takes in `roadId`, `carId`, `direction`, `turnGreen`, and `crossCar` as input, but it does not make any external requests based on this input.
