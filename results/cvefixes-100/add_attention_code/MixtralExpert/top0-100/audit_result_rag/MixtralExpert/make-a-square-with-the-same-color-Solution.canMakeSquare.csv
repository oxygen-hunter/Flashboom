This could lead to an unauthorized deletion of sensitive data or even a complete system compromise.

However, the code you provided is actually for deleting a user in a database, not for file operations, so it is not vulnerable to path traversal attacks.

The `filename` is not directly concatenated with the directory path, so special elements such as "".."" and ""/"" separators cannot be used to escape the restricted directory.
