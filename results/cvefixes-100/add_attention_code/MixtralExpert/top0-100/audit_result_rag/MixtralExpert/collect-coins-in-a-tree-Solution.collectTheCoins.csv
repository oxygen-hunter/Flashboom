The function `show_book(book_id)` is not vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) because it does not make any external HTTP requests based on user-supplied input.

This function only processes transactions and updates the payment object's state accordingly, without exposing any information that could be used by an unauthorized actor to infer the state of the product.

As for the `collectTheCoins` function, it is a separate function that deals with a completely different problem, and it does not seem to be vulnerable to CWE-203 either. It is a function that calculates the maximum number of coins that can be collected in a graph, where coins are represented as nodes and edges represent possible movements between nodes. The function uses a set of adjacency lists to represent the graph and performs a series of operations to calculate the maximum number of coins that can be collected.

The function _delete\_user(content) is not vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not make any external HTTP requests based on user input. It performs a series of database operations to delete a user and related data based on the content object.

76,CWE-284," NO.

The function _delete\_user is not vulnerable to CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) because it checks if the user to be deleted has the name ""Guest"" before proceeding with the deletion. If the user is the ""Guest"" user, the function raises an exception and does not proceed with the deletion. This ensures that the ""Guest"" user, which is likely a default or built-in user with limited privileges, cannot be deleted by an attacker.

Additionally, the function checks if there is at least one remaining admin user before proceeding with the deletion. This ensures that there is always at least one admin user in the system, which is an important security measure.

Therefore, the function is not vulnerable to CWE-284.

The collectTheCoins function is not related to the _delete\_user function and is not vulnerable to CWE-284. It is a function for finding the number of coins that can be collected in a graph, and it does not involve any access control or authentication checks.",2200,235,25.847750425338745

The function `get_file` is indeed vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CWE-918, because it makes an HTTP request to the URL provided in the `recipe.link` attribute without proper validation. This can allow an attacker to craft a `recipe` object with a localhost URL and read sensitive information from the internal file system.

However, the `collectTheCoins` function is not related to network requests or URLs, it only performs a graph traversal algorithm on a given adjacency list. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to SSRF or any other web-based vulnerabilities.",899,145,16.31479287147522

Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-116.

The `collectTheCoins` function is not related to the `prepare_plugin_docs_command` function and is not vulnerable to CWE-116 either.
