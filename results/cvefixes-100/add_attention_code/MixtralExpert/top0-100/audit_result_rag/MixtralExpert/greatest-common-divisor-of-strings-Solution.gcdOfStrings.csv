The `gcdOfStrings` function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the lengths of two input strings `str1` and `str2` and returns the common substring of length GCD. It does not contain any authorization checks, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-863. However, it does have a bug in the `check` function. The `check` function checks if the input string `s` is a multiple of the common substring `common`, but it does not handle the case where the length of `s` is not a multiple of the length of `common`. In this case, the function will return `False`, even if `s` contains the correct common substring.

On the other hand, the `gcdOfStrings` function is unrelated to the `gateway_postprocess` function and is not vulnerable to CWE-203 either. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two strings by finding the GCD of their lengths and checking if the strings share a common substring of that length. If they do, that substring is returned as the result. If not, an empty string is returned.

The given code is not vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or any other vulnerabilities mentioned in the CVE or CWE descriptions. This is because the code does not dynamically generate a web page that contains user-controllable input. Instead, it is a unit test function that checks the behavior of Django's `is_safe_url` function, which was vulnerable to XSS in the past. The function tests whether certain URLs are allowed or blocked based on their scheme, and it uses Django's test client to simulate HTTP requests. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to XSS or any other web application vulnerabilities.

The second code snippet you provided is a function that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two strings `str1` and `str2`. It first calculates the GCD of their lengths, and then checks if there is a common substring of that length that appears at the beginning of both strings. If so, it returns that substring.

However, it does not check if the user invoking the function is an admin user or has the necessary permissions to delete other users.
