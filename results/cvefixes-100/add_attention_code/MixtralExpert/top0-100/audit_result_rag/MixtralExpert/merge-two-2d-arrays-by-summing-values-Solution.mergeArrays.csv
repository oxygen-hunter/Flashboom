The function mergeArrays is not vulnerable to CWE-863 as it does not perform any authorization checks. This vulnerability type is related to incorrect authorization checks, but the provided function does not contain any checks to bypass. Therefore, it is not vulnerable.

However, the provided send_transactions function could be vulnerable to CWE-863 if the account object's get_nonce method, __execute__ method, or any other involved methods have improper authorization checks.

The `filter` function removes entries from a dictionary based on a list of keys, and the `mergeArrays` function merges two sorted lists of pairs of integers into a single sorted list of pairs of integers.

76,CWE-284," The answer is YES, the function _delete\_user(content) is vulnerable to CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). The vulnerability exists because the function does not check if the user invoking the function has the necessary permissions to delete another user. It only checks if the user to be deleted is not the ""Guest"" user and if there is at least one admin user remaining. This means that any user with the ability to call this function can delete any other user, as long as they are not the ""Guest"" user.
