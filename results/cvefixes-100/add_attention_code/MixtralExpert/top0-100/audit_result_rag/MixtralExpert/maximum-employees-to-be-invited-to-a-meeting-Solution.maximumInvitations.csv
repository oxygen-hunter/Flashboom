The given code has no network-related functionality, so it cannot be vulnerable to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability, which is a type of vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate the server into making requests to internal resources. The code is only performing local operations based on the input, and there is no way for an attacker to control or manipulate the destination of any requests.",874,90,9.012752056121826
63,CWE-863," NO.

The given code does not contain the same vulnerability as the first code snippet. The first code snippet is vulnerable because it uses the private key directly in the function, which can lead to authorization check errors. However, the second code snippet does not use the private key or any authorization checks, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-863.

However, I would like to point out that the `maximumInvitations` method assumes that the `favorite` parameter is a list of integers that represent a directed graph with a cycle. If the `favorite` parameter does not meet this assumption, then the method may not work as intended. It is important to ensure that the input to this method meets the necessary assumptions before using it.",933,164,17.007802724838257
64,CWE-863," NO.

The provided Python code is not vulnerable to CWE-863 as it does not perform any authorization checks. It is a graph traversal algorithm that calculates the maximum number of invitations based on a list of favorites. The vulnerability in the previous code was due to improper authorization checks, but this code does not perform any checks, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-863.",981,90,8.837336778640747

The code you provided is not vulnerable to CWE-93 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')) because it does not use CRLF sequences in a way that could be exploited. It is safe from this type of vulnerability.

The original code snippet was vulnerable because it used CRLF sequences in the context of HTTP headers, which could be exploited to inject additional headers or modify the behavior of the application.

The function _delete\_user(content) is not vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not make any external requests based on user input. It performs database operations to delete a user and related data based on the content object. The vulnerability you mentioned earlier, CVE-2022-0339, is related to SSRF in Pypi calibreweb, but this code snippet is not related to that vulnerability.",2098,106,11.567811012268066

The function _delete\_user() checks if the user to be deleted is not the ""Guest"" user and if there is at least one remaining admin user. Only if both conditions are met, the function proceeds to delete the user and related records. This ensures that a user with the special role ""Guest"" cannot be deleted and that there is always at least one admin user remaining. Therefore, the function is not vulnerable to CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).

The second function maximumInvitations() is unrelated to the first function and does not contain any access control mechanisms, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-284.",2240,144,16.426608562469482
