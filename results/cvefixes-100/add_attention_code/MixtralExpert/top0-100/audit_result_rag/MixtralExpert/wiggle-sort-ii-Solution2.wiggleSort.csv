The function `get_response` is not vulnerable to CWE-918 because it includes a check to prevent querying private addresses. The `is_private_address` function is called with the `url` parameter, and if it returns `True`, the function raises an exception and does not proceed with the request. This means that the function will not make requests to arbitrary URLs provided by an attacker, and therefore is not vulnerable to SSRF attacks.

On the other hand, the `wiggleSort` function is not related to network requests, and it does not use the `get_response` function or any similar functionality. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-918 or any other network-related vulnerabilities.",2073,162,17.882302284240723

The code you provided is not vulnerable to CWE-918 because it does not make any network requests based on user-supplied input. The `is_private_address` function takes a URL as input, performs a DNS lookup to get the IP address of the hostname, and then checks if the IP address is a private address. It does not make any requests to the URL or the IP address, so there is no risk of SSRF or any other type of network attack.

The `wiggleSort` function is also not vulnerable because it only performs in-memory sorting operations on a list of integers. It does not make any network requests or access any external resources.

In general, to determine if a piece of code is vulnerable to CWE-918, you should look for any functions or methods that make network requests based on user-supplied input.

Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for an infinite loop vulnerability.

The other functions `wiggleSort`, `nth_element`, and `reversedTriPartitionWithVI` are also not directly related to the `data_received` function and do not contain any obvious infinite loop vulnerabilities based on the provided code.
