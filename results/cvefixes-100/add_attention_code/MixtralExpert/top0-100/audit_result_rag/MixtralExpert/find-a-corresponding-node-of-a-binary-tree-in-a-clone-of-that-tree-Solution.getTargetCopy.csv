73,CWE-93," NO.

The function replace() is similar to the one given in the vulnerable code, but it is not vulnerable because it does not use CRLF sequences as a special element or in a way that would make it vulnerable to CWE-93. The function getTargetCopy() does not use the replace() function or any other vulnerable function, so it is also not vulnerable.",554,80,8.435211181640625
74,CWE-79," NO.

The function test_security_check is not vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it is not directly dealing with user input that is reflected back to the user without proper sanitization. It is performing security checks on URLs and checking if they are present in the response.

However, the provided code snippet does not include the full context of where the function is used, so it's important to ensure that the function is not used in a way that would make it vulnerable to XSS attacks.",2474,113,12.523469686508179

76,CWE-284," Yes, the code is vulnerable according to CWE-284: Improper Access Control. The vulnerability is due to the lack of access control checks on the deletion of the user. The code checks if the user to be deleted is not the ""Guest"" user, but it does not check if the user performing the deletion has the necessary privileges to do so. Therefore, any user, including those who are not administrators, can delete any other user as long as they know the user's ID. To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to add an access control check to ensure that only administrators can delete users.",2049,134,14.62414836883545

The function `get_file` is not vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it doesn't make a request to a user-supplied URL or any external URL. It only makes a request to the Dropbox URL which is generated by the `Dropbox.get_share_link()` function. Therefore, it doesn't meet the criteria for CWE-918.

On the other hand, the `getTargetCopy` function is completely unrelated to the `get_file` function and it doesn't make any network requests, so it's not vulnerable to SSRF either.",748,138,14.01928973197937
78,CWE-116," NO, this code is not vulnerable to CWE-116. The vulnerability in the first code snippet was due to improper escaping of shell commands, but this code does not contain any shell commands or command injection vulnerabilities.

Yes, the code is vulnerable.

The `load` function is vulnerable to CWE-78 (OS Command Injection) as it uses `exec` to execute a string constructed from an externally-influenced input (`code`) without properly neutralizing special elements. An attacker can craft the `doc` input in such a way that it leads to the execution of arbitrary OS commands.

However, the `getTargetCopy` function is not vulnerable as it does not involve any OS command injection. It only performs a tree traversal and comparison, which doesn't involve external inputs or OS commands.",1041,134,13.693838357925415

86,CWE-835," NO.

The function `data_received` is not vulnerable to CWE-835 because the loop has an exit condition that depends on the length of `buf`, which is updated within the loop based on the size of the header and the available data in the buffer. Therefore, the loop can be exited if the buffer does not contain enough data to form a complete message.

The `getTargetCopy` function is not related to the `data_received` function and is not vulnerable to CWE-835 as it does not contain any loops.",910,122,13.124663591384888
87,CWE-444," NO.

The code you provided is not vulnerable to CWE-444. The reason is that it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent, but rather it processes video metadata and constructs a new URL with a specified HTTP header. The potential vulnerability in the original code comes from the `smuggle_url` function, which might allow arbitrary HTTP headers to be added to a request, but in this code, it only specifies a fixed `Referer` header.",1699,105,11.363703966140747

89,CWE-22," NO.

The function `backup_download` is not vulnerable to CWE-22 because it does not construct a pathname using external input. The `filename` variable is used in `os.path.join` which is a safe operation as it does not allow path traversal. The `settings.backup.folder` is a constant folder path and not user-supplied input. Therefore, it is not possible to escape the restricted directory using special elements in the filename.

On the other hand, the `getTargetCopy` function is not related to file operations and does not use user-supplied input to construct a pathname, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-22.",722,148,14.070763349533081
90,CWE-22," NO.

The function `backup_download(filename)` is not vulnerable to CWE-22 because it uses the `os.path.join()` function to construct the file path, which helps prevent relative and absolute path traversal attacks. The `os.path.join()` function combines the elements in a platform-specific manner, and it does not include the special elements such as "".."" or ""/"" in the resulting path.

However, the `getTargetCopy()` function is not directly related to the file handling operation, and it does not seem to be vulnerable to CWE-22 based on the provided code.",715,138,14.060982704162598

92,CWE-22," Yes, the provided code is vulnerable to CWE-22. The vulnerability exists due to the use of user-supplied input `filename` in the `send_file` function without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker can manipulate the `filename` to traverse the file system and access files outside of the intended restricted directory. This is demonstrated in the original code where `filename` is used in `os.path.join` which can lead to path traversal attacks.

In the provided code, the `getTargetCopy` function does not directly use the user-supplied input `filename`, but it is still vulnerable because the `swaggerui_static` function with the same vulnerability is called before this function. If an attacker can manipulate the input to the `swaggerui_static` function, they can potentially access or modify files outside of the intended directory.",768,190,19.465713024139404
93,CWE-22," NO.

The function swaggerui\_static is vulnerable to a path traversal attack (CWE-22) because it uses the user-controlled filename variable to construct the path of the file to be sent, without properly validating or neutralizing the input. This can allow an attacker to access files outside of the intended restricted directory.

However, the function getTargetCopy is not vulnerable to path traversal attacks because it does not construct file paths using user-controlled input. Instead, it performs a tree traversal on two pre-defined tree structures (original and cloned) and returns the corresponding node in the cloned tree for a given target node in the original tree.

The code you provided does not appear to be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, which is what CWE-79 refers to. This is because it does not involve generating any web page that contains user-controllable input. Instead, it is performing some unit tests on a queryset of Location objects.

However, the first code snippet you provided is vulnerable to XSS attacks because it uses the `mark_safe()` function incorrectly, which allows user-controllable input to be rendered as HTML without proper sanitization. This can lead to the execution of malicious JavaScript code in the user's browser. To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should use the `format_html()` function instead, which provides better protection against XSS attacks.",2349,172,17.979252815246582
