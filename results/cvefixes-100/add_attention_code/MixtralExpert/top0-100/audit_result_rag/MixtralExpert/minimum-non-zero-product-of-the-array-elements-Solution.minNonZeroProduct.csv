71,CWE-93," No, this code is not vulnerable to CWE-93. The vulnerability in the first code snippet exists because it does not properly neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs, leading to a CRLF attack. However, the second code snippet does not handle user input or perform any operations that could be vulnerable to CRLF attacks.
