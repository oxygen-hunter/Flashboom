Specifically, the `_delete_user` function deletes a user if the current user has the admin role. However, there are no checks to ensure that the current user is authorized to delete the specified user. This could allow an attacker to delete any user, not just their own, if they are able to gain access to an admin account.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should add checks to ensure that the current user is authorized to delete the specified user.
