The function `get_response` is not vulnerable to CWE-918 because it includes a check to prevent querying private addresses. The `is_private_address` function is called with the `url` parameter before making the request, and if it returns `True`, the function raises an exception and does not make the request. This prevents the function from making requests to private addresses, which is the vulnerability described in the CWE-918 description.

Additionally, the `send_file()` function, which is used to send the file to the user, does not take any path information as input, only the file object.

The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to path traversal attacks, unlike the previous code you provided.

The path is being built by joining together a series of hard-coded directory names with the `filename` variable. Since there are no special elements (such as "".."" or ""/"") being incorporated into the path from user input, there is no way for an attacker to escape the intended directory and access arbitrary files on the system.

The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to path traversal attacks, unlike the previous code snippet. In this code, the `swaggerui_static` function constructs a file path using `os.path.join` in a manner that does not involve concatenating user-supplied input directly onto the path string. Instead, the user-supplied input (`filename`) is passed as the final argument to `os.path.join`, which ensures that the filename is treated as a separate path component and is not combined with the rest of the path using string concatenation.

Therefore, even if an attacker attempts to supply a filename containing special characters such as `..` or `/`, the resulting path will still be constructed within the intended directory and will not escape the restricted parent directory.
