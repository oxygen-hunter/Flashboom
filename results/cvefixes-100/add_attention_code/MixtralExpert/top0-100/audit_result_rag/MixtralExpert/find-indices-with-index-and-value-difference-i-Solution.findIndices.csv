This means that an attacker can potentially delete any user object in the system if they can successfully impersonate an admin user.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should add an additional check to ensure that the user making the request is the same as the user being deleted. For example, you can add a check to see if the user making the request is the same as the user object being deleted:
```python
