The `unhappyFriends` function contains conditional statements and data dependencies, but they do not appear to be vulnerable to the issue described in CWE-203. The function compares the indices of the `friends` matrix and the `pairing` list, but these values are determined solely by the input arguments and the internal logic of the function, and do not depend on any external state or secret information.

76,CWE-284," Yes, the code is vulnerable according to CWE-284: Improper Access Control. The vulnerability exists because the code does not check effectively if the user invoking the function is an admin user or not. It only checks if the user is not the ""Guest"" user, but that is not enough to ensure that the user is an admin user. An attacker could potentially exploit this by manipulating the user ID passed to the function to delete any user, even if they are not an admin. This could lead to unauthorized deletion of user accounts, which is a form of access control violation described by CWE-284.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add a proper check to ensure that the user invoking the function is an admin user. You could do this by querying the user's role and checking if it has the necessary admin privileges before proceeding with the deletion process.",2111,195,22.087551832199097
