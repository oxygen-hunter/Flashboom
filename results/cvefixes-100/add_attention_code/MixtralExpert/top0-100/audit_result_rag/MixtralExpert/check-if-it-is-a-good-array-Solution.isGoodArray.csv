The code is vulnerable to XSS attacks (CWE-79) due to the following reasons:

1. It does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

3. An attacker can exploit this by providing a malicious URL containing JavaScript code, which will be executed in the victim's browser when the generated web page is accessed.

For example, an attacker can provide a URL like `http://example.com?<script>malicious_code</script>`, which will pass the security check and be included in the generated web page. When the victim accesses the page, the malicious code will be executed in their browser.

The provided `isGoodArray` function is not directly related to the vulnerability, but it is also vulnerable to the same issue. It constructs a string using user-supplied input (`nums`) without proper sanitization, which can lead to XSS attacks.",2424,275,27.57683777809143
