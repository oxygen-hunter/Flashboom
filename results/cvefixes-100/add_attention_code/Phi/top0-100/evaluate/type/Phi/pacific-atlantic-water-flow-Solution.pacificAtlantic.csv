[{'lang': 'en', 'value': ""Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database.

The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery) as described. The code is a Python function that updates a user's profile information based on form data. It does not involve any server-side request handling or external resource fetching that could be manipulated by an attacker to forge requests.

The CWE-918 vulnerability typically involves a web application that accepts URLs or other input from an upstream component and uses it to make requests to external services or resources without proper validation or sanitization. This can allow an attacker to craft malicious input that causes the server to make requests to unintended destinations, potentially leading to information disclosure, unautrighted access, or other security issues.

In the provided code, there is no evidence of such behavior. The function processes form data, updates the user's profile, and handles database operations. There is no interaction with external services or resources based on user input that could lead to a server-side request forgery vulnerability.

Therefore, based on the provided code snippet, it is not vulnerable to CWE-918.","

The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-ID CVE-2022-0939 or the CWE-ID CWE-918 as described. The code is a login function that checks for LDAP authentication and handles user login with password verification. The potential vulnerability described in the CWE-ID CWE-918 involves the web server sending requests to unintended destinations, which could be exploited by attackers. However, the code does not contain any functionality that would allow an attacker to manipulate the destination of requests made by the server.

The code does not include any functionality for the server to send requests to external URLs or services based on user input or other untrusted sources. The login function only processes the provided username and password for authentication purposes and does not interact with any external services or resources based on user input.

Therefore, based on the provided code snippet, it does not appear to be vulnerable to the described Server-Side Request Forging (SSRF) vulnerability. However, it is essential to review the entire application and its interactions with external services to ensure there are no other potential vulnerabilities.","

The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

43,CWE-918," YES, the code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if the `calibre_db.fill_indexpage` function or any other function it calls does not properly validate or sanitize the input it receives. If the `data` parameter is used to construct a URL or a request to an external service without proper validation, an attacker could manipulate the `data` parameter to cause the server to make requests to unintended destinations.

For example, if the `calibre_db.fill_indexpage` function or any other function it calls uses the `data` parameter to make a network request, and the `data` parameter is directly used in the construction of the request without proper validation, an attacker could pass a malicious string that alters the intended destination of the request.

To mitright the vulnerability, you should ensure that any external requests made by the server are only to trusted destinations and that user input is properly validated and sanitized before being used in such requests. Additionally, implementing proper access controls and using secure coding practices can help mitigate the risk of SSRF attacks.","

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `test_security_check` function handles the `bad_url` and `good_url` parameters when constructing the `nasty_url` and `safe_url`. The `urlquote` function is used to URL-encode the `bad_url` and `good_url`, but it does not sanitize or escape the input in a way that prevents XSS.

In the `test_security_check` function, the `bad_url` and `good_url` parameters are being passed directly into the URL without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially manipulate these parameters to inject malicious scripts into the URL, which could then be executed by the victim's browser when the URL is accessed.

To fix this vulnerability, the `test_security_check` function should validate and sanitize the `bad_url` and `good_url` parameters before using them in the URL construction. This could involve using a whitelist approach to only allow certain characters or patterns in the URLs, or using a more robust sanitization library to ensure that any potentially harmful content is properly escaped or removed.

Additionally, the `urlquote` function should be reviewed to ensure that it is properly escaping all potentially dangerous characters","

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

                  Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.
                  Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a type of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles the `recipe.link` URL. An attacker could manipulate the `recipe.link` to point to an internal or unexpected host, potentially allowing them to access sensitive information or bypass access controls.

In the `get_file` function, the code replaces 'www.dropbox.' with 'dl.dropboxusercontent.' in the `recipe.link` URL before making the request. This replacement is hardcoded and does not validate or sanitize the input URL. An attacker could exploit this by providing a malicious URL that redirects the server to an internal or sensitive resource.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the `recipe.link` URL before making the request.

Extended description:

            Improper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.

These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, ""GET /index.html HTTP/1.1"" is a structured message containing a command (""GET"") with a single argument (""/index.html"") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (""HTTP/1.1"").
            If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

The provided Python code is vulnerable to CWE-78, which is Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (Injection). The vulnerability arises from the use of the `exec()` function, which executes the code it is given. If the `code` variable contains malicious input, it could lead to arbitrary command execution.

In the `load()` function, the `code` variable is assigned a value from `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`. If this function retrieves code from an untrusted source and that code is not properly sanitized or validated before being executed with `exec()`, it could contain malicious commands that would be executed on the system.

The `exec()` function is particularly dangerous because it can execute any valid Python code, which could include system calls or other operations that could compromise the security of the system. This is why it is considered a best practice to avoid using `exec()` with untrusted input.

In summary, the vulnerability in the provided code is due to the use of `exec()` with potentially untrusted input, which could lead to arbitrary command execution.","

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

The provided code is vulnerable due to the use of the `exec` function, which executes the code retrieved from an external source without any validation or sanitization. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if an attacker is able to control the content of the ""bs-extensions"" file. This is a classic example of a code injection vulnerability, which is categorized under CWE-22 (Cross-site Scripting (XSS)).

In the context of the CWE-22 description, the vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the ""bs-extensions"" file, which is then executed by the `exec` function. This can lead to various security issues, such as data leakage, unautrighted file access, or even remote code execution, depending on the nature of the injected code and the environment in which the code is running.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

95,CWE-79," YES

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-controlled input in the `test_custom_field_table_render` function. The `LocationTable` class is likely rendering HTML content based on the `custom_column_expected` dictionary values, which contain HTML tags and attributes. If the `LocationTable` class does not properly sanitize or escape this user-controlled input before rendering it to the web page, it could lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

For example, the `url_field` value contains an HTML anchor tag with an `href` attribute. If the `LocationTable` class directly inserts this value into the HTML without proper escaping, an attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into the `url_field` value, which would then be executed by the web browser when the page is rendered.

To fix this vulnerability, the `LocationTable` class should ensure that all user-controlled input is properly sanitized and escaped before being rendered to the web page. This can be achieved by using Django's built-in template system, which automatically escapes variables by default, or by using the `escape` function from the `django.utils.html` module to manually escape the input.","

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.
