The provided Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server Side Request Forgery) as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2021-43780. The code snippet is a simple function that makes an HTTP request to a given URL and handles the response. It does not involve any URL processing or handling that would allow an attacker to manipulate the destination of the request. The vulnerability described in CVE-2021-43780 is specific to Redash and involves the handling of URL-loading data sources, which is not present in the provided code.","

[{'lang': 'en', 'value': ""Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly.

An http parameter may contain a URL value and could cause the web application to redirect the request to the specified URL. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts have a more trustworthy appearance.

The provided code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in CVE-2022-0939. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not sufficiently ensure that the request to retrieve the contents of a URL is being sent to the expected destination. This can be exploited by providing URLs to unexpected hosts or ports, potentially bypassing access controls such as firewalls.

In the code, the vulnerability can be found in the following lines:

```python
ip_Address = request.headers.get('X-Forwarded-For', request.remote_addr)
log.warning('LDAP Login failed for user ""%s"" IP-address: %s', form['username'], ip_Address)
flash(_(u""Wrong Username or Password""), category=""error"")
```

Here, the IP address of the client is being logged and used in the flash message. An attacker can manipulate the 'X-Forwarded-For' header to spoof the IP address, leading to potential SSRF attacks.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the input before using it in the request. Additionally, the code should ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination and not to an arbitrary or unexpected host or port.","

The provided code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2022-0990. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not sufficiently ensure that the request to retrieve the contents of a URL is being sent to the expected destination. This can be exploited by providing URLs to unexpected hosts or ports, potentially bypassing access controls such as firewalls.

In the code, the LDAP authentication is performed using the services.ldap.bind_user() function, which takes the username and password as input. If an attacker can manipulate the username and password fields in the form submission, they can potentially make it appear that the server is sending the request to an unintended destination.

For example, an attacker could craft a username and password combination that points to a malicious LDAP server, causing the server to send the request to that server instead of the intended destination. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or other security breaches.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should implement proper input validation and sanitization to ensure that the URLs and other user inputs are being sent to the expected destinations. Additionally, the code should implement proper access controls and network security measures to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.","

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not validate or sanitize the input for the `data` parameter, which is used to determine the type of books to render. If an attacker can manipulate the `data` parameter to point to an unexpected or malicious URL, the server might attempt to retrieve content from that URL, potentially bypassing access controls and exposing sensitive information or allowing the attacker to use the server as a proxy for their own malicious activities.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the `data` parameter against a whitelist of allowed values before using it to determine the type of books to render. Additionally, the code should ensure that any URLs or external resources are accessed securely and with proper validation to prevent SSRP attacks.","

The provided code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CWE-ID CWE-918. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not validate or sanitize the input for the `order` parameter. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `order` parameter to include a malicious URL or command that the server would then execute or retrieve, leading to unauthorized access or data leakage.

In the code snippet, the `order` parameter is used to determine the sorting of the books. If an attacker can control the `order` parameter, they might be able to inject a URL or command that the server will process. For example, if the `order` parameter is used in a database query without proper validation, an attacker could inject a SQL query that the server would execute, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the `order` parameter to ensure that it only contains valid sorting options and does not include any malicious input. Additionally, using prepared statements or parameterized queries can help prevent SQL injection attacks.","

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code retrieves the contents of a URL or similar request from an upstream component without sufficiently ensuring that the request is being sent to the expected destination. In this case, the vulnerability is present in the `calibre_db.fill_indexpage` function, which is called with the `db_filter` parameter.

The `db_filter` is constructed using the `config.config_read_column` value, which is obtained from the `config` object. If an attacker can manipulate the `config.config_read_column` value, they can potentially make the server retrieve content from an unexpected host or port.

For example, an attacker could set `config.config_read_column` to a malicious URL or a URL that points to a sensitive internal resource. When the `calibre_db.fill_indexpage` function is called, the server would retrieve the content from the malicious URL or internal resource, potentially bypassing access controls such as firewalls.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate the `config.config_read_column` value and ensure that it only contains valid column names for the `db.cc_classes","

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-918, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not validate or sanitize the URLs or requests it retrieves from the database before using them. If an attacker can manipulate the database entries to include malicious URLs or requests, the server could be tricked into making requests to unintended destinations, potentially bypassing access controls and exposing sensitive information or allowing unauthorized actions.

For example, if an attacker can insert a URL into the database that points to an internal service or resource, the server might retrieve and process that request, leading to information disclosure or other security breaches.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize any URLs or requests it retrieves from the database before using them. This can be done by implementing strict whitelisting of allowed domains, using allowlists for URLs, or by ensuring that the retrieved URLs are within the expected scope of the application. Additionally, using a proxy or a dedicated service to handle external requests can help isolate the server from direct exposure to potentially malicious requests.","

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, specifically Type 1 (Reflected XSS). The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles user-controlled input (in this case, the `bad_url` and `good_url` variables) and reflects it back in the HTTP response without proper sanitization or encoding.

In the `test_security_check` function, the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` variables are constructed using the `urlquote` function, which is intended to encode the user-controlled input. However, the `urlquote` function is not a standard Python function, and it's not clear if it properly encodes all necessary characters to prevent XSS attacks.

The vulnerability occurs when the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` are used in the `self.client.post` method, which sends a POST request to the server. If the `urlquote` function does not properly encode the user-controlled input, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the URL, which would then be reflected back in the HTTP response and executed by the victim's browser.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `urlquote` function properly encodes all necessary characters to prevent XSS attacks. Additionally","

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-284, Improper Access Control, because it allows the deletion of a user without proper authorization checks. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the function `_delete_user` does not verify if the current user has the necessary permissions to delete another user. It only checks if there is an admin user present in the system, but it does not check if the current user is the admin or has the appropriate permissions to perform the deletion.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add an authorization check to ensure that the current user has the necessary permissions to delete another user. This can be done by adding a check for the current user's role and comparing it with the role required for deleting a user.

Here's an example of how you can modify the code to add the authorization check:

```python
def _delete_user(content, current_user):
    if not current_user.is_admin:
        log.warning(_(u""Current user is not an admin, can't delete user""))

CWE description:
The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Extended description:

            Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:

               Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and

            When any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.
            There are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:
               
                  Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.
                  Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a type of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles the `recipe.link` URL. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `recipe.link` to point to an internal or sensitive resource on the server or even to a different server altogether.

            Improper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.
            Most products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, ""GET /index.html HTTP/1.1"" is a structured message containing a command (""GET"") with a single argument (""/index.html"") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (""HTTP/1.1"").
            If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it handles authentication tokens. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the code does not properly validate the expiration of the tokens. This can lead to a situation where an attacker can reuse an expired token to gain unauthorized access to the system.

In the code, the `authenticate` function creates a new token for the user after validating their credentials. However, it does not check if the old token is expired or not. This means that an attacker can use an expired token to authenticate themselves and gain access to the system.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check the expiration of the old token before creating a new one. This can be done by adding an expiration timestamp to the token and checking it during the authentication process. If the token is expired, the user should be prompted to create a new one.

Here's an example of how the code can be modified to fix the vulnerability:

```python
import time

def authenticate(self, context, auth):
    #... existing code...

    # Check if the old token is expired
    if 'token' in auth:
        old_token_ref = self.token_api.get_token(context=context, token_id=auth['token']['id'])

CWE description:
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `smuggle_url` function, which is not shown in the code snippet but is referenced in the `_parse_video` method. If the `smuggle_url` function does not properly sanitize or validate the input it receives, it could be exploited to perform HTTP smuggling attacks.

The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The provided `swaggerui_static` function is vulnerable to path traversal attacks (CWE-22). The function takes a `filename` parameter and constructs a file path by joining it with a predefined directory path. If an attacker can control the `filename` parameter, they could potentially include special path elements like ""../"" to traverse up the directory tree and access files outside of the intended `libs/flask_reqx/static` directory. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server.","

The provided `swaggerui_static` function is vulnerable to CWE-22, which is a path traversal vulnerability. The function takes a `filename` parameter and uses it to construct a file path by joining it with a predefined directory path. If an attacker can control the `filename` parameter, they could potentially supply a string that navigates up the directory tree (using ""../"") or directly to a system file, leading to an arbitrary file read vulnerability.

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-controlled input in the `test_custom_field_table_render` function. The `LocationTable` class is being initialized with a queryset that filters `Location` objects based on the `name` attribute, which could be user-controlled input. If the `Location` model allows for user-controlled input in the `name` field and the `LocationTable` class does not properly sanitize or escape this input when rendering the table, it could lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

For example, if the `LocationTable` class uses the `custom_column_expected` dictionary to render HTML content without proper escaping, an attacker could inject malicious scripts into the `name` field of a `Location` object. When the `LocationTable` is rendered, these scripts could be executed in the context of the web browser, leading to a successful XSS attack.

To fix this vulnerability, ensure that all user-controlled input is properly sanitized and escaped before being rendered in the web page. Use Django's built-in template system or other safe rendering methods to prevent the execution of untrusted data as HTML or JavaScript.","

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.
