The provided Python code snippet for the `get_response` function does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server Side Request Forgery) based on the information given. The vulnerability described in CWE-918 involves a web server that does not properly validate or sanitize URLs or other inputs that it uses to make outbound requests, potentially allowing an attacker to control the destination of these requests.

In the provided `get_response` function, there is no evidence of the server making outbound requests based on untrusted input. The function simply makes an HTTP request to a given URL using the `requests` library, and it does not appear to construct URLs or modify them based on external input. The function also checks if the URL is a private address and blocks it if `ENFORCE_PRIVATE_ADDRESS_BLOCK` is set to `True`.

However, without the full context of how the `requests_session` is configured and how the `is_private_address` function works, it is not possible to definitively say that the code is not vulnerable. It is important to ensure that the `requests_session` is properly configured to prevent SSRF and that the `is_private_address` function effectively blocks access to private addresses.

The `maxProfit` function provided is unrelated to the `get_response` function","

[{'lang': 'en', 'value': ""Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database.

The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-ID CVE-2022-0939 (Server-Side Request Forgery, SSRF) as described. The code is a login function that handles user authentication and does not involve processing or handling external requests that could be manipulated by an attacker to perform SSRF attacks.

The CVE-ID CVE-2022-0939 (Server-Side Request Forgery, SSRF) vulnerability typically involves a server that accepts a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL without sufficient validation, potentially allowing an attacker to make the server send requests to unintended destinations.

In the provided code, the server is not processing any external requests based on user input or other external sources. The code is focused on user authentication, handling login attempts, and redirecting users based on their authentication status. There is no evidence of the server making requests to external URLs or resources based on user input or other external factors.

Therefore, the code does not appear to be vulnerable to the SSRF vulnerability described in CVE-2022-0939.","

The provided code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CWE-ID CWE-918. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not validate or sanitize the input for the `data` parameter, which is used to determine the type of books list to render. If an attacker can manipulate the `data` parameter to point to an unexpected host or protocol, they could potentially make the server send requests to that host or protocol.

For example, if the attacker can control the `data` parameter and set it to a URL or a protocol that the server is not supposed to access, the server might send a request to that URL or protocol. This could lead to unauthorized access to internal resources or services that the server can interact with.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate the `data` parameter against a whitelist of allowed values before using it to determine the type of books list to render. Additionally, the code should not directly use the `data` parameter in any network requests without proper validation and sanitization.","

The provided code snippet for `render_downloaded_books` does not appear to be vulnerable to the CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery) as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2022-0990. The vulnerability in question involves the web server improperly handling URLs or requests, potentially allowing attackers to bypass access controls.

In the given code, there is no evidence of the web server processing or handling external URLs or requests based on user input. The function `render_downloaded_books` does not accept or process any URLs or external requests. It only queries the database for books based on the `user_id` and other parameters, and then renders a template with the results.

However, it is essential to note that without the full context of the application and how the `calibre_db.session.query` and `ub.Downloads` objects are implemented, it is impossible to definitively conclude that there are no vulnerabilities. It is always recommended to perform a thorough security review and testing to ensure the application's security.","

The provided code is vulnerable to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, as described by the CWE-ID CWE-918. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not validate or sanitize the input for the `config.config_read_column` before using it to access the database. An attacker could potentially manipulate this input to cause the server to make unauthorized requests to other servers or services.

In the code, the `config.config_read_column` is used to access a custom column in the database, which is then used to filter the results. If an attacker can control the value of `config.config_read_column`, they could potentially inject a malicious URL or command that the server would execute, leading to SSRF.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate the `config.config_read_column` against a whitelist of allowed values before using it to access the database. Additionally, the code should ensure that any URLs or commands retrieved from the database are properly sanitized and validated before being executed or used.","

The provided code is vulnerable to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, as described by the CWE-ID CWE-918. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not validate or sanitize the URLs or requests it retrieves from the database before using them. If an attacker can manipulate the database to include malicious URLs, the server could be tricked into making requests to unintended destinations, potentially bypassing security controls like firewalls.

In the code, the `calibre_db.fill_indexpage` function is called with `sort_param`, which is derived from the `order` parameter. If an attacker can control the `order` parameter, they could potentially inject a malicious URL that the server would then attempt to retrieve. This could lead to unautpta

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `urlquote` function is used to sanitize the `bad_url` and `good_url` variables before they are included in the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` strings. The `urlquote` function is intended to encode special characters in URLs to prevent them from being interpreted as control characters in HTML or JavaScript. However, the code does not properly handle the case where the `bad_url` or `good_url` contains JavaScript code or other malicious content that should not be executed.

In the test cases, the `bad_url` and `good_url` variables are set to strings that contain URLs with potentially malicious content. The `urlquote` function is used to encode these strings, but it does not guarantee that the encoded strings are safe to include in the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` strings. If the `urlquote` function does not properly encode or escape the malicious content, it could lead to XSS vulnerabilities when the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` strings are used in the `self.client.post` method.

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

CWE description:
The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Extended description:

            Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:
            
               Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)
               Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and
               Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)
            
            When any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.
            There are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:
               
                  Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.
                  Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-918, Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the way the `recipe.link` is being modified and used in the `requests.get` call. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `recipe.link` to point to an internal or sensitive resource on the server or even to a malicious server. This could lead to unautpta

The `get_file` function takes a `recipe` object as an argument, which contains a `link` attribute. If the `link` is not set, it is populated with a Dropbox share link using the `Dropbox.get_share_link(recipe)` method and then saved. The function then makes a GET request to the modified link using the `requests` library.

The vulnerability lies in the line:

Extended description:

The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

FastAPI versions lower than 0.65.2 that used cookies for authentication in path operations that received JSON payloads sent by browsers were vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack.

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-444, which is related to HTTP smuggling attacks. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `smuggle_url` function, which is not shown in the code snippet but is referenced in the `_parse_video` method. If `smuggle_url` is similar to the vulnerable `smuggle` function mentioned in the CVE description, it could allow an attacker to manipulate the HTTP headers being sent to the Vimeo server.

The `smuggle_url` function is likely used to construct an HTTP request to the Vimeo API, and if it does not properly sanitize or validate the input, an attacker could inject malicious headers or manipulate the request in a way that leads to HTTP smuggling. This could potentially allow the attacker to bypass security controls or perform actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.

To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure that any function used to construct HTTP requests properly validates and sanitizes all input, and that it does not allow for the injection of arbitrary headers or other request elements that could be used in an HTTP smuggling attack.","

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The provided Python code for the `swaggerui_static` function is vulnerable to CWE-22, which is a path traversal vulnerability. The function constructs a file path by joining the directory of the current file (`__file__`) with a series of parent directory calls (`os.path.dirname`) and then appending the `filename` parameter to it. If an attacker can control the `filename` parameter, they could potentially include special path elements like ""../"" to traverse up the directory tree and access files outside of the intended `libs/flask_restx/static` directory.

For example, if an attacker passes a filename like ""../../../../etc/passwd"", the function could potentially return the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file on a Unix-like system, which is a sensitive file containing user account information.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should sanitize the `filename` input to ensure that it does not contain any path traversal sequences before using it to construct the file path. This can be done by using secure functions that are designed to handle file paths safely, or by implementing custom checks that reject any `filename` containing suspicious characters or patterns.","

Due to incorrect usage of Django's `mark_safe()` API when rendering certain types of user-authored content; including custom links, job buttons, and computed fields; it is possible that users with permission to create or edit these types of content could craft a malicious payload (such as JavaScript code) that would be executed when rendering pages containing this content. The maintainers have fixed the incorrect uses of `mark_safe()` (generally by replacing them with appropriate use of `format_html()` instead) to prevent such malicious data from being executed. Users on Nautobot 1.6.x LTM should upgrade to v1.6.6 and users on Nautobot 2.0.x should upgrade to v2.0.5. Appropriate object permissions can and should be applied to restrict which users are permitted to create or edit the aforementioned types of user-authored content. Other than that, there is no direct workaround available.""}]

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The provided code snippet for `convert_bookformat` does not exhibit the vulnerability described by CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery). The function takes `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` as input from the request form and does not directly handle or process URLs or requests to external services based on user input. It simply converts book formats and logs the action. There is no evidence of the server retrieving content from URLs provided by users or acting as a proxy for external requests, which would be necessary for a CWE-918 vulnerability.","
