The provided Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server Side Request Forgery) as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2021-43780. The code snippet is a generic function for making HTTP requests and handling responses, and it does not involve URL processing or handling that would allow for SSRF attacks. The vulnerability described in CVE-2021-43780 is specific to Redash and its handling of URL-loading data sources, which is not present in the given code.","

These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly.

The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

Extended description:
By providing URLs to unexpected hosts or ports, attackers can make it appear that the server is sending the request, possibly bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly. The server can be used as a proxy to conduct port scanning of hosts in internal networks, use other URLs such as that can access documents on the system (using file://), or use other protocols such as gopher:// or tftp://, which may provide greater control over the contents of requests.

The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described by CWE-9EE. The code is a function that constructs a search term based on various parameters, including tags, ratings, and read status. It does not involve any network operations or handling of external requests that could be manipulated by an attacker to cause SSRF.

The code you've provided is a Python function that manipulates strings and database queries to build a search term. It does not involve any network operations or handling of external requests that could be manipulated by an attacker to cause SSRP. The function is focused on processing and formatting data for a search operation, and it does not interact with external services or resources in a way that would expose it to SSRF vulnerabilities.

However, it's important to note that without the full context of how this function is used within the application, it's not possible to definitively rule out all potential security issues. But based on the provided code snippet alone, there is no indication of SSRF vulnerability.","

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not validate or sanitize the input for the `data` parameter. An attacker can manipulate the `data` parameter to make the server retrieve content from an unexpected destination. For example, an attacker could set `data` to a malicious URL, and the server would attempt to retrieve content from that URL.

To fix this vulnerability, you should validate the `data` parameter against a whitelist of allowed values. Here's an updated version of the code with input validation:

```python
def render_books_list(data, sort_param, book_id, page):
    allowed_data = [""rated"", ""discover"", ""unread"", ""read"", ""hot"", ""download"", ""author"", ""publisher"", ""series"", ""ratings"", ""formats"", ""category"", ""language"", ""archived"", ""search"", ""advsearch""]
    if data not in allowed_data:
        return ""Invalid data parameter""

    order = get_sort_function(sort_param, data)
    if data == ""rated"":
        return render_rated_books(page, book_id, order=order)

44,CWE-918," YES, the provided code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in CWE-918.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not validate or sanitize the input received from the user before using it to make requests. In the `render_books_list` function, the `data` parameter is used to determine which type of books to render. However, there is no validation or sanitization of the `data` parameter, which could be manipulated by an attacker to make the server send requests to unintended destinations.

For example, an attacker could manipulate the `data` parameter to make the server send requests to internal network resources or other sensitive endpoints. This could potentially bypass access controls and expose sensitive information or allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the server.

To fix this vulnerability, you should validate and sanitize the `data` parameter before using it to make requests. Ensure that the `data` parameter only contains valid values that correspond to the expected types of books. Additionally, you should implement proper access controls and whitelisting of allowed destinations for any requests made by the server.","

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, specifically reflected XSS, which is a type of CWE-76 vulnerability. The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles user-controlled input (the `bad_url` and `good_url` variables) and reflects it back in the HTTP response without proper sanitization or encoding.

In the `test_security_check` function, the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` variables are constructed by concatenating user-controlled input (`bad_url` and `good_url`) with other parts of the URL. This user-controlled input is then used in the `self.client.post` method, which simulates a POST request to the server.

If the `is_safe_url` function in Django's `utils.is_safe_url` module does not properly sanitize or encode the user-controlled input before using it in the URL, it could lead to an XSS vulnerability. The CVE-2013-6040 vulnerability mentioned in the description is an example of such a vulnerability in Django's `is_safe_url` function.

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

CWE description:
The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Extended description:

            Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:

               Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and

                  Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.
                  Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-918, Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles the `recipe.link` URL. An attacker could manipulate the `recipe.link` to point to an internal or sensitive resource on the server or another server that the application has access to. Since the code does not validate or whitelist the URLs it accepts, it could be used to read sensitive files or access internal services.

In the `get_file` function, the `recipe.link` is replaced with a different domain before making the request. If an attacker can control the `recipe.url`, they could potentially replace it with a URL that points to an internal resource, and the server would attempt to retrieve the content of that resource. This could lead to unautrighted access to sensitive information.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should validate the URLs it accepts to ensure they point to expected and allowed destinations. Additionally, using a whitelist of allowed domains or implementing proper access controls can help prevent SSRF attacks.","

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it constructs the command line arguments for execution. Specifically, the issue arises from the concatenation of user-supplied input (`plugin_names`) directly into the command line without proper escaping or validation. This can lead to command injection vulnerabilities, where an attacker could supply specially crafted input to execute arbitrary commands on the host system.

In the `prepare_plugin_docs_command` function, the `plugin_names` list is joined into a single string and appended to the `cmdline_args` list, which is then used to construct the final command to be executed.

CWE description:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

Extended description:

            Improper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.
            Most products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, ""GET /index.html HTTP/1.1"" is a structured message containing a command (""GET"") with a single argument (""/index.html"") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (""HTTP/1.1"").
            If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

CWE description:
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles error messages. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the error message is directly included in the HTTP response without proper escaping or sanitization. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the error message, which can then be executed by the victim's browser when they view the error page.

In the code, the error message is passed as a parameter to the `json.dumps` function, which converts it to a JSON-formatted string. However, this does not guarantee that the error message is properly escaped or sanitized. If an attacker can control the error message, they can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed when the error page is rendered by the victim's browser.

To fix this vulnerability, the error message should be properly escaped or sanitized before being included in the HTTP response. This can be done using a library or function that is designed to handle user-controlled input and prevent XSS attacks. Additionally, the error message should be displayed in a way that does not allow it to be executed as code by the victim's browser, such as by using HTML encoding or displaying it within a text element that does not interpret the content as HTML or JavaScript.","

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The provided `swaggerui_static` function is vulnerable to CWE-22, which is an ""Improper Input Handling"" issue, specifically a path traversal vulnerability. The function takes a `filename` parameter and constructs a file path by joining it with a predefined directory path. If an attacker can control the `filename` parameter, they could potentially supply a string that navigates up the directory tree (using ""../"" sequences) and access files outside of the intended `libs/flask_reqx/static` directory.

For example, if an attacker provides a `filename` like ""../../../../etc/passwd"", the function could potentially return the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file on a Unix-like system, which is a sensitive file containing user account information.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should validate the `filename` parameter to ensure it does not contain any path traversal sequences or other unexpected characters before using it to construct a file path. Additionally, the application should consider using a whitelist approach to only allow access to specific files within the `libs/flask_reqx/static` directory.","

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-controlled input in the `custom_column_expected` dictionary. The values in this dictionary are hardcoded strings that could potentially contain malicious JavaScript code. If an attacker can manipulate the values in this dictionary, they could inject malicious scripts that would be executed when the `bound_row.get_cell(internal_col_name)` method is called.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that any user-controlled input is properly sanitized and escaped before being included in the `custom_column_expected` dictionary. Additionally, you should review the `LocationTable` and `CustomFieldColumn` classes to ensure that they properly handle user-controlled input and do not inadvertently execute any malicious scripts.","

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.
