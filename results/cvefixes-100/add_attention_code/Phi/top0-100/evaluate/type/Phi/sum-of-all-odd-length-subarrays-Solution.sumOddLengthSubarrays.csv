The provided Python code snippet does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server Side Request Forgery) as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2021-43780. The code is a simple function that makes an HTTP request to a given URL and handles the response. It does not involve any direct handling of user-supplied URLs that could be used to forge requests to unintended destinations. The vulnerability described in CVE-2021-43780 is specific to Redash and involves the use of the requests library to load data sources, which is not what the provided code is doing.

The provided code is a generic function that could be part of a larger application, and without additional context, it's not possible to determine if it's vulnerable to CWE-918. However, based on the code alone, there is no indication of vulnerability to Server Side Request Forgery as it does not involve processing or using user-supplied URLs to make requests to external services.","

These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly.

One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database.

The provided code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `search` parameter is used in the `calibre_db.get_search_results` function call. If the `search` parameter is directly included in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterized queries, an attacker could manipulate the input to alter the intended SQL command.

For example, if the `search` parameter is used in a query like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE '%' || :search || '%';
```

An attacker could provide a `search` value like `'; DROP TABLE books; --`, which would result in the following SQL command being executed:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE '%'; DROP TABLE books; --%'
```

This would cause the database to drop the `books` table, leading to data loss.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use parameterized queries or prepared statements to ensure that user input is properly sanitized and treated as data, not as part of the SQL command.","

The provided code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `sort_param` and `order` parameters are used to construct SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterized queries.

In the `if` and `elif` blocks, the code constructs SQL queries using string concatenation with the `sort_param` and `order` values directly. For example:

```python
order = [db.Tags.name.asc()] if order == ""asc"" else [db.Tags.name.desc()]
join = db.books_tags_link, db.Books.id == db.books_tags_link.c.book, db.Tags
```

If an attacker can control the `sort_param` or `order` values, they can inject malicious SQL code into the query, which can lead to unauthorized data access, data manipulation, or even complete control over the database.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use parameterized queries or prepared statements to ensure that user input is properly sanitized and treated as data, not as part of the SQL command. This can be achieved by using SQLAlchemy's built-in query API, which automatically handles parameterization and prevents SQL injection attacks.

Here's an example of how you can use parameterized queries to fix the vulnerability","

The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2022-0939. The code snippet is a login function that handles user authentication and does not involve any request handling or redirection to external URLs based on user input. It does not perform any actions that would allow an attacker to forge server-side requests or bypass access controls.

The code uses LDAP for authentication and has a fallback mechanism for password reset. It also includes error handling and logging. However, it is essential to ensure that the LDAP service and any other external services used in the code are properly secured and configured to prevent potential vulnerabilities.

To further analyze the code for potential vulnerabilities, a thorough code review and security assessment should be conducted, considering factors such as input validation, secure handling of user credentials, and proper configuration of external services.","

The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-ID CVE-2022-0990 (Server-Side Request Forgery, SSRF) or the CWE-ID CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forging). The code is a login function that handles LDAP authentication and password verification, and it does not involve any request handling or redirection that could be exploited for SSRF.

The code does not include any functionality to process external URLs or requests from upstream components, which is the primary vector for SSRF vulnerabilities. The code only deals with internal logic for user authentication and session management.

However, it is essential to note that without a complete understanding of the application's architecture and the context in which this code is used, it is not possible to definitively conclude that there are no vulnerabilities. It is always recommended to perform a thorough security review and testing to ensure the application's security.","

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `calibre_db.fill_indexpage` function, which retrieves content from URLs or similar requests. If the `sort_param` or other parameters passed to this function are controlled by an attacker, they could manipulate the function to send requests to unintended destinations.

For example, an attacker could craft a request with a malicious `sort_param` that points to an internal server or a different server altogether. If the `calibre_db.fill_indexpage` function does not properly validate and sanitize the input, it could lead to SSRF, allowing the attacker to access or manipulate internal resources.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize all user-supplied input, especially when it is used to construct URLs or requests. Additionally, the `calibre_db.fill_indexpage` function should be designed to only accept predefined, safe values for parameters like `sort_param`.","

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, specifically Type 1 (Reflected XSS). The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles user-controlled input (the `bad_url` and `good_url` variables) and reflects it back in the HTTP response without proper sanitization or encoding.

In the `test_security_check` function, the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` variables are constructed by concatenating user-controlled input (`bad_url` and `good_url`) with other parts of the URL. This user-controlled input is then used in the `self.client.post` method, which simulates a POST request to the server.

If an attacker can manipulate the `bad_url` or `good_url` variables to include malicious JavaScript code, the server may reflect this code back in the HTTP response. When a victim visits the generated URL, the malicious script will be executed in the context of the web server, potentially leading to XSS attacks.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly sanitize and encode user-controlled input before using it in the URL construction. Additionally, the server should implement proper output encoding and content security policies to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks.","

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

            There are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:
               
                  Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.
                  Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.

Extended description:

            Improper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.
            Most products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, ""GET /index.html HTTP/1.1"" is a structured message containing a command (""GET"") with a single argument (""/index.html"") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (""HTTP/1.1"").
            If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

CWE description:
A web application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site, and uses that link in a Redirect. This simplifies phishing attacks.

Extended description:
An http parameter may contain a URL value and could cause the web application to redirect the request to the specified URL. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts have a more trustworthy appearance. Whether this issue poses a vulnerability will be subject to the intended behavior of the application. For example, a search engine might intentionally provide redirects to arbitrary URLs.

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it handles authentication tokens. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the code does not properly validate the expiration of the token. This can lead to a situation where an attacker can reuse an expired token to gain unauthorized access to the system.

In the code, the `authenticate` method creates a new token for the user and tenant, but it does not check if the token is expired or not. This means that an attacker can use an expired token to authenticate and gain access to the system.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check the expiration of the token before creating a new one. This can be done by adding an expiration time to the token and checking it during the authentication process. If the token is expired, the code should return an error and not create a new token.

Here's an example of how the code can be modified to include token expiration:

```python
import time

class Token:
    def __init__(self, user_id, tenant_id, expiration_time):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.tenant_id = tenant_id
        self.expiration_time = expiration_time

CWE description:
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles the `reason` parameter when generating the error response. The `reason` parameter is directly included in the JSON response without proper escaping or sanitization. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the error message, which could be executed by the user's browser when they view the error page.

In the code snippet, the `reason` string is passed to the `json.dumps` function, which will escape some characters but not all potential XSS vectors. For example, if the `reason` parameter contains a script tag or other malicious content, it could be executed by the user's browser when they view the error page.

To fix this vulnerability, the `reason` parameter should be properly escaped or sanitized before being included in the error response. This can be done using a library or function that is specifically designed to escape or sanitize user-controlled input, such as `escape` or `html` from the `django.utils.html` module in Django.

Here's an example of how to fix the vulnerability:

```python
from django.utils.html import escape

def _get_unauth_response(self, request, reason):

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

CWE description:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

Extended description:

            Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as "".."" and ""/"" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the ""../"" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as ""/usr/local/bin"" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-controlled input in the `LocationTable` object. The `LocationTable` object likely renders HTML content based on the `custom_column_expected` dictionary values, which contain HTML tags and attributes. If the `LocationTable` object does not properly sanitize or escape this user-controlled input before rendering it to the web page, it could lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

For example, the `url_field` key in the `custom_column_expected` dictionary contains an HTML anchor tag with an `href` attribute. If the `LocationTable` object does not escape or sanitize this input before rendering it, an attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into the `href` attribute, leading to an XSS attack.

To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the `LocationTable` object properly escapes or sanitizes all user-controlled input before rendering it to the web page. This can be achieved by using a library or framework that automatically handles input sanitization and escaping, or by implementing custom sanitization and escaping functions.","

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The provided code snippet for `convert_bookformat` does not exhibit the vulnerability described by CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery). The vulnerability in question involves a web server improperly handling URLs or requests, potentially allowing an attacker to bypass access controls or use the server as a proxy for malicious activities.

In the `convert_bookformat` function, there is no evidence of URL handling or request forgery. The function simply retrieves form data, logs the conversion process, and calls a helper function to perform the book format conversion. There is no interaction with external URLs or handling of incoming requests that could be manipulated by an attacker in the context of this function.

However, it's important to note that without the full context of how `helper.convert_book_format` and `request.form.get` are implemented, it's not possible to definitively rule out all potential vulnerabilities. But based on the provided code snippet alone, there is no indication of a CWE-918 vulnerability.","
