The provided Python code snippet for the `get_response` function does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server Side Request Forgery) based on the information given. The vulnerability described in CWE-918 involves the web server not ensuring that a URL or similar request is being sent to the expected destination, which could allow attackers to bypass access controls.

In the provided code, the `get_response` function is making an HTTP request using the `requests` library, which is a common and secure way to make HTTP requests in Python. The code does not directly handle or manipulate URLs or HTTP requests in a way that would expose it to CWE-918 vulnerability.

However, it is important to note that the security of the code also depends on the context in which it is used, the configuration of the environment, and the version of the libraries being used. The code should be reviewed in the context of the entire application and its environment to ensure that there are no other potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that could lead to security issues.","
The CVE-ID is CVE-2021-43780. The CWE-ID is CWE-918.

Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue.

The provided code snippet for `is_private_address` is not vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server Side Request Forgery) as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2021-43780 related to Redash. The function `is_private_address` simply parses a URL to get the hostname, resolves the hostname to an IP address, and checks if the IP address is private. It does not involve any request handling or URL processing that could be exploited for SSRF.

The second function `kthLargestNumber` is unrelated to the vulnerability described and is a separate algorithm to find the kth largest number in a list of strings. It does not involve any web server request handling or URL processing.","

The vulnerability CWE-918 involves a web server improperly handling URLs or requests, potentially allowing an attacker to bypass access controls. The code snippet you've shared is a Python function that seems to be part of a web application handling user profiles. It does not involve any URL handling or request processing that would expose it to SSRF vulnerabilities.

The function `profile()` appears to be a view function that retrieves user language preferences, checks for Kobo support, and conditionally retrieves OAuth status. It then renders a user profile template. There is no evidence in the provided code that it is making any external requests or handling URLs in a way that could lead to SSRF.

The second function `kthLargestNumber` is a separate function that seems to be unrelated to the web server's request handling and is focused on finding the kth largest number in a list. It does not involve any web server request processing or URL handling.

The provided code snippet is not vulnerable to the CWE-ID CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery) as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2022-0939. The vulnerability described in CWE-918 involves a web server that does not properly validate or sanitize URLs or other inputs that it retrieves from an upstream component, potentially allowing an attacker to make the server send requests to unintended destinations.

In the given code, the function `render_books_list` does not involve any server-side request handling or URL retrieval based on external input. It simply takes a `data` parameter and uses it to determine which book list to render. The `data` parameter is a string that is compared against a set of predefined values, and based on the value, a corresponding function is called to render the book list. There is no interaction with external URLs or resources based on user input, and no server-side request is made.

Therefore, the code snippet is not vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery) as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2022-0939.","

The provided code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in CWE-918. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `calibre_db.fill_indexpage` function, which retrieves content based on a URL or similar request from an upstream component. If the `sort_param` or other parts of the request are not properly validated or sanitized, an attacker could manipulate the request to target an unexpected destination.

For example, if the `sort_param` is directly used to construct a URL or request without proper validation, an attacker could inject a malicious URL that the server would then attempt to access. This could potentially bypass access controls like firewalls and allow the attacker to use the server as a proxy for accessing restricted resources or conducting port scanning on internal networks.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to validate and sanitize all user-supplied input, including URLs and other request parameters, before using them to make external requests. Additionally, implementing proper access controls and using secure methods for handling external requests can help prevent SSRF attacks.","

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `urlquote` function is used to sanitize the `bad_url` and `good_url` variables before they are included in the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` strings. The `urlquote` function is intended to encode special characters in URLs to prevent them from being interpreted as control characters in the browser. However, the code does not properly handle the case where the `bad_url` or `good_url` contains JavaScript code or other potentially malicious content.

In the `test_security_check` function, the `urlquote` function is used to sanitize the `bad_url` and `good_url` variables before they are included in the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` strings. However, the `urlquote` function is not shown in the provided code, so we cannot be sure that it properly sanitizes the input. If the `urlquote` function does not properly sanitize the input, it could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` strings.

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

CWE description:
The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Extended description:

            Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:
            
               Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)
               Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and
               Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)
            
            When any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.
            There are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:
               
                  Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.
                  Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a type of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles the `recipe.link` URL. The code replaces 'www.dropbox.' with 'dl.dropboxusercontent.' in the URL before making the request. This manipulation can be exploited by an attacker to craft a malicious URL that points to an internal or sensitive resource on the server or its network.

For example, an attacker could provide a URL like 'http://localhost/secret/file' as the `recipe.link`. The server would then replace 'www.dropbox.' with 'dl.dropboxusercontent.' resulting in 'http://dl.dropboxusercontent.localhost/secret/file'. When the server makes the request to this URL, it could potentially access sensitive files or internal resources on the server or its network.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the `recipe.link` before making the request. This could involve checking that the URL is a valid Dropbox share link and does not contain any unexpected hosts or ports. Additionally, the server should implement proper access controls to prevent unauthorized access to internal resources.","

These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, ""GET /index.html HTTP/1.1"" is a structured message containing a command (""GET"") with a single argument (""/index.html"") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (""HTTP/1.1"").
            If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

A web application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site, and uses that link in a Redirect. This simplifies phishing attacks.

Extended description:
An http parameter may contain a URL value and could cause the web application to redirect the request to the specified URL. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts have a more trustworthy appearance. Whether this issue poses a vulnerability will be subject to the intended behavior of the application. For example, a search engine might intentionally provide redirects to arbitrary URLs.

CWE description:
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

In version 1.2.4, the proxy method in bazarr/bazarr/app/ui.py does not validate the user-controlled protocol and url variables and passes them to requests.get() without any sanitization, which leads to a blind server-side request forgery (SSRF). This issue allows for crafting GET requests to internal and external resources on behalf of the server. 1.3.1 contains a partial fix, which limits the vulnerability to HTTP/HTTPS protocols.'}]

CWE description:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

Extended description:
By providing URLs to unexpected hosts or ports, attackers can make it appear that the server is sending the request, possibly bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly. The server can be used as a proxy to conduct port scanning of hosts in internal networks, use other URLs such as that can access documents on the system (using file://), or use other protocols such as gopher:// or tftp://, which may provide greater control over the contents of requests.

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, specifically Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent). The vulnerability arises from the way custom field values are rendered and displayed in the web page. The code uses the `get_cell` method to retrieve the rendered value of a custom field column, which is then directly compared to an expected value. If the `get_cell` method does not properly sanitize or escape the output before rendering it to the web page, an attacker could inject malicious scripts into the custom field values.

For example, if an attacker can manipulate the `custom_column_expected` dictionary and insert a script tag or other malicious content into one of the values, and if the `get_cell` method does not sanitize the output, the injected script could be executed when the web page is rendered. This could lead to various attacks, such as stealing sensitive information, performing actions on behalf of the user, or compromising the user's machine.

To fix this vulnerability, the `get_cell` method should be modified to properly escape or sanitize the output before rendering it to the web page. This can be achieved by using a library or function that is designed to handle the escaping of user-controlled input, such as Django's `mark_safe` or `escape` functions","

[{'lang': 'en', 'value': ""Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform built as a web application All users of Nautobot versions earlier than 1.6.6 or 2.0.5 are potentially affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability. Due to incorrect usage of Django's `mark_safe()` API when rendering certain types of user-authored content; including custom links, job buttons, and computed fields; it is possible that users with permission to create or edit these types of content could craft a malicious payload (such as JavaScript code) that would be executed when rendering pages containing this content. The maintainers have fixed the incorrect uses of `mark_safe()` (generally by replacing them with appropriate use of `format_html()` instead) to prevent such malicious data from being executed. Users on Nautobot 1.6.x LTM should upgrade to v1.6.6 and users on Nautobot 2.0.x should upgrade to v2.0.5. Appropriate object permissions can and should be applied to restrict which users are permitted to create or edit the aforementioned types of user-authored content.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The provided code snippet for `convert_bookformat` does not exhibit the vulnerability described by CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery). The vulnerability CWE-918 involves a web server improperly handling URLs or similar requests, potentially allowing an attacker to bypass access controls or use the server as a proxy for unauthorized activities.

In the `convert_bookformat` function, there is no evidence of URL handling or processing that would lead to such a vulnerability. The function simply retrieves form data, logs the conversion process, and calls a helper function to perform the book format conversion. There is no interaction with external URLs or handling of user-supplied input that could be used to forge a request to an unintended destination.

However, it is important to note that without the full context of how `helper.convert_book_format` and `config.config_calibre_dir` are implemented, it is not possible to definitively rule out all potential vulnerabilities. But based on the provided code snippet alone, there is no indication of a CWE-918 vulnerability.","
