The provided Python code is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is related to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses the `requests` library to make HTTP requests to external URLs without proper validation or sanitization of the input URL. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `url` parameter to cause the server to make requests to unintended destinations, which could lead to information disclosure, data manipulation, or other security breaches.

In the context of the provided code, the `get_response` function does not perform any checks on the `url` parameter to ensure that it is a safe and expected destination. If an attacker can control the `url` parameter, they could craft a URL that points to a malicious server or an internal server that should not be accessible from the outside. This could allow the attacker to bypass access controls and potentially access sensitive information or perform unautrighted actions on behalf of the server.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should implement proper input validation and whitelisting of allowed URLs. Additionally, using a library like Advocate, as mentioned in the CVE description, can help prevent SSRF by making HTTP requests in a more secure manner.","

[{'lang': 'en', 'value': ""Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly.

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-918, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the use of the `calibre_db.fill_indexpage` function, which retrieves data from the database based on the `data` parameter. If an attacker can manipulate the `data` parameter to point to an unexpected host or port, they could potentially make the server send requests to that host or port. This could bypass access controls like firewalls and allow the attacker to use the server as a proxy for their own requests.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `data` parameter is properly validated and sanitized before being used in the `calibre_db.fill_indexpage` function. Additionally, you should implement proper access controls and whitelisting of allowed hosts and ports to prevent unauthorized access.","

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-918, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not validate or sanitize the input for the 'data' parameter, which is used to determine the type of books to render. If an attacker can manipulate the 'data' parameter to point to an unexpected or malicious URL, the server might attempt to retrieve content from that URL, potentially bypassing access controls and exposing sensitive information or allowing the attacker to use the server as a proxy for their own malicious activities.

To fix this vulnerability, you should validate the 'data' parameter against a whitelist of allowed values before using it to determine the type of books to render. Additionally, you should ensure that any URLs or external resources used in the rendering process are properly validated and sanitized to prevent SSRF attacks.","

The provided code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in CWE-918. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code retrieves the contents of URLs without sufficient validation or sanitization.

In the code, the `calibre_db.fill_indexpage` function is called with the `db_filter` parameter, which is constructed using the `config.config_read_column` value. This value is retrieved from the `db.cc_classes` dictionary, which is assumed to be populated with user-defined custom columns.

The vulnerability occurs when an attacker can manipulate the `config.config_read_column` value to point to an unexpected host or port. This can be done by injecting a malicious URL or by manipulating the configuration settings. When the `calibre_db.fill_indexpage` function retrieves the contents of the URL, it can lead to SSRF, as the server is used as a proxy to access the URL.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the `config.config_read_column` value before using it to construct the `db_filter`. This can be done by ensuring that the value only contains valid column names or by whitelisting allowed column names. Additionally, the code should implement proper access controls","

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `test_security_check` function handles user-controlled input in the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` variables. The `urlquote` function is used to encode the `bad_url` and `good_url` variables, but it does not sanitize the input to ensure that it does not contain any executable code or scripts.

In the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` strings, the user-controlled input is directly concatenated with the `login_url` and `REDIRECT_FIELD_NAME` variables. If an attacker can control the `bad_url` or `good_url` input, they can inject malicious scripts that will be executed when the URL is accessed by the victim.

For example, an attacker could provide a `bad_url` or `good_url` input like `http://example.com/script.js?next=http://malicious.com/script.js`, which would result in the execution of the `script.js` file hosted on the attacker's server when the URL is accessed.

The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

            When any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.
            There are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:
               
                  Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.
                  Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a type of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles the replacement of the domain in the `recipe.link` URL. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `recipe.link` to point to an internal or sensitive resource on the server or even to a different server altogether.

In the `get_file` function, the code replaces 'www.dropbox.' with 'dl.dropboxusercontent.' in the `recipe.link` URL before making a GET request. This replacement is done without any validation or sanitization of the input URL. An attacker could craft a `recipe.link` that includes a different domain or a local file path (e.g., 'file:///etc/passwd') that the server would then attempt to access.

This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, bypassing of access controls, or even the server being used as a proxy for other malicious activities.

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

If the `smuggle_url` function is similar to the one described in the CVE-2023-46121 for yt-dlp, it could be vulnerable to HTTP smuggling attacks.

HTTP smuggling attacks exploit inconsistencies in how different HTTP agents interpret headers, particularly when it comes to handling duplicate or different header fields. An attacker can craft malicious HTTP requests that cause the intermediary HTTP agent (in this case, the `smuggle_url` function) to misinterpret the request, potentially allowing the attacker to bypass security checks or perform other malicious actions.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `smuggle_url` function (or any other function used to construct HTTP requests) is properly handling HTTP headers and is not susceptible to HTTP smuggling attacks.

The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The provided `swaggerui_static` function is vulnerable to CWE-22, which is a path traversal vulnerability. The function takes a `filename` parameter and uses it to construct a file path by joining it with a series of directory paths. Since the `filename` is directly concatenated to the path without any validation or sanitization, an attacker could provide a malicious `filename` that includes path traversal sequences like ""../"" to access files outside of the intended directory. This could lead to unauthorized file access and potentially expose sensitive information or allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code.","
The CVE-ID is CVE-2023-50265. The CWE-ID is CWE-22.

CWE description:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

Extended description:

            Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as "".."" and ""/"" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the ""../"" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as ""/usr/local/bin"" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-controlled input in the `LocationTable` rendering process. The vulnerability arises from the use of Django's `mark_safe()` function, which is not used in the code but is mentioned in the context of the vulnerability description.

The `LocationTable` class is likely to render user-controlled input (such as custom field values) into HTML without properly escaping or sanitizing the content. This can lead to XSS attacks if an attacker is able to inject malicious scripts into the custom field values.

The CVE description mentions that the vulnerability is due to the incorrect usage of Django's `mark_safe()` function, which allows unescaped HTML to be rendered in the output. Although the provided code does not explicitly show the usage of `mark_safe()`, it is implied that the `LocationTable` class or its methods may be using it or a similar approach to render custom field values.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that all user-controlled input is properly escaped or sanitized before being rendered into HTML. This can be achieved by using Django's built-in template system, which automatically escapes variables by default, or by using the `escape()` function from the `django.utils.html` module to manually escape user","

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.
