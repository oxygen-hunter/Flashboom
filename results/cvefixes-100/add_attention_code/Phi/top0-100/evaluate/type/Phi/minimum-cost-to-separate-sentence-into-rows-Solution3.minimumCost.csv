The provided Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server Side Request Forgery) as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2EE-2021-43780. The code is a simple function that makes an HTTP request to a given URL and handles the response. It does not involve any server-side processing of user-supplied URLs that could be used to forge requests to unintended destinations. The vulnerability described in CVE-2EE-2021-43780 is specific to Redash and involves the use of the requests library to load data sources, which is not present in the provided code snippet.","

[{'lang': 'en', 'value': ""Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly.

The code snippet is a function that updates a user's profile information based on form data. It does not involve any URL or request handling that would allow an attacker to forge a server-side request.

The function `change_profile` takes form data, validates and sanitizes the input, and updates the user's profile information in the database. It does not involve any network operations or external requests that could be manipulated by an attacker.

However, it is essential to ensure that the form data is properly validated and sanitized to prevent other types of vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS). The code snippet provided does not show the implementation of the functions `valid_email`, `check_email`, and `check_username`, which should be carefully designed to prevent such vulnerabilities.

In conclusion, based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of SSRF vulnerability. However, it is crucial to ensure that the entire application, including form handling and data validation, is secure against other potential vulnerabilities.","

The provided code snippet for the `language_right_overview` function does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery) based on the information given. The function `speaking_language` from `calibre_db` is called with parameters that do not involve external URLs or user-controlled input that could be manipulated to forge a request. The parameters `reverse_order` and `with_count` are boolean values and do not involve any URL or request handling that could be exploited for SSRF.

However, without the full context of how `calibre_db.speaking_language` is implemented and how it interacts with external resources, it is not possible to definitively conclude that there is no vulnerability. The code provided does not show any direct handling of URLs or requests that could be manipulated by an attacker.","

The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-ID CVE-2022-0939 or the CWE-ID CWE-918 as described. The code is a login function that handles LDAP authentication and has a fallback mechanism for password-based authentication. The potential vulnerability mentioned in the CWE-ID CWE-918 involves a server-side request forgery (SSRF) where the server sends a request to an unexpected destination, potentially bypassing access controls.

In the provided code, there is no evidence of SSRF or similar vulnerabilities. The code does not involve sending requests to external servers or handling user-supplied URLs that could be manipulated for SSRF attacks. The code is focused on authenticating users and redirecting them based on their login status.

However, it is essential to note that without a complete understanding of the application's context and the surrounding codebase, it is challenging to definitively determine the presence or absence of vulnerabilities. It is always recommended to perform a thorough security review and testing to ensure the application's security.","

The vulnerability lies in the `render_books_list` function, specifically in the `render_search_results` and `render_adv_search_results` functions. These functions use `request.args.get('query')` and `flask_session['query']` to retrieve the search query from the request arguments and the Flask session, respectively.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the request arguments or the Flask session to send a malicious URL to the server. This can be done by crafting a request with a URL that points to an internal or external resource that the server should not access. The server will then attempt to retrieve the contents of the URL, potentially bypassing access controls and exposing sensitive information or allowing the attacker to use the server as a proxy for other malicious activities.

To fix this vulnerability, you should validate and sanitize the input received from the request arguments and the Flask session before using it to retrieve data from the server. You can use a whitelist approach to ensure that only valid and expected URLs are processed, or you can use a library like `urllib.parse` to parse and validate the URLs before using them. Additionally, you should implement proper access controls and authentication mechanisms to prevent","

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code retrieves a URL from an upstream component (in this case, the `order` parameter) and does not sufficiently validate or sanitize it before using it to make a request to an external service (calibre_db). This can allow an attacker to manipulate the URL to make the server send requests to unintended destinations, potentially bypassing access controls and using the server as a proxy for malicious activities.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the `order` parameter before using it to make requests to calibre_db.

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `test_security_check` function handles the `bad_url` and `good_url` parameters when constructing the `nasty_url` and `safe_url`. The `urlquote` function is used to escape the URLs, but it does not guarantee that all forms of XSS are neutralized.

The `urlquote` function is not a standard Python function and may not be implemented correctly to handle all cases of XSS. If the `urlquote` function does not properly escape or sanitize the input, it could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the URL parameters.

For example, if an attacker can control the `bad_url` or `good_url` parameter, they might be able to inject a script that gets executed when the URL is used in the `client.post` method. This could lead to XSS attacks where the attacker's script is executed in the context of the web server's domain, violating the same-origin policy.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `urlquote` function properly escapes all characters that could be used in an XSS attack, such as `<`, `>`, `""`, `'`, and `&`. Additionally, you should consider using a well-est","

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

CWE description:
The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

               Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and

            When any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.
            There are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:
               
                  Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.
                  Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a type of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles the replacement of the domain in the URL. An attacker could manipulate the `recipe.link` to point to an internal or unintended server by replacing 'www.dropbox.' with a different domain. This could potentially allow the attacker to access sensitive information or perform actions on behalf of the server.

In the code snippet:

```python
response = requests.get(recipe.right.replace('www.dropbox.', 'dl.dropboxusercontent.'))
```

The `replace` method is used to change the domain of the URL. If an attacker can control the `recipe.link` value, they could replace 'www.dropbox.' with a malicious domain that the server is allowed to access, such as an internal server or a server under the attacker's control. This would cause the server to send a request to the attacker's server, effectively using the server as a proxy.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate the `recipe.link` to ensure it only contains expected and safe domains before making the HTTP request. Additionally, implementing proper access controls and network segmentation can help prevent unauthorized access","

These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, ""GET /index.html HTTP/1.1"" is a structured message containing a command (""GET"") with a single argument (""/index.html"") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (""HTTP/1.1"").
            If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The provided Python code for the `swaggerui_static` function is vulnerable to CWE-22, which is an Improper Input Handling vulnerability, specifically a Path Traversal vulnerability. This vulnerability arises because the function takes a `filename` parameter and uses it to construct a file path without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker could exploit this by providing a malicious `filename` that includes path traversal sequences like ""../"" to access files outside of the intended directory.

In the context of the CVE-ID CVE-2023-50264, the vulnerability is similar in that it involves the use of user-controlled input to construct a file path without proper validation, leading to an arbitrary file read. The `swaggerui_static` function does not check the `filename` for any path traversal patterns or other malicious content, which could allow an attacker to read sensitive files from the server's file system.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `swaggerui_static` function should validate the `filename` parameter to ensure it does not contain any path traversal sequences or other unexpected characters. Additionally, it should only allow access to files within a predefined and restricted directory.","

The provided Python code for the `swaggerui_static` function is vulnerable to CWE-22, which is a path traversal vulnerability. The function takes a `filename` parameter and uses it to construct a file path by joining it with a predefined directory path. If an attacker can control the `filename` input, they could potentially supply a string that navigates up the directory tree (using ""../"") or specifies a different file outside the intended directory. This could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files on the server that the application has access to, leading to information disclosure or other security issues.

To fix this vulnerability, the application should validate the `filename` input to ensure it does not contain any path traversal sequences or other unexpected characters. This can be done by using a whitelist approach, where only known good filenames are allowed, or by sanitizing the input to remove or encode potentially dangerous characters.","

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-controlled input in the `test_custom_field_table_render` function. The `LocationTable` class is being initialized with a queryset that filters `Location` objects based on the `name` attribute, which could be user-controlled input. If the `Location` model allows for user-controlled input in the `name` field and the `LocationTable` class does not properly sanitize or escape this input when rendering the table, it could lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

The `bound_row.get_cell(internal_col_name)` method call is particularly concerning because it retrieves the value of a cell based on a column name that is constructed by appending ""cf_"" to the `col_name`. If the `col_name` is derived from user input and is not properly sanitized or escaped, it could lead to XSS when the value is rendered in the web page.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that any user-controlled input is properly sanitized and escaped before being used in the `LocationTable` class and when rendering the table. You can use Django's built-in template system, which automatically escapes variables unless explicitly marked as safe. Additionally, you should review the `LocationTable` class and its methods","

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.
