[{'lang': 'en', 'value': ""Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly.

A web application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site, and uses that link in a Redirect. This simplifies phishing attacks.

Extended description:
An http parameter may contain a URL value and could cause the web application to redirect the request to the specified URL. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts have a more trustworthy appearance. Whether this issue poses a vulnerability will be subject to the intended behavior of the application. For example, a search engine might intentionally provide redirects to arbitrary URLs.

The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-ID CVE-2022-0939 (Server-Side Request Forgery, SSRF) as described. The code snippet is a login function that handles user authentication and does not involve any request handling or redirection to external URLs based on user input.

The CVE-ID CVE-2022-0939 (SSRF) vulnerability typically occurs when a web application accepts user input and uses it to make requests to external resources without proper validation or sanitization. This can allow an attacker to manipulate the requests and potentially access sensitive information or perform unautious actions.

In the provided code, the user input is used for authentication purposes (username and password), and there is no evidence of the input being used to make requests to external resources. The code does not involve any redirection or interaction with external services based on user input.

However, it is essential to note that the code snippet provided is not the complete codebase, and there might be other parts of the code that could be vulnerable to SSRF or other security issues. It is always recommended to perform a thorough security review and testing of the entire codebase to identify and mitigate any potential vulnerabilities.","

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a type of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not validate or sanitize the `book_id` parameter before using it to query the database. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `book_id` to cause the server to make requests to unintended destinations.

In the code, the `calibre_db.get_book_read_archived` function is called with the `book_id` parameter, which is then used to query the database for book information. If the `book_id` is not properly validated, an attacker could provide a malicious `book_id` that causes the server to retrieve data from an unintended source or perform actions on behalf of the attacker.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `book_id` is properly validated and sanitized before using it in any database queries or other operations. This can be done by implementing input validation checks, such as ensuring that the `book_id` is a valid integer and within an expected range, or by using prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. Additionally, you should consider implementing access controls and other security measures to protect against unautrighted access to sensitive data.","

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-controlled input in the URL parameters. Specifically, the code is vulnerable to Type 1: Reflected XSS (Non-Persistent) attacks.

In the `test_security_check` function, the code iterates over a list of bad URLs and constructs a `nasty_url` by appending the `bad_url` to the `login_url` with the `REDIRECT_EE_NAME` parameter. The `bad_url` is URL-encoded using `urlquote`, but this is not sufficient to prevent XSS attacks.

The vulnerability arises when the `nasty_url` is used in the `self.client.post` method call, which simulates a POST request to the `login_url` with the `bad_url` as a parameter. If an attacker can control the `bad_url` parameter, they can inject malicious scripts into the URL, which will be reflected back to the victim's browser when they access the `nasty_url`.

For example, an attacker could craft a `bad_url` like `'http://example.com/script.js'`, which would be reflected back to the victim's browser as part of the dynamic content generated by the `","

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a type of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles the `recipe.link` URL. The code replaces 'www.dropbox.' with 'dl.dropboxusercontent.' in the URL before making the request. This manipulation of the URL can be exploited by an attacker to make the server send requests to arbitrary hosts or ports, potentially bypassing access controls and firewalls.

An attacker could craft a malicious `recipe.link` that points to a different server or service, and the server would still process the request as if it were intended for Dropbox. This could lead to unautrighted access to sensitive information or other security breaches.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate the `recipe.link` URL to ensure it points to the expected Dropbox service and does not contain any unexpected hosts or ports.

The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

Extended description:

            Improper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.
            Most products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, ""GET /index.html HTTP/1.1"" is a structured message containing a command (""GET"") with a single argument (""/index.html"") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (""HTTP/1.1"").
            If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

The provided Python code is vulnerable to CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in OS Command)"" because it executes code retrieved from an external source without proper validation or sanitization. The `exec()` function is used to execute the code contained in the `code` variable, which is obtained from `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`. If an attacker can control the content of the file being loaded, they could inject malicious code that would be executed by the `exec()` function.

In this case, the vulnerability is similar to CVE-2021-23422, where an untrusted source file containing Inline Tag Command metadata is processed, and arbitrary OS commands can be executed. The `exec()` function does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended behavior when the code is executed.

The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

The provided Python code is vulnerable to CWE-444, which is related to HTTP smuggling attacks. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `smuggle_url` function, which is not shown in the code snippet but is referenced in the `_parse_video` method. If `smuggle_url` is similar to the vulnerable `smuggle` function described in the CVE-2023-46121, it could be susceptible to HTTP smuggling attacks.

HTTP smuggling attacks exploit inconsistencies in how different HTTP agents (such as proxies, firewalls, or load balancers) parse and interpret HTTP requests. An attacker can craft a request that is interpreted differently by the smuggling function and the target server, potentially allowing the attacker to bypass security controls or inject malicious content.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `smuggle_url` function (or any similar function) is designed to handle HTTP requests and responses consistently with the target server's expectations. This may involve updating the function to use a more secure HTTP parsing library or implementing additional checks to prevent malicious input from being processed.","

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles error messages. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the error message is directly included in the HTTP response without proper sanitization or escaping. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the error message, which could then be executed by the victim's browser when they view the error page.

In the code snippet, the error message is passed through the `force_text` function and then directly included in the JSON response (`HttpResponseForbidden`) or in the URL for the login page (`login_url`). If an attacker can control the `reason` parameter, they could craft a string that includes JavaScript code, which would be executed when the error page is rendered by the browser.

To fix this vulnerability, the error message should be properly escaped before being included in the HTTP response or URL. This can be done using functions like `escape` or `html.escape` (in Python 3.3 and later) to ensure that any special characters are converted to their corresponding HTML entities, preventing the browser from interpreting them as executable code.","

The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

Extended description:

            Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as "".."" and ""/"" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the ""../"" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as ""/usr/local/bin"" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-controlled input in the `test_custom_field_table_render` function. The vulnerability arises from the use of Django's `mark_safe` function, which is not used in the provided code but is mentioned in the context of the CVE-2020-4875. The `mark_safe` function is used to mark a string as safe (i.e., safe to be rendered in a template without escaping). If user-controlled input is passed to `mark_safe` without proper sanitization, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

In the provided code, the `custom_column_expected` dictionary contains values that are rendered in the template. If any of these values contain user-controlled input that is not properly sanitized, it could lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

To fix this issue, you should ensure that any user-controlled input is properly sanitized before being rendered in the template. You can use Django's built-in template filters like `escape` or `escapejs` to sanitize the input. Additionally, you should review the use of `mark_safe` in your codebase and ensure that it is used correctly, as mentioned in the CVE-2020-4","

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.
