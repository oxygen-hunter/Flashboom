[{'lang': 'en', 'value': ""Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly.

The `minDifference` function is unrelated to the `download_list` function and does not involve any network operations or URL handling that could be susceptible to SSRF. It is a local algorithm for finding the minimum difference between elements in a list.

However, without the full context of how the `ub.session.query` and `ub.Downloads` objects work, and how the `render_title_template` function is implemented, it is not possible to definitively say that there are no vulnerabilities. But based on the provided code snippet alone, there is no indication of SSRF or CWE-918 vulnerability.","

The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2022-0939. The code snippet is a login function that handles user authentication and does not involve processing or handling external requests that could be manipulated by an attacker to forge requests to internal services.

The SSRF vulnerability typically occurs when an application accepts user input and uses it to construct a request to an internal or external service without proper validation or sanitization. In the provided code, the user input is used for authentication purposes (username and password), and there is no indication of the application making requests to other services based on user input.

However, it is essential to note that the code snippet provided is not the complete application, and without the full context, it is not possible to definitively determine the security of the application. It is always recommended to conduct a thorough security review and testing to ensure the application is secure against various vulnerabilities, including SSRF.","

The provided code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in CWE-918. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `calibre_db.fill_indexpage` function, which retrieves content from URLs or similar requests. If the `sort_param` or other parameters passed to this function are not properly validated or sanitized, an attacker could manipulate these parameters to cause the server to make requests to unintended destinations.

For example, if an attacker can control the `sort_param` and set it to a malicious URL, the server might fetch content from that URL, potentially bypassing access controls like firewalls. This could lead to information disclosure, server compromise, or other security issues.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize all user-supplied input, especially those used in constructing URLs or requests. Additionally, the application should implement proper access controls and whitelist allowed destinations for any outbound requests.","

The provided code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in CWE-918. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `calibre_db.fill_indexpage` function, which retrieves content from URLs or similar requests without sufficient validation or sanitization. If an attacker can manipulate the parameters passed to this function, they could potentially make the server send requests to unintended destinations.

For example, if the `order` parameter is controlled by the user and not properly validated, an attacker could craft a malicious URL that the server would attempt to access. This could lead to unauthorized access to internal resources or bypassing of security controls like firewalls.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize all user-supplied input, especially when it is used to construct URLs or requests to external services.

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `urlquote` function is used to sanitize the `bad_url` and `good_url` variables before they are included in the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` strings. The `urlquote` function is intended to encode special characters in URLs to prevent them from being interpreted as control characters in the browser. However, the vulnerability arises from the fact that the `urlquote` function may not be sufficient to prevent XSS in all cases, especially when the URLs contain JavaScript code or other executable content.

In the code, the `urlquote` function is used to sanitize the `bad_url` and `good_url` variables, but it is not clear if this function is implemented correctly or if it covers all possible XSS attack vectors. If the `urlquote` function does not properly encode or escape all potentially dangerous characters, it could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` strings.

For example, if an attacker can control the `bad_url` or `good_url` variable, they could potentially inject a script tag or other executable content that would be included in the `nasty_url` or `safe_url` strings. When","

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

CWE description:
The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Extended description:

            Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:
            
               Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)
               Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and
               Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)
            
            When any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.
            There are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:
               
                  Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.
                  Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a type of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles the URL for the Dropbox file retrieval. The code replaces 'www.dropbox.' with 'dl.dropboxusercontent.' in the `recipe.link` URL before making the GET request. This replacement is done without any validation or sanitization of the input URL.

An attacker could exploit this by providing a malicious URL that redirects the server to an internal or sensitive resource. For example, an attacker could craft a URL that points to an internal service or file that the server has access to, and the server would then make a request to that internal resource, potentially leaking sensitive information.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the input URL before making the request. This could involve checking that the URL is a valid Dropbox link, ensuming it points to a legitimate Dropbox resource, and ensuring that it does not contain any unexpected or malicious components. Additionally, implementing proper access controls and network segmentation can help prevent unauthorized access to internal resources.","

Extended description:

            Improper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.
            Most products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, ""GET /index.html HTTP/1.1"" is a structured message containing a command (""GET"") with a single argument (""/index.html"") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (""HTTP/1.1"").
            If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the specific issue described in the CVE-2012-3426 vulnerability. The CVE-2012-EEEE vulnerability is related to improper token validation in OpenStack, which could allow an attacker to bypass authentication by creating a token for a disabled user account.

In the provided code, the authentication process checks if the user is enabled before creating a token. If the user is disabled, an exception is raised, preventing the creation of a token for that user. This approach mitigates the risk of creating a token for a disabled user account, which is the primary concern in the CVE-2012-3426 vulnerability.

However, it is essential to note that this code is a simplified version of the authentication process and may not cover all aspects of the actual implementation in OpenStack. The real-world implementation should be thoroughly reviewed and tested to ensure it is not vulnerable to any other issues.","

The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

The provided Python code is vulnerable due to the use of the `exec` function, which executes the code it receives as a string. This can be a significant security risk if the source of the code is not trusted, as it can lead to arbitrary code execution. In the context of CWE-22, which involves the use of external input to construct a pathname that can lead to unauthorized file access, the vulnerability here is slightly different but still related to the execution of untrusted code.

In the `load` function, `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")` is used to retrieve a file, and then `exec` is used to execute the contents of that file. If an attacker can control the contents of the ""bs-extensions"" file, they could potentially inject malicious code that gets executed by the `exec` call. This could lead to a variety of security issues, including unautrighted file access, data leakage, or even remote code execution, depending on the context in which the `load` function is used.

The CWE-22 description provided in the question seems to be more related to file path traversal vulnerabilities, which is not directly applicable to the given code snippet.

The code is a test function for a web API endpoint and a function to find the minimum difference between the kth smallest and kth largest elements in an array. The vulnerability described in CWE-352 typically involves a situation where an application uses user-supplied input in a format string function (like `printf` in C) without proper validation, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

The test function `test_right_broken_body` is testing the behavior of a web API endpoint when it receives different types of payloads. It does not involve any format string functions or similar constructs that would lead to a CWE-352 vulnerability.

The `minDifference` function is a Python function that operates on a list of integers and does not involve any user input that could be used in a format string function.

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

Extended description:

            Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as "".."" and ""/"" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the ""../"" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as ""/usr/local/bin"" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.

The provided `swaggerui_static` function is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a type of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises because the function takes a filename as an input and returns the contents of that file without validating the input. An attacker could potentially manipulate the filename to point to a different file or even a URL that the server can access, leading to unauthorized access to internal or external resources.

In the context of the CVE-ID CVE-2023-50266, the vulnerability is similar in that it involves the server retrieving contents from a URL without proper validation, which could lead to SSRF attacks. The `swaggerui_static` function does not perform any checks on the `filename` parameter to ensure it is a safe path or a valid file within the intended directory. This lack of validation could allow an attacker to craft a `filename` that points to a different file or a URL, which the server would then retrieve and serve to the client.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the function should validate the `filename` parameter to ensure it only points to files within the intended directory and does not contain any malicious input that could lead to SSRF. This could involve checking the file path against a whitelist of allowed paths or using a more secure method","

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-controlled input in the `custom_column_expected` dictionary. The values in this dictionary are hardcoded strings that could potentially include malicious JavaScript code. If an attacker can manipulate the values in this dictionary, they could inject malicious scripts that would be executed when the `bound_row.get_cell(internal_col_name)` method is called.

For example, if an attacker can modify the value of `custom_column_expected['url_right']` to something like:

```python
""<script>alert('XSS')</script>""
```

And if this value is used in a context where it is rendered as HTML without proper sanitization, the script would be executed in the user's browser, leading to a successful XSS attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the application should ensure that any user-controlled input is properly sanitized and escaped before being rendered in the web page. This can be done by using Django's built-in template system, which automatically escapes variables unless explicitly marked as safe. Additionally, the application should use the `format_html` function from `django.utils.html` to safely format HTML content.","

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.
