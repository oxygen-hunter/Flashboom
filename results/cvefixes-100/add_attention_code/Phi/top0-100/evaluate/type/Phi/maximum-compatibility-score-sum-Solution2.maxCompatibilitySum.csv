These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue.

The provided Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CWE-601 issue described. The code is a function that sets up a worker home server (HS) instance and connects it to a master HS, handling the replication stream between them. It also sets up a resource for the worker HS and registers it for HTTP replication attempts.

The CWE-601 issue involves accepting user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site, which the application then uses in a redirect. This can lead to phishing attacks. However, the provided code does not involve any user-controlled input for external links or redirects. It is focused on setting up a home server and handling replication, which does not involve any user-controlled input for external links or redirects.

Therefore, the provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CWE-601 issue described.","

The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-ID CVE-2022-0939 or the CWE-ID CWE-918 as described. The code is a Python function for matching students with mentors based on their preferences and compatibility. It does not involve any web server request handling or URL processing that could lead to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.

The CWE-ID CWE-918 (SSRF) vulnerability occurs when a web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL without ensuring that the request is being sent to the expected destination. This can lead to various security issues, such as bypassing access controls or using the server as a proxy for unauthorized access.

The provided code does not involve any such behavior. It is a function that takes two lists of lists as input (students and mentors) and calculates the maximum compatibility sum based on the preferences and compatibility of students and mentors. The function does not interact with any web server or handle any URLs, so it is not vulnerable to SSRF or related issues.","

The provided Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CWE-918 and CVE-2022-0939. The code is a function that renders a list of books based on different criteria (like ""rated"", ""discover"", ""unread"", etc.), and it does not involve any network request handling or URL processing that could be manipulated for SSRF attacks.

The function `render_books_list` takes parameters for data, sort_param, book_id, and page, and it uses these parameters to call different rendering functions based on the value of `data`. The function does not execute or evaluate any external input that could be used for SSRF. It simply delegates to other functions that are not shown in the provided code snippet.

Without seeing the implementation of the functions like `render_rated_books`, `render_discover_books`, etc., we cannot definitively say that there is no vulnerability. However, based on the provided code snippet alone, there is no indication of SSRF vulnerability.","

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `test_security_check` function constructs the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` using string formatting with user-controlled input (`bad_url` and `good_url`). If an attacker can control the values of `bad_url` or `good_url`, they could inject malicious scripts into the URLs, which could be executed when the URLs are accessed by the web browser.

For example, an attacker could craft a `bad_url` like `'http://example.com/script.js'`, and if this is not properly sanitized and the `urlquote` function does not handle JavaScript URIs, it could lead to an XSS vulnerability. The `urlquote` function is supposed to sanitize the input, but if it does not handle all cases correctly, it could allow malicious scripts to pass through.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that all user-controlled input is properly sanitized and encoded before being used in URL construction. Additionally, the `urlquote` function should be thoroughly reviewed and tested to ensure it can handle all possible cases of user input, including JavaScript URIs and other potentially malicious content.","

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

               Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and

            When any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.
            There are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:
               
                  Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.
                  Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.

Extended description:

These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, ""GET /index.html HTTP/1.1"" is a structured message containing a command (""GET"") with a single argument (""/index.html"") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (""HTTP/1.1"").
            If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

A web application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site, and uses that link in a Redirect. This simplifies phishing attacks.

Extended description:
An http parameter may contain a URL value and could cause the web application to redirect the request to the specified URL. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts have a more trustworthy appearance. Whether this issue poses a vulnerability will be subject to the intended behavior of the application. For example, a search engine might intentionally provide redirects to arbitrary URLs.

The provided Python code is vulnerable to CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command), which is a type of OS command injection vulnerability. The `load` function takes a `doc` parameter and executes the code retrieved from `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`. If the content of the file `bs-extensions` is crafted by an attacker and contains malicious code, it can be executed by the `exec` function. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server where the application is running.

The `exec` function is particularly dangerous because it executes the code within the current global and local namespaces, which can lead to the execution of any Python code, including system commands if the attacker has control over the input. This is a clear example of CWE-7EE (Execute with Arbitrary Command), which is a specific instance of CWE-78.

In the context of the provided code, if the `bs-extensions` file contains something like `os.system('rm -rf /')`, it would be executed, leading to potentially catastrophic consequences.","

CWE description:
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

The provided code snippet for `validate_agent_data` function is vulnerable due to the way it handles JSON parsing and the potential for log spoofing. The vulnerability is not directly related to CWE-290 (Improper Input Handling) but rather to CWE-200 (Command Interpreter) or CWE-200-CWE-202 (OS Command Interpreter) if the input is used in a context where it could be executed or evaluated.

The issue arises from the fact that the code assumes `agent_data['allowlist']` is a string that can be directly passed to `json.loads()` without any prior validation or sanitization. If an attacker can control the content of `agent_data`, they could craft a payload that, when processed by `json.loads()`, leads to log spoofing or other unintended behavior.

For example, if `agent_data['allowlist']` contains a string that is not valid JSON or includes malicious content, the `json.loads()` function could raise an exception or behave unexpectedly. This could potentially be exploited to cause a denial of service or to execute arbitrary code, depending on how the exception is handled and the context in which the function is used.

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles the error message. The error message is directly included in the JSON response without proper escaping, which can lead to XSS attacks if the error message contains user-controlled data.

In the line `return HttpResponseForbidden(json.dumps({""error"": force_text(reason)}))`, the `reason` parameter is being directly included in the JSON response without proper escaping. If an attacker can control the `reason` parameter, they can inject malicious scripts that will be executed when the error message is displayed to the user.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the error message is properly escaped before being included in the JSON response. You can use the `escape` function from Django's `django.utils.html` module to escape the error message before including it in the JSON response.

Here's an updated version of the code that properly escapes the error message:

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The provided code for `swaggerui_static` is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a blind server-side request forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises because the function takes a filename as an input and uses it to construct a file path to serve a static file. If an attacker can control the filename, they could potentially craft a path that leads to a different file or even a different server, causing the server to retrieve data from an unintended location.

In the context of the CVE-ID CVE-2EE-50266, the vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-ID CVE-2023-50266, where the proxy method in Bazarr's app does not validate the user-controlled protocol and URL variables before passing them to `requests.get()`. This allows attackers to make the server send requests to internal or external resources on behalf of the server.

In the case of the `swaggerui_static` function, if an attacker can manipulate the `filename` parameter to include a path traversal sequence (e.g., `../../../../etc/passwd`), they could potentially access sensitive files on the server's file system. This could lead to information disclosure or other security breaches.

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-controlated input in the `test_custom_field_table_render` function. The `LocationTable` class is assumed to render custom fields, and the `bound_row.get_cell(internal_col_name)` method is used to retrieve the rendered value of a custom field. If the `LocationTable` class does not properly sanitize the input before rendering it to the web page, it could be vulnerable to XSS attacks.

The CVE-2023-48750 vulnerability description mentions that the vulnerability arises from improper handling of user-controlled input when rendering custom fields, buttons, links, and job codes. If the `LocationTable` class uses unsafe methods like `mark_safe` or `safe` to render the custom fields without proper sanitization, it could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the rendered output.

To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the `LocationTable` class properly sanitizes and escapes any user-controlled input before rendering it to the web page. This can be done by using the `escape` function from Django'EE's template system or by using the `format_html` function from Django's `utils` module. Additionally, it is essential to review the","

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.
