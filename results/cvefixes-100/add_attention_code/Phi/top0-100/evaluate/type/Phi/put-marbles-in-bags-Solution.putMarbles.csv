[{'lang': 'en', 'value': ""Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly.

The provided code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in CWE-9EE. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not validate or sanitize the input for the 'data' parameter, which is used to determine the type of books list to render. If an attacker can manipulate the 'data' parameter to point to an unexpected or malicious URL, the server might attempt to retrieve content from that URL, potentially bypassing access controls and exposing sensitive information or allowing the attacker to use the server as a proxy for other malicious activities.

To fix this vulnerability, you should validate the 'data' parameter against a whitelist of allowed values and ensure that it does not contain any unexpected URLs or commands that could lead to SSRF attacks. Additionally, you should implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent other types of injection attacks.","

To fix this vulnerability, you should validate the 'data' parameter against a whitelist of allowed values and ensure that it does not contain any unexpected URLs or commands that could lead to SSRF attacks. Additionally, you should implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent other types of injection attacks.","

The provided code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to the way it handles URLs or requests from an upstream component. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

In the code, the `render_read_books` function retrieves a URL or similar request from an upstream component and sends it to the `calibre_db.fill_indexpage` function. However, there is no validation or sanitization of the URL or request before it is sent. This means that an attacker could potentially provide a malicious URL or request that causes the server to send requests to unexpected hosts or ports.

For example, an attacker could provide a URL that points to a local network resource or a different server, bypassing access controls such as firewalls. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or resources on the server or the local network.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the URL or request before sending it to the `calibre_db.fill_indexpage` function. This could involve checking the URL against a whitelist of allowed hosts and ports, or using a library to parse and validate the URL to ensure it is well-formed and safe to use. Additionally, the server should implement","

The provided code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to the way it handles URLs or requests from upstream components. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

In the code, the `render_read_books` function retrieves a URL or similar request from an upstream component and does not validate or sanitize the input before using it. This can allow an attacker to provide unexpected hosts or ports, potentially bypassing access controls such as firewalls.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the input before using it to make requests. This can be done by implementing proper input validation and whitelisting of allowed hosts and ports. Additionally, the code should ensure that the requests are made to the expected destination by verifying the URL or request before processing it.

Here's an example of how you can validate and sanitize the input:

```python
import re

def validate_url(url):
    # Whitelist of allowed hosts and ports
    allowed_hosts = [""example.com"", ""api.example.com""]
    allowed_ports = [80, 443]

    # Validate the URL using regular expressions

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `test_security_check` function handles the `bad_url` and `good_url` parameters when constructing the `nasty_url` and `safe_url`. The `urlquote` function is used to URL-encode the `bad_url` and `good_url`, but this is not sufficient to prevent XSS attacks.

The issue is that the `urlquote` function only encodes the URL components, but it does not escape or sanitize the input to prevent the execution of malicious scripts. An attacker can craft a malicious URL that includes JavaScript code, which, when included in the `nasty_url` or `safe_url`, can be executed by the web browser of a victim who accesses the generated URL.

For example, an attacker could provide a `bad_url` like `http://example.com/script.js?<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When this URL is URL-encoded and included in the `nasty_url`, the resulting URL would still contain the malicious script, which could be executed by the victim's browser.

To fix this vulnerability, the `urlquote` function should be replaced with a more robust method of sanitizing and esc","

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

CWE description:
The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Extended description:

            Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:

               Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and

            When any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.
            There are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:
               
                  Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.
                  Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.

The provided Python code is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a type of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles the `recipe.link` URL. The code replaces 'www.dropbox.' with 'dl.dropboxusercontent.' in the URL before making the request. This replacement is not based on any validation or sanitization of the input, which means an attacker could potentially manipulate the URL to point to an internal or sensitive resource on the server or another server that the application has access to.

For example, an attacker could craft a URL that points to an internal file or service by replacing 'www.dropbox.' with a different subdomain or hostname that the server is allowed to access. Since the code does not validate or whitelist the URLs, it could be used to bypass access controls and access sensitive information.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate the URLs before making the request, ensuring that they only point to allowed domains and do not contain unexpected hosts or ports. Additionally, implementing proper input validation and sanitization techniques can help prevent SSRF attacks.","

Extended description:

            Improper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.

These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, ""GET /index.html HTTP/1.1"" is a structured message containing a command (""GET"") with a single argument (""/index.html"") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (""HTTP/1.1"").
            If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

The provided Python code is vulnerable because it uses the `exec` function to execute code retrieved from an external source. This is a classic example of a code injection vulnerability, which is indeed related to CWE-22 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Input). The `exec` function executes the string passed to it as Python code, which means if an attacker can control the content of `code`, they could execute arbitrary code on the system where this function is running.

The vulnerability is not directly related to path traversal (CWE-22), but it is a similar concept where external input is used without proper validation or sanitization, leading to potential security issues. In this case, the external input is the code to be executed, not a file path. However, the principle of not trusting external input and the need for proper handling to prevent security vulnerabilities is consistent across both types of issues.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should avoid using `exec` with external input. If you need to execute dynamic code, consider using safer alternatives like `eval` with limited scope or a sandboxed execution environment. Additionally, ensure that the source of the external code is trusted and that the code is properly validated and sanitized before execution.","

FastAPI versions lower than 0.65.2 that used cookies for authentication in path operations that received JSON payloads sent by browsers were vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. In versions lower than 0.65.2, FastAPI would try to read the request payload as JSON even if the content-type header sent was not set to application/json or a compatible JSON media type (e.g. application/geo+json).

The browser will execute them right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application. This is fixed in FastAPI 0.65.2. The request data is now parsed as JSON only if the content-type header is application/json or another JSON compatible media type like application/geo+json.

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-controlled input in the `test_custom_field_table_render` function. The `LocationTable` class is being initialized with a queryset that filters `Location` objects based on the `name` attribute, which could be user-controlled input. If the `LocationTable` class does not properly sanitize or escape this input before rendering it in the web page, it could lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

The `bound_row.get_cell(internal_col_name)` method is used to retrieve the value of a custom field column, which could potentially contain user-controlled input. If this value is not properly escaped or sanitized before being rendered in the web page, it could lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `LocationTable` class properly sanitizes or escapes user-controlled input before rendering it in the web page. This can be done by using Django's built-right template system, which automatically escapes user-controlled input to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

Additionally, you should review the `LocationTable` class and its methods to ensure that they handle user-controlled input in a secure manner. This may involve using Django's built-in template system or other libraries","

[{'lang': 'en', 'value': ""Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform built as a web application All users of Nautobot versions earlier than 1.6.6 or 2.0.5 are potentially affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability. Due to incorrect usage of Django's `mark_safe()` API when rendering certain types of user-authored content; including custom links, job buttons, and computed fields; it is possible that users with permission to create or edit these types of content could craft a malicious payload (such as JavaScript code) that would be executed when rendering pages containing this content. The maintainers have fixed the incorrect uses of `mark_safe()` (generally by replacing them with appropriate use of `format_html()` instead) to prevent such malicious data from being executed. Users on Nautobot 1.6.x LTM should upgrade to v1.6.6 and users on Nautobot 2.0.x should upgrade to v2.0.5. Appropriate object permissions can and should be applied to restrict which users are permitted to create or edit the aforementioned types of user-authored content. Other than that, there is no direct workaround available.""}]

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The provided code snippet for `convert_bookformat` does not exhibit the vulnerability described by CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery). The function takes `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` as input from the request form and does not directly handle or process URLs or network requests that could be manipulated by an attacker to cause SSRF. The vulnerability would be more likely to occur if the function were to use these inputs to make a network request to an external service without proper validation or if it were to pass them to another component that does so. However, based on the given code, there is no indication of such behavior.","

The provided code snippet for `convert_bookformat` does not exhibit the vulnerability described by CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery). The function takes `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` as input from the request form, which are then used in a call to `helper.convert_book_format`. There is no evidence in the code that it is directly handling or processing URLs or requests to external services without proper validation or sanitization.

However, it is important to note that without seeing the implementation of `helper.convert_right_book_format` and how it interacts with external services or resources, we cannot definitively conclude that there is no vulnerability. The code provided does not show any direct handling of URLs or external requests that could lead to SSRF vulnerabilities.","
