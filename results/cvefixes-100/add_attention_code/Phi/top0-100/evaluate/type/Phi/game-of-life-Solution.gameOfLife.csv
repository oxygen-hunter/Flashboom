The provided code snippet for the `get_response` function does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server Side Request Forgery) as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2021-43780 for Redash. The vulnerability in Redash was related to the handling of URL-loading data sources, which could be exploited to bypass access controls.

In the provided `get_response` function, there is no direct handling of URLs or data sources that would allow for server-side request forgery. The function simply makes an HTTP request using the `requests` library and handles the response. The vulnerability in Redash was specifically related to the use of the `requests` library in a certain way, which is not present in the provided code.

However, it is important to note that without the full context of the application and how this function is used, it is not possible to definitively say that there are no other vulnerabilities present. It is always recommended to follow best practices for secure coding and to keep dependencies up to date to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.","

[{'lang': 'en', 'value': ""Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly.

The provided code for the `extend_search_term` function does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described by CWE-918. The function processes and extends a search term based on various parameters, but it does not involve any network operations or handling of external requests that could be manipulated by an attacker.

The function operates on local data and does not interact with any external services or resources that could be used to perform SSRF attacks. It simply manipulates strings and database queries within the context of the application.

However, it's important to note that without the full context of how the `calibre_db.session.query` and `calibre_db.speaking_language` functions are implemented, it's not possible to definitively rule out all potential vulnerabilities. If these functions involve network operations or interact with external resources, they could potentially introduce SSRF vulnerabilities. But based on the provided code snippet alone, there is no indication of such behavior.","

The provided code for `extend_search_term` does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described by CWE-918. The function processes input parameters to construct a search term for a query, but it does not involve any network operations or handling of external requests that could be manipulated by an attacker.

The code does not make any network requests, nor does it use any input to construct URLs or interact with external services. It simply processes the input parameters to build a search term string, which is then used within the application's context. There is no evidence of the code using input to make outbound requests or interact with external systems in a way that could be exploited for SSRF.

However, it is important to note that without the full context of how the `extend_search_term` function is used within the application, it is not possible to definitively rule out all potential vulnerabilities. It is always recommended to follow secure coding practices and perform thorough security reviews and testing to ensure the application is secure.","

The provided `gameOfLife` function is a correct implementation of the Game of Life algorithm, which is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway. The function modifies the input `board` in-place according to the rules of the Game of Life. It is not vulnerable in the context of the algorithm's logic.

However, if we consider the security aspect in a broader sense, the function itself does not have any direct security vulnerabilities. It is a simple algorithm that iterates over a 2D list and applies the Game of Life rules.

But, if this function is part of a larger application, there could be potential security concerns related to how the `board` is managed, such as:

1. If the `board` is being populated with user-supplied data, there could be a risk of injection attacks if the data is not properly validated and sanitized.
2. If the `board` is being stored or transmitted, there could be concerns about data privacy and integrity.

In summary, the `gameOfLife` function itself is not vulnerable, but its usage within a larger application could introduce security concerns depending on how the `board` is handled.","

The provided code for `render_books_list` does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described by CWE-918. The function takes parameters and uses them to call other functions that render different types of book lists. There is no evidence of the function processing or executing external URLs or requests based on the input parameters. The code does not interact with any external services or resources based on the input parameters, which would be necessary for an SSRF vulnerability to exist.

However, it's important to note that without the full context of the application and the implementation details of the functions like `get_sort_function`, `render_rated_books`, `render_discover_books`, etc., it's not possible to definitively say that there are no vulnerabilities at all.

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `test_security_check` function constructs the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` using string formatting with user-controlled input (`bad_url` and `good_url`). The `urlquote` function is used to escape the URLs, but it may not be sufficient to prevent XSS if the URLs contain JavaScript or other executable code.

The vulnerability is due to the fact that the code does not properly neutralize or sanitize the user-controlled input before using it in the URL. An attacker could craft a malicious URL that, when used in the `nasty_url` or `safe_url`, could lead to XSS attacks when the URL is later used in the web application.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a more robust method to sanitize and validate the user-controlled input before using it in the URL. This could involve using a whitelist approach to only allow specific, known-safe URLs, or using a more comprehensive sanitization library that can handle a wider range of potential XSS payloads.","

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The provided code for the _delete_user function does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CWE-918 and CVE-2022-0339. The function is designed to delete a user from a database based on certain conditions, and it does not involve any URL or request handling that could be manipulated for SSRF attacks.

The function checks if the user has the role of an admin and is not a ""Guest"" user. If these conditions are met, it proceeds to delete various related records from the database. The deletion process is done using SQL queries and does not involve any external requests or URLs.

However, it is essential to ensure that the input (content.id) is properly validated and sanitized to prevent other types of vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection. The code provided does not show any direct handling of user input, so it is not possible to assess the risk of SQL injection in this context.

In summary, based on the provided code snippet, there is no indication of SSRF vulnerability, but it is always recommended to follow best practices for input validation and sanitization to prevent other potential security issues.","

Extended description:

            Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:

               Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and

            When any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.

                  Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.
                  Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.

The vulnerability arises from the way the `prepare_plugin_docs_command` function constructs the `cmdline_args` list by appending elements that include user-supplied values such as `plugin_names`, `plugin_type`, `playbook_dir`, and `module_path`. If these values contain shell metacharacters or commands, they could be executed unintentionally when the `command` list is used to run a system command.

For example, if `plugin_names` contains a string like `validPluginName; rm -rf /`, the resulting command would be executed as `ansible-doc-exec -j -s -t validPluginName -M rm -rf /`, which could lead to the deletion of files if the user running the script has sufficient permissions.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should sanitize and validate all user-supplied inputs before using them to construct system commands. This can be done by escaping special characters, using allowlists for acceptable values, or using safer methods to execute system commands that do not involve constructing command strings from user input.","

CWE description:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

Extended description:

            Improper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.
            Most products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, ""GET /index.html HTTP/1.1"" is a structured message containing a command (""GET"") with a single argument (""/index.html"") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (""HTTP/1.1"").
            If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

CWE description:
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

The provided Python code is vulnerable due to the use of the `exec` function, which executes the code passed to it as a string. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if an attacker is able to control the input to the `load` function, specifically the `doc` parameter. Since the `load` function retrieves and executes code from a file based on the `doc` parameter, an attacker could potentially supply a malicious `doc` value that leads to the execution of harmful code.

This vulnerability is related to CWE-22 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in OGNCP Parameters), as the `load` function does not properly neutralize or validate the input used to construct the file path for the `retrieveBoilerplateFile` function. An attacker could exploit this by manipulating the `doc` parameter to include special characters or sequences that lead to the execution of unintended code.

The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The provided Python code is vulnerable to CWE-22, Path Traversal, because it uses external input (the `filename` parameter) to construct a file path without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially supply a string that navigates up the directory tree (using ""../"") or specifies an absolute path to access files outside the intended directory. This could lead to unauthorized access to the file system.","

The provided Python code for the `swaggerui_static` function is vulnerable to CWE-22, which is Path Traversal. The vulnerability arises because the function takes a `filename` parameter from the user and directly uses it to construct a file path without validating or sanitizing the input. An attacker could exploit this by providing a specially crafted filename that includes path traversal sequences like ""../"" to access files outside of the intended directory.

For example, if an attacker provides a filename like ""../../../../etc/passwd"", the function could potentially read the contents of the system's password file, leading to a serious security breach.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the `filename` parameter to ensure it does not contain any path traversal sequences or other unexpected characters before using it to construct the file path. Additionally, it would be safer to use a whitelist approach, where only specific, allowed filenames are accessible, rather than relying on user input to determine the file path.","

95,CWE-79," YES

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-controlled input in the `test_custom_field_table_render` function. The vulnerability arises from the use of Django's `mark_safe()` API incorrectly when rendering certain types of user-authored content, such as custom links, job buttons, and computed fields. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are executed when rendering pages containing this content.

In the code snippet, the `custom_column_expected` dictionary contains values that are HTML-formatted strings, which are then compared to the rendered values in the `bound_row.get_cell(internal_col_name)` call. If an attacker can manipulate the content of these fields, they could inject malicious scripts that would be executed when the page is rendered.

To fix this vulnerability, the developer should ensure that any user-controlled input is properly sanitized and escaped before being rendered in the web page. This can be achieved by using Django's built-in template system, which automatically escapes any unsafe characters in the content. Additionally, the developer should review the use of `mark_safe()` and replace it with appropriate escaping methods to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.","

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.
