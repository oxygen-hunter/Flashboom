The provided Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server Side Request Forgery) as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2021-43780. The code snippet is a generic function for making HTTP requests and does not directly handle or process URLs in a way that would allow an attacker to bypass access controls or use the server as a proxy for unauthorized requests.

The vulnerability described in CVE-2021-43780 is specific to Redash and its handling of URL-loading data sources. The provided code does not include any functionality related to Redash or similar data visualization and sharing packages. It is a generic function that could be used in various contexts, and without additional context or usage, it cannot be determined if it is vulnerable to the specific CWE-918 issue mentioned.

However, it is essential to note that the provided code does not include any input validation or sanitization for the `url` parameter, which could potentially lead to other types of vulnerabilities if the `url` is not properly validated before being used in the `requests_session.request` method. It is always recommended to validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent potential security issues.","

[{'lang': 'en', 'value': ""Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly.

The provided code snippet does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described by CWE-918. The code is a function that constructs a search term based on various parameters, including tags, ratings, and read status. It does not involve any network operations or handling of external requests that could be manipulated by an attacker to cause SSRF.

The original code you provided is a function that extends a search term with various filters and conditions. It does not involve any network operations or handling of external requests that could be manipulated by an attacker to cause SSRF. The function is focused on manipulating strings and database queries, which are not directly related to SSRF vulnerabilities.

However, it's important to note that without the full context of how this function is used within the application, it's not possible to definitively rule out all potential security issues. But based on the provided code snippet alone, there is no evidence of SSRF vulnerability.","

The provided code for the `list_books` function does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) based on the given description of the vulnerability. The code is a simple query to a database and does not involve any external requests or handling of user input in a way that could be used to construct a request to an unintended server.

However, it is important to note that without the full context of how the `calibre_db.search_query` and `calibre_db.get_search_results` functions work, it is not possible to definitively say that there are no vulnerabilities. If these functions do make external requests or handle user input in a way that could be manipulated to cause SSRF, then the vulnerability would be in those functions, not in the `list_books` function itself.

To ensure the application is secure, you should review the implementation of `calibre_db.search_query` and `calibre_db.get_search_results` to make sure they properly validate and sanitize any user input and do not make any unintended external requests.","

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to CWE-918, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2022-0939. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not validate or sanitize the input for the `data` parameter, which is used to determine the type of books list to render. If an attacker can manipulate the `data` parameter to point to an unexpected or malicious URL, the server might attempt to retrieve content from that URL, potentially leading to SSRF attacks.

For example, if an attacker can control the `data` parameter and set it to a URL that points to a different server or service, the server might send a request to that URL, which could lead to unauthorized access to internal resources or services. This could bypass firewalls or other access controls, allowing the attacker to exploit the server or access sensitive information.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate the `data` parameter against a whitelist of allowed values or sanitize the input to ensure it only contains valid characters and patterns. Additionally, the server should implement proper access controls and network security measures to prevent unauthorized access to internal resources.","

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not validate or sanitize the input for the `data` parameter, which is used to determine the type of books to render. If an attacker can manipulate the `data` parameter to point to an unexpected or malicious URL, the server might attempt to retrieve content from that URL, potentially bypassing access controls and exposing sensitive information or allowing the attacker to use the server as a proxy for their own malicious activities.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate the `data` parameter against a whitelist of allowed values before using it to determine the type of books to render. Additionally, any URLs or external resources retrieved by the server should be properly validated and sanitized to prevent SSRF attacks.","

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-918, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), because it does not validate or sanitize the URLs or requests it retrieves from the upstream component. The code uses the `calibre_db.fill_indexpage` function to retrieve data, but there is no indication that it checks the validity or safety of the URLs or requests it processes. If an attacker can influence the input to this function, they could potentially cause the server to make requests to unintended destinations, bypassing access controls or using other protocols to access sensitive information.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize any URLs or requests it processes, ensuring that they are intended for the expected destination and do not expose sensitive information or allow unauthorized access.","

The provided code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CWE-ID CWE-918. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not validate or sanitize the URLs or requests it retrieves from the upstream component. If an attacker can manipulate the URL or request that the server retrieves, they could potentially make the server send requests to unintended destinations.

In the code, the `calibre_db.fill_indexpage` function is called with `sort_param` as an argument, which is derived from the `order` parameter. If an attacker can control the `order` parameter, they could potentially craft a malicious URL or request that the server would retrieve and process.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the `sort_param` (or any other input that could lead to external requests) to ensure that it only contains expected and safe values. Additionally, the server should not blindly trust the upstream component and should implement proper access controls and network security measures to prevent unauthorized access to internal resources.","

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, specifically Type 1 (Reflected XSS). The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles user-controlled input (the `bad_url` and `good_url` variables) and reflects it back in the HTTP response without proper sanitization or encoding.

In the `test_security_check` function, the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` variables are constructed by concatenating user-controlled input (`bad_url` and `good_url`) with other parts of the URL. This user-controlled input is then used in the `self.client.post` method, which simulates a POST request to the server.

If the `is_safe_url` function in `utils.py` does not properly sanitize or encode the user-controlled input before using it in the URL, an attacker could inject malicious scripts into the URL. When the server reflects this URL back in the HTTP response, the malicious script could be executed by the victim's browser, leading to an XSS attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the `is_safe_url` function should be updated to properly sanitize and encode user-controlled input before using it in the URL. Additionally, the `test_security_check","

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

CWE description:
The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Extended description:

            Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:

            When any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.
            There are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:
               
                  Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.
                  Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-918, Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the way the code modifies the `recipe.link` URL before making the HTTP GET request. By replacing 'www.dropbox.' with 'dl.dropboxusercontent.', the code potentially allows an attacker to manipulate the URL to point to an internal or unintended destination.

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it constructs the command line arguments for execution. Specifically, the issue arises from the concatenation of user-supplied input (`plugin_names`) directly into the command line without proper escaping or validation. This can lead to command injection vulnerabilities, where an attacker could supply specially crafted input to execute arbitrary commands on the host system.

In the `prepare_plugin_docs_command` function, the `plugin_names` list is joined into a single string and appended to the `cmdline_args` list, which is then used to construct the final command to be executed. If an attacker can control the contents of `plugin_names`, they could potentially inject additional commands or arguments that would be executed by the system.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to properly escape or sanitize the user-supplied input before using it in the command line. Additionally, using higher-level APIs that abstract away the need to construct command lines directly can help prevent such vulnerabilities.","

CWE description:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

Extended description:

            Improper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.
            Most products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, ""GET /index.html HTTP/1.1"" is a structured message containing a command (""GET"") with a single argument (""/index.html"") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (""HTTP/1.1"").
            If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have.

Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

FastAPI versions lower than 0.65.2 that used cookies for authentication in path operations that received JSON payloads sent by browsers were vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. In versions lower than 0.65.2, FastAPI would try to read the request payload as JSON even if the content-type header sent was not set to application/json or a compatible JSON media type (e.g. application/geo+json). A request with a content type of text/plain containing JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data would be extracted. Requests with content type text/plain are exempt from CORS preflights, for being considered Simple requests. The browser will execute them right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application. This is fixed in FastAPI 0.65.2. The request data is now parsed as JSON only if the content-type header is application/json or another JSON compatible media type like application/geo+json.

The provided Python code is vulnerable to CWE-444, which is related to HTTP smuggling attacks. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `smuggle_url` function, which is not shown in the code snippet but is implied to be used for setting HTTP headers. If `smuggle_url` does not properly sanitize or validate the input it receives, it could be exploited to smuggle malicious HTTP requests through the intermediary (in this case, the parsing function `_parse_video`).

The CWE-444 description indicates that an intermediary HTTP agent (like a proxy or firewall) may not consistently interpret malformed HTTP requests or responses. If the `smuggle_url` function allows for the inclusion of malformed headers or other unexpected input, it could lead to inconsistent parsing and interpretation of messages. This could allow an attacker to bypass security controls or perform actions on behalf of the user without the intermediary being aware.

To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure that `smuggle_url` properly validates and sanitizes all input, and that it is consistent with how the ultimate destination (the server) would interpret the HTTP headers. Additionally, it is important to keep all dependencies, such as `yt-dlp` if it is being used, up to date to include any security","

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-controlled input in the `LocationTable` rendering process. The vulnerability arises from the use of Django's `mark_safe()` function, which is not shown in the code snippet but is mentioned in the CVE description.

The `mark_safe()` function is used to mark a string as safe for HTML output, meaning that it will not be escaped by Django's template engine. If the `LocationTable` class or any other part of the rendering process uses `mark_safe()` to render user-controlled input without proper sanitization, it could lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

In the code snippet, the `custom_column_expected` dictionary contains values that are rendered as HTML elements, such as `<span>`, `<i>`, and `<a>`. If these values are directly inserted into the HTML output without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious scripts into the rendered output.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that all user-controlled input is properly sanitized before being rendered in the HTML output. This can be achieved by using Django's built-in template filters, such as `escape()` or `format_html()`, to sanitize the input and prevent XSS attacks. Additionally, you should review the `LocationTable","

               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

Extended description:
By providing URLs to unexpected hosts or ports, attackers can make it appear that the server is sending the request, possibly bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly. The server can be used as a proxy to conduct port scanning of hosts in internal networks, use other URLs such as that can access documents on the system (using file://), or use other protocols such as gopher:// or tftp://, which may provide greater control over the contents of requests.
