The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CWE-918 issue described. The code is a function that retries to a URL and handles the response, but it does not involve URL-based data retrieval or processing that could be exploited through advanced server-side request forgery (ASRF). The vulnerability described in CWE-918 specifically pertains to the misuse of URL-based data retrieval, which is not evident in the given code snippet.","

[{'lang': 'en', 'value': ""Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly.

The provided code for the `handleQuery` function does not exhibit any clear vulnerabilities related to security issues such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or server-side request forgery (SSRF). It is a Python function that uses a segment tree data structure to perform range queries and updates on an array. The function is designed to handle a series of queries on two arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, and it does not interact with any external systems or databases that could be exploited.

However, it is important to note that without the full context of how the function is used within the application, it is not possible to definitively say that there are no vulnerabilities. For example, if the function is part of a web application and the input data (`nums1`, `nums2`, and `queries`) is provided by users, there could be potential risks if the input is not properly validated and sanitized. But based on the provided code snippet alone, there are no direct security vulnerabilities.","

The provided code for the `handleQuery` function does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The function is designed to handle a series of queries on two lists of integers, `nums1` and `nums2`, using a segment tree data structure for efficient updates and queries.

The segment tree is used to perform range updates and queries on the `nums1` list, while the `nums2` list is used to accumulate the results of the queries. The function does not involve any network communication or external resource access that could be exploited by an attacker to perform SSRF.

However, it is essential to note that the security of the code depends on the context in which it is used and the overall application design. If the function is part of a larger application that interacts with external resources or performs network operations, it is crucial to ensure that proper security measures are in place to prevent SSRF and other vulnerabilities.","

The provided code is vulnerable to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not validate or sanitize the input `book_id` before using it to query the database. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `book_id` to cause the server to make unauthorized requests to internal or external resources.

For example, an attacker could craft a `book_id` that, when processed by the `calibre_db.get_book_read_archived` function, leads to a request being sent to an internal or external server. This could be done by embedding a URL or other network resource within the `book_id` value. If the server then uses this `book_id` to make a request to an external service without proper validation, it could be tricked into accessing or interacting with unintended resources.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate the `book_id` to ensure it is a legitimate and expected value before using it in database queries or other operations that involve making network requests. Additionally, implementing proper input validation and sanitization techniques can help prevent SSRF attacks.","

The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles string inputs without properly sanitizing or escaping them. Specifically, the `__setitem__` method in the code snippet provided does not check for or handle CRLF sequences in the input values. This can lead to CRLF injection attacks when the values are used in a context where they are interpreted as control characters, such as in HTTP headers or SQL queries.

In the context of the provided code, if the `value` being set in the dictionary is later used in a context where it is interpreted as a control sequence (e.g., in a web application where it might be part of a URL or HTTP header), an attacker could exploit this by providing a value that includes a CRLF sequence. This could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities such as HTTP response splitting or other types of injection attacks.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to sanitize and escape all user-supplied input that will be used in a context where it could be interpreted as control characters.

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `test_security_check` function handles the `bad_url` and `good_url` parameters when constructing the `nasty_url` and `safe_url`. The `urlquote` function is used to escape the URLs, but it does not prevent the injection of malicious scripts if the input is not properly sanitized before being included in the URL.

In the `test_security_check` function, the `bad_url` and `good_url` parameters are hardcoded in the test cases. However, in a real-world scenario, these parameters could be provided by users or other sources that may not be trustworthy. If an attacker can control the input for these parameters, they could inject malicious scripts that would be executed when the constructed URLs are accessed.

For example, an attacker could provide a `bad_url` like `http://example.com/script.js?action=alert('XSS')`. If this URL is not properly sanitized and is included in the `nasty_url`, it could lead to an XSS attack when the URL is accessed.

               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The provided code is vulnerable because it uses the `exec` function to execute code that is retrieved from an external source (`config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`). This means that if an attacker can control the content of the file being read by `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile`, they could inject malicious code that would be executed by the `exec` function. This is a classic example of an OS command injection vulnerability, where an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system.

In the context of the provided code, if the `bs-extensions` file contains code that is not properly sanitized and is directly executed by `exec`, it could lead to the execution of unintended commands. This is especially dangerous if the application running this code has higher privileges, as it could lead to a privilege escalation attack.

To fix this vulnerability, you should avoid using `exec` to execute code from untrusted sources.

The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles error messages. The error message is directly taken from the `reason` parameter and encoded with `json.dumps` and `force_text`. If an attacker can control the `reason` parameter, they could inject malicious scripts into the error message.

Here's the vulnerable part of the code:

```python
return HttpResponseForbidden(json.dumps({""error"": force_text(reason)}))
```

To fix this vulnerability, you should sanitize the `reason` parameter before using it in the response. You can use a library like `bleach` to clean the input and remove any potentially harmful scripts.

Here's an example of how you can sanitize the `reason` parameter:

```python
import bleach

def _get_unauth_response(self, request, reason):
    # Sanitize the reason parameter
    sanitized_reason = bleach.clean(reason)

    if request.is_ajax():

The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The provided code for `backup_download` is vulnerable to CWE-22, which is an Improper Input Handling issue. Specifically, it is susceptible to Path Traversal attacks, as described by CWE-22. The vulnerability arises because the function takes a `filename` parameter, which is used to construct a file path by joining it with a base directory path. If an attacker can control the `filename` input, they could potentially include special path elements like ""../"" to navigate to directories outside the intended `settings.backup.folder`.

This could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files on the server that the application has access to, leading to information disclosure and potentially other security issues. The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-ID CVE-2023-50264, where an application did not properly neutralize special elements in a file path, leading to an arbitrary file read vulnerability.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should sanitize the `filename` input to ensure that it does not contain any path traversal sequences or other malicious content.

The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The provided Python code for the `add_objects` function does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in CVE-2022-0939. The function is designed to add objects to a database session based on certain conditions and does not involve processing or handling external URLs or network requests. It operates on internal data structures and does not interact with external services or protocols that could be exploited for SSRF attacks.

The second code snippet, `handleQuery`, is a function that operates on lists of integers and queries, and it uses a segment tree data structure for efficient querying and updating. This function also does not involve any network operations or URL handling that could be susceptible to SSRF vulnerabilities.

Therefore, based on the provided code and the context of the functions, there is no indication of SSRF vulnerability in either of the code snippets.","

CWE description:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

Extended description:
By providing URLs to unexpected hosts or ports, attackers can make it appear that the server is sending the request, possibly bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly. The server can be used as a proxy to conduct port scanning of hosts in internal networks, use other URLs such as that can access documents on the system (using file://), or use other protocols such as gopher:// or tftp://, which may provide greater control over the contents of requests.
