[{'lang': 'en', 'value': ""Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly.

The provided Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CWE-601 issue described. The code is for creating a new worker Home Server (HS) instance in a Matrix reference homeserver environment, and it does not involve user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site for redirection. The code is focused on setting up the server configuration, handling TCP replication, and managing resources for the worker HS.

An http parameter may contain a URL value and could cause the web application to redirect the request to the specified URL. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts have a more trustworthy appearance.

The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CWE-307-SQL-Injection vulnerability. The code uses parameterized queries with the `filter` method of SQLAlchemy, which helps prevent SQL injection by separating the SQL code from the data. The `search` and `sort_param` parameters are used in a way that does not directly interpolate user input into SQL statements.

However, it is essential to ensure that the `search` parameter is properly sanitized and validated before being used in the `calibre_db.search_query` method. If the `search` parameter is not properly handled, it could potentially lead to other vulnerabilities.

In general, it is always a good practice to follow secure coding practices and use parameterized queries or ORM methods to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.","

The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CWE-263 SQL injection vulnerability. The code uses parameterized queries and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) methods provided by SQLAlchemy, which are designed to prevent SQL injection by separating the SQL code from the data being inputted.

In the code, the `request.args.get()` method is used to retrieve query parameters, and these parameters are then passed to the ORM methods like `calibre_db.search_query()` and `calibre_db.get_search_results()`. These methods are responsible for constructing the SQL queries using the provided parameters.

The `calibre_db.common_filters()` method is also used, which likely contains the necessary SQLAlchemy filters to prevent SQL injection.

However, it is essential to ensure that the `calibre_db.search_query()` and `calibre_db.get_search_results()` methods are implemented correctly to avoid SQL injection vulnerabilities. If these methods use raw SQL queries or concatenate user input directly into the query, then the code could be vulnerable.

In summary, based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of a CWE-2EE SQL injection vulnerability. However, it is crucial to review the implementation of the `calibre_db.search_","

The code does not include any functionality to retrieve or process URLs or requests from upstream components. It is a login function that handles user authentication and does not involve any network requests or interactions with external services based on user input.

The code uses LDAP for authentication and has a fallback mechanism for local password verification. It also includes a password reset feature. However, none of these functionalities involve processing or handling user-supplied URLs or requests, which would be necessary for an SSRF vulnerability to exist.

The provided code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in CWE-918. The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles URLs or requests from upstream components without ensuring that the requests are being sent to the expected destination.

In the code, the `render_hot_books` function retrieves data from the `ub.Downloads` table and orders it by the count of downloads. However, the code does not validate or sanitize the input for the `order` parameter. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `order` parameter to include a malicious URL or request that the server would then process.

For example, an attacker could craft a request with an `order` parameter that includes a URL to an internal or sensitive resource on the server or its network. If the server does not properly validate or sanitize this input, it could inadvertently retrieve and display the contents of that resource, leading to information disclosure or other security issues.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the `order` parameter to ensure that it only contains valid sorting options and does not include any malicious URLs or requests. Additionally, the server should implement proper access controls and network segmentation to prevent unautarded access to internal resources.","

51,CWE-918," YES, the provided Python code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in CWE-918.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `calibre_db.fill_indexpage` function, which retrieves the contents of URLs without sufficient validation. The function is called with the `db_filter` parameter, which is constructed using the `config.config_read_column` value. If an attacker can manipulate the `config.config_read_column` value, they can potentially make the server retrieve content from arbitrary URLs.

For example, an attacker could set `config.config_read_column` to a malicious URL, and the server would attempt to retrieve content from that URL. This could lead to various security issues, such as bypassing access controls, accessing sensitive information, or using the server as a proxy for other attacks.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `config.config_read_column` value is properly validated and sanitized before using it in the `db_filter` construction. Additionally, you should avoid using untrusted input to construct URLs that the server will retrieve.","

The vulnerability in question involves the web server improperly handling or validating URLs or requests, potentially allowing an attacker to make the server send requests to unintended destinations.

However, the code snippet you've shared is a Python function that queries a database and renders a template based on user permissions and preferences. It does not involve any URL handling or request processing that could be exploited for SSRF.

The vulnerability you've mentioned (CWE-918) typically occurs when a web application takes a user-supplied URL and uses it to make a request to a third-party service without proper validation or sanitization. This can lead to various attacks, including bypassing access controls, leaking sensitive information, or even using the server as a proxy for malicious activities.

In the context of the provided code, there is no evidence of such behavior. The function `series_list` does not accept or process any external URLs or requests that could be manipulated by an attacker. It simply queries a database and renders a template based on the results.

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, specifically Type 1 (Reflected XSS). The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles user-controlled input (the `bad_url` and `good_url` variables) and reflects it back in the HTTP response without proper sanitization or encoding.

In the `test_security_check` function, the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` variables are constructed by concatenating user-controlled input (`bad_url` and `good_url`) with other parts of the URL. This user-controlled input is then used in the `self.client.post` method, which simulates a POST request to the server.

If an attacker can manipulate the `bad_url` or `good_url` variables to include malicious JavaScript code, the server will reflect this code back in the HTTP response. When the victim's browser receives this response, it will execute the malicious script, leading to a potential XSS attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly sanitize and encode the user-controlled input before using it in the URL construction. This can be achieved by using a library or function that escapes or encodes special characters in the input, such as HTML escape sequences or URL encoding.

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

                  Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.
                  Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.

The provided Python code is vulnerable due to the way it constructs the command line arguments for execution. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the concatenation of user-supplied input (`plugin_names`) directly into the command line without proper escaping or validation. This can lead to command injection attacks if an attacker provides specially crafted input.

In the `prepare_plugin_docs_command` function, the `plugin_names` parameter is expected to be a list of plugin names. The function then joins the elements of this list into a single string with spaces in between and appends it to the `cmdline_args` list. This string is then used to construct the final command that is executed.

If an attacker can control the contents of `plugin_names`, they could potentially inject additional shell commands or manipulate the intended command to execute arbitrary commands on the host system. For example, an attacker could provide a string like `valid_plugin_name; rm -rf /` as an element in the `plugin_names` list, which would result in the execution of the `rm -rf /` command after the intended command, potentially leading to catastrophic consequences.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the `plugin_names` input to ensure that it only contains valid plugin names and does not contain any shell metacharacters or command","

The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

Extended description:

            Improper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.
            Most products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, ""GET /index.html HTTP/1.1"" is a structured message containing a command (""GET"") with a single argument (""/index.html"") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (""HTTP/1.1"").
            If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it handles authentication tokens. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the code does not properly validate the expiration of the token. This can lead to a situation where a user with a disabled account can still use an old token to gain access, as the code does not check if the token has expired or not.

The code also does to check if the token has been revoked or not, which can lead to unauthorized access if the token has been compromised.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should be updated to include proper token expiration and revocation checks. This can be done by adding a timestamp to the token and checking if the token has expired before allowing access. Additionally, the code should also check if the token has been revoked before allowing access.

The provided Python code is vulnerable because it uses the `exec()` function to execute code that is retrieved from an external source (`config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`). This means that if an attacker can control the content of the file being loaded, they could inject malicious code that would be executed by the `exec()` function.

CWE description:
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

86,CWE-835," YES

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to CWE-835, which is an infinite loop condition. The vulnerability arises from the way the loop is constructed and how the buffer is being consumed.

In the `data_right` function, the loop condition is `while self._buffer:` which means that the loop will continue as long as `self._buffer` is not empty. However, the code does not guarantee that `self._buffer` will be emptied in every iteration. If the incoming data is not properly consumed or if the `header_from_binary` function does not consume the entire buffer, the loop will continue indefinitely, leading to an infinite loop.

This can be exploited by an attacker by sending malformed packets that cause the `header_from_binary` function to not consume the entire buffer, or by sending data that never satisfies the condition to exit the loop. This will result in the server consuming excessive resources, such as CPU or memory, and potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the loop condition is properly updated and that the buffer is being consumed correctly in each iteration. Additionally, you should handle any exceptions or errors that may occur during the parsing of the incoming data to prevent the loop from getting stuck in an infinite loop.","

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

89,CWE-22," YES

The provided Python code is vulnerable to CWE-22, which is Path Traversal. The vulnerability arises because the function `backup_download` takes a `filename` parameter from an external source (presumably a user) and uses it to construct a file path without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to potentially read any file on the system that the application has access to by providing a specially crafted filename.

For example, an attacker could pass a filename like `../../../../etc/passwd` to read the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file on a Unix-like system. The lack of validation for the `filename` parameter means that the application could be tricked into accessing files outside of the intended `settings.backup.folder` directory.

To fix this vulnerability, the application should validate the `filename` parameter to ensure that it does not contain any path traversal sequences (like `../`) and that it only refers to files within the intended directory. Additionally, the application should use secure methods for handling file paths and user input.","

An attacker could potentially manipulate the `filename` parameter to include a malicious URL or path that the server would then attempt to access. This could lead to unauthorized access to internal or external resources, bypassing access controls such as firewalls.

In the context of the provided code, if an attacker can control the `filename` parameter, they could craft a request that causes the server to retrieve content from an unintended destination. This could be used to probe internal networks, access sensitive information, or perform other malicious activities.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate the `filename` parameter to ensure it only contains expected characters and does not include any URL or path traversal components. Additionally, implementing proper access controls and using secure methods for handling file paths can help prevent SSRF attacks.","

The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

Extended description:
By providing URLs to unexpected hosts or ports, attackers can make it appear that the server is sending the request, possibly bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly. The server can be used as a proxy to conduct port scanning of hosts in internal networks, use other URLs such as that can access documents on the system (using file://), or use other protocols such as gopher:// or tftp://, which may provide greater control over the contents of requests.

The provided Python code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-controlled input in the `LocationTable` class. The vulnerability arises from the use of Django's `mark_safe()` API without proper sanitization or escaping of user-generated content.

In the code, the `LocationTable` class is initialized with a `queryset` that filters `Location` objects based on the `name` attribute. The `LocationTable` class is responsible for rendering custom fields, which may contain user-generated content.

The `test_custom_field_table_render` function checks the rendering of custom fields by comparing the rendered values with the expected values. However, the code does not demonstrate the actual rendering process or how the `mark_safe()` API is used.

To confirm the vulnerability, we need to see how the `LocationTable` class renders the custom fields and whether it uses the `mark_safe()` API to mark the user-generated content as safe HTML. If the `mark_safe()` API is used without proper sanitization or escaping, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

To fix the vulnerability, the `LocationTable` class should use Django's built-in template filters like `escape()` or `format_html()` to sanitize and escape user-generated content before rendering","

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.
