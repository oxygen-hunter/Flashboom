The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server Side Request Forgery) as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2021-43780 for Redash. The code snippet is a generic function for making HTTP requests and does not directly handle URL inputs from untrusted sources in a way that would allow an attacker to bypass access controls or use the server as a proxy for unauthorized requests.

The vulnerability described in CVE-2021-43780 is specific to Redash and its handling of URL-loading data sources. The provided code does not include any functionality related to Redash or similar data visualization and sharing platforms. It is a generic function that could be part of a different application, and without additional context or usage, it cannot be determined to be vulnerable to the specific CWE-918 issue mentioned.

However, it is important to note that if this function were to be used in a context where it handles URLs from untrusted sources, proper validation and sanitization of the input should be implemented to prevent potential vulnerabilities.","
The CVE-ID is CVE-2021-43780. The CWE-ID is CWE-918.

[{'lang': 'en', 'value': ""Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly.

The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CWE-201-02 issue described. The CWE-201-02 issue involves the server receiving a URL that references a resource, but the server then retrieves the content of the URL itself, which could be malicious. This can lead to various attacks, such as bypassing access controls or causing the server to execute unintended actions.

In the provided code, the `list_books` function is designed to list books based on a query string parameter `q`. The function retrieves books from the database based on the search term and pagination parameters. It does not involve any URL retrieval or processing that could lead to the execution of unintended actions based on external URLs.

The function uses SQLAlchemy ORM to query the database, and it does not execute any raw SQL queries that could be manipulated with external URLs. The search term is used to filter the books, but it is not directly used in a way that could lead to the execution of unintended actions based on external URLs.

Therefore, the code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CWE-20EE-02 issue.","

The provided code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CWE-ID CWE-918. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not validate or sanitize the URLs or requests it retrieves from the database before using them. If an attacker can manipulate the database entries to include malicious URLs or requests, the server could be tricked into making requests to unintended destinations.

In the code, the `calibre_db.fill_indexpage` function is called with `db_filter` as an argument, which is derived from the `config.config_read_column`. If an attacker can modify the `config.config_read_column` or the data in the `ub.ReadBook` table, they could potentially inject a malicious URL or request that the server will process.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize any URLs or requests retrieved from the database before using them. Additionally, the server should implement proper access controls and network security measures to prevent unautrighted access to internal resources.","

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a type of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code retrieves the contents of a URL or similar request from an upstream component without sufficiently ensuring that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

In the code, the `series_list` function retrieves data from the `calibre_db.session.query` method, which could potentially be influenced by an attacker if they can manipulate the input to the `current_user.get_view_property` method. If an attacker can control the `series` property, they might be able to inject a malicious URL that the server will retrieve and process.

To mitright the vulnerability, you should ensure that the URLs or requests being processed are validated and sanitized, and that they are only allowed to be sent to trusted destinations. Additionally, you should implement proper access controls and input validation to prevent attackers from manipulating the input to the `current_user.get_view_property` method.","

For the most thorough protection server administrators should remove the deprecated `federation_ip_range_blacklist` from their settings after upgrading to Synapse v1.25.0 which will result in Synapse using the improved default IP address restrictions. See the new `ip_range_blacklist` and `ip_range_whitelist` settings if more specific control is necessary.'}]

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, specifically reflected XSS, which is a type of CWE-73 vulnerability. The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles user-controlled input (the `bad_url` and `good_url` variables) and reflects it back in the HTTP response without proper sanitization or encoding.

In the `test_security_check` function, the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` variables are constructed using the `urlquote` function, which is intended to encode the user-controlled input. However, the `urlquote` function is not a standard Python function and may not properly encode all characters that could be used in an XSS attack.

The vulnerability is present in the following lines:

```python
nasty_url = '%(url)s?%(next)s=%(bad_url)s' % {
    'url': login_url,
    'next': REDIRECT_FIELD_NAME,
    'bad_url': urlquote(bad_url),

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

                  Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.
                  Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-918, Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the way the code modifies the `recipe.link` URL before making the HTTP GET request. By replacing 'www.dropbox.' with 'dl.dropboxusercontent.', the code potentially allows an attacker to manipulate the URL to point to an internal or unintended server.

Extended description:

These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, ""GET /index.html HTTP/1.1"" is a structured message containing a command (""GET"") with a single argument (""/index.html"") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (""HTTP/1.1"").
            If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata.

CWE description:
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

The code snippet is a test function for a web application that sends POST requests with different payloads and checks the response. The vulnerability described in CVE-2021-32677 is specific to FastAPI versions lower than 0.65.2, where the application would incorrectly parse JSON data from a request with a content-type of text/plain.

The test function in the provided code does not have any issues with content-type headers or parsing JSON data from text/plain requests. It sends JSON data with the correct content-type header (json) and checks for expected responses. The function also includes a test case where it patches the json.loads function to raise an exception, simulating a parsing error.

The additional function `hasValidPath` is unrelated to the CWE-352 vulnerability and does not seem to be part of the web application's request handling. It appears to be a separate function for checking the validity of a path in a grid.

In conclusion, the provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-352 based on the information given.","
The CVE-ID is CVE-2021-32677. The CWE-ID is CWE-352.
CVE description:
[{'lang': 'en', 'value': ""FastAPI is a web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. FastAPI versions lower than 0.65.2 that used cookies for authentication in path operations that received JSON payloads sent by browsers were vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. In versions lower than 0.65.2, FastAPI would try to read the request payload as JSON even if the content-type header sent was not set to application/json or a compatible JSON media type (e.g. application/geo+json). A request with a content type of text/plain containing JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data would be extracted. Requests with content type text/plain are exempt from CORS preflights, for being considered Simple requests. The browser will execute them right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application. This is fixed in FastAPI 0.65.2. The request data is now parsed as JSON only if the content-type header is application/json or another JSON compatible media type like application/geo+json. It's best to upgrade to the latest FastAPI, but if updating is not possible then a middleware or a dependency that checks the content-type header and aborts the request if it is not application/json or another JSON compatible content type can act as a mitigating workaround.""}]

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles the `reason` parameter when generating the error response. The `reason` parameter is directly passed to `json.dumps` and then included in the URL for the login redirection. If an attacker can control the `reason` parameter, they could inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed when the error message is displayed to the user.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `reason` string is not properly escaped before being included in the JSON response and the URL. This can allow an attacker to inject a script tag or other executable code that the browser will execute when the error message is rendered.

To fix this vulnerability, the `reason` parameter should be properly escaped before being included in the JSON response and the URL. This can be done using the `escape` function from the `django.utils.html` module or a similar escaping function provided by the framework being used. Additionally, the `reason` parameter should be validated to ensure it does not contain any malicious content before being processed.","

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-controlled input in the `LocationTable` rendering process. The vulnerability arises from the use of Django's `mark_safe()` API without proper sanitization or escaping of user-generated content.

In the code, custom fields like `text_field`, `number_field`, `boolean_field`, `date_field`, `url_right_field`, `choice_field`, and `multi_choice_field` are being set with values that may contain user-controlled input. If these values are not properly sanitized or escaped, they can be used to inject malicious scripts into the rendered HTML.

The `mark_safe()` function is used to mark a string as safe (i.e., safe to be rendered as HTML) without escaping it. This function should only be used when the string is known to be safe, such as when it is generated by the application itself. However, in this case, the string is being generated from user-controlled input, which makes it unsafe.

                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

[{'lang': 'en', 'value': 'Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in GitHub repository janeczku/calibre-web prior to 0.6.18.'}]

CWE description:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

Extended description:
By providing URLs to unexpected hosts or ports, attackers can make it appear that the server is sending the request, possibly bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly. The server can be used as a proxy to conduct port scanning of hosts in internal networks, use other URLs such as that can access documents on the system (using file://), or use other protocols such as gopher:// or tftp://, which may provide greater control over the contents of requests.
