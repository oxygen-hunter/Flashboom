The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, specifically Type 1: Reflected XSS (Non-Persistent). The vulnerability arises from the way the `test_security_check` function constructs the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` using the `urlquote` function. If the `urlquote` function does not properly encode or sanitize the `bad_url` and `good_url` inputs, it could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the URLs.

For example, if an attacker can control the `bad_url` or `good_url` input, they could craft a URL that includes JavaScript code, which would be reflected back to the victim's browser when they click on the link. This could lead to the execution of the malicious script in the victim's browser, compromising their security.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `urlquote` function properly encodes or sanitizes the input to prevent the injection of malicious scripts. Additionally, you should review the `is_safe_url` function in Django's `utils.py` file to ensure it correctly validates and sanitizes URLs to prevent XSS attacks.",2776,276,12.804994344711304

The provided `get_EE` function is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a form of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function takes a URL from the `recipe.link` attribute, modifies it by replacing a substring, and then uses the `requests.get` function to fetch the content from the modified URL. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `recipe.link` to point to an internal or sensitive resource on the server or even to a malicious server, leading to information disclosure or other security issues.

In the context of the CVE-ID CVE-2022-23071, the vulnerability is specifically related to the ""Import Recipe"" functionality in the Recipes application, where an attacker can enter a localhost URL to access sensitive information. While the provided code snippet does not directly relate to the Recipes application, the underlying issue of trusting external URLs without proper validation and sanitization is similar.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the `recipe.link` before using it to make a request, ensuring that it only points to allowed and expected destinations. Additionally, implementing proper access controls and network security measures can help prevent unautrighted access to internal resources.",1061,294,12.57140326499939

The provided Python code is vulnerable because it uses the `exec` function to execute code that is retrieved from an external source (`config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`). This is a classic example of a code injection vulnerability, specifically CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (Incorrect Awareness). The `exec` function can execute arbitrary code, and if the content of the file retrieved by `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile` is not properly sanitized or validated, it could contain malicious code that would be executed. This could lead to a situation where an attacker could inject commands or code that the program would execute, potentially leading to unautpta, data theft, or other security breaches.",1337,179,7.950201749801636
83,CWE-22," YES

The provided code snippet is vulnerable due to the use of the `exec` function, which executes the code it receives as a string. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if the input (`doc` in this case) is not properly sanitized or comes from an untrusted source. The vulnerability is not specifically CWE-22 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in OWASP), but rather it is a broader issue of executing untrusted code, which can lead to various types of attacks, including but not limited to path traversal.

The `load` function takes a `doc` parameter, retrieves a code string from a configuration using `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`, and then executes this code using `exec(code, globals())`. If an attacker can control the `doc` parameter, they could potentially inject malicious code that would be executed by the `exec` function, leading to a security breach.

The provided `backup_download` function is vulnerable to CWE-22, which is an issue related to improper input validation leading to directory traversal. In this case, the function takes a `filename` parameter and uses it to construct a file path by joining it with a predefined backup folder path. If an attacker can control the `filename` input, they could potentially include special directory traversal sequences like ""../"" to navigate up the directory tree and access files outside of the intended backup directory.

For example, if an attacker passes a `filename` like ""../etc/passwd"", the resulting path would be outside of the backup directory, potentially allowing them to read sensitive files from the system.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should validate the `filename` input to ensure it does not contain any directory traversal sequences or other malicious patterns before using it to construct a file path.",1035,199,8.651040315628052

The provided `backup_download` function is vulnerable to CWE-22, which is Path Traversal. The vulnerability arises because the function takes a `filename` parameter, which is used to construct a file path by joining it with a predefined backup folder path.

The provided `swaggerui_static` function is vulnerable to CWE-22, which is an ""Improper Input Handling"" issue. This vulnerability arises because the function constructs a file path using user-controlled input (`filename`) without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker could exploit this by providing a specially crafted filename that includes path traversal sequences (like ""../"") to access files outside of the intended directory. This could lead to unauthorized file access or disclosure of sensitive information.",1075,119,5.183868408203125
93,CWE-22," YES

The provided `swaggerui_static` function is vulnerable to CWE-22, which is a path traversal vulnerability. The function takes a `filename` parameter and uses it to construct a file path by joining it with a base directory path. If an attacker can control the `filename` parameter, they could potentially supply a string that navigates up the directory tree (using ""../"" sequences) or directly to a system file. This could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files on the server that the application has access to, leading to information disclosure or other security issues.

For example, if an attacker passes a `filename` like ""../../../../etc/passwd"", the function could potentially return the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file on a Unix-like system, which contains user account information.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should validate the `filename` parameter to ensure it does not contain any path traversal sequences or other unexpected characters before using it to construct a file path. Additionally, the application should consider using a whitelist approach, where only known, safe filenames are allowed, or a more secure method of serving static files that does not rely on user-controlled input for file paths.",1067,269,11.575098752975464

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-controlled input in the `test_custom_field_table_render` function. The vulnerability arises from the use of Django's `mark_safe` function to mark strings as safe for HTML output without proper sanitization. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, which can be executed by the browser when the page is rendered.

In the code, the `custom_column_expected` dictionary contains values that are marked as safe using `mark_safe`. If an attacker can manipulate the values in this dictionary, they can inject malicious scripts that will be executed when the `LocationTable` renders the custom fields.

To fix this vulnerability, you should avoid using `mark_safe` for user-controlled input and instead use Django's built-in template filters like `escape` or `format_html` to properly sanitize the input before rendering it in the web page. Additionally, you should review the `CustomFieldColumn` class to ensure that it properly escapes any user-controlled input before rendering it in the HTML.",2659,260,12.056264400482178
