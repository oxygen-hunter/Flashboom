The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, specifically reflected XSS (Type 1). The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles user-supplied URLs and includes them in the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` without proper sanitization or validation.

In the `test_security_check` function, the `bad_url` and `good_url` variables are constructed by concatenating user-supplied URLs with the `login_url` and `REDIRECT_FIELD_NAME`. The `urlquote` function is used to URL-encode the `bad_url` and `good_url`, but this is not sufficient to prevent XSS attacks.

An attacker can craft a malicious URL that includes JavaScript code or other executable content, which will be reflected back to the victim's browser when they visit the `nasty_url` or `safe_url`. Since the code does not properly sanitize or validate the user-supplied URLs, the reflected content can be executed by the victim's browser, leading to an XSS attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques to ensure that only safe and expected URLs are included in the `nasty_url` and `safe_url`. Additionally, the code should use a secure",2760,301,13.681934118270874

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a type of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles the `recipe.link` URL.

This can be a significant security risk if the code being executed comes from an untrusted source, as it can lead to arbitrary code execution. In the context of CWE-22 (Path Traversal), if the `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile` function retrieves a file path from an untrusted source and that path is used to construct the `code` string, it could potentially lead to a path traversal attack if the file content is not properly sanitized before being executed.

In the `maxSubsequence` function, there is no direct indication of a path traversal vulnerability, but it's important to ensure that any external input used within this function is properly validated and sanitized to prevent potential security issues.",968,192,8.414449214935303

The provided Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery) as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2021-32677. The code snippet is a test function for a web application that sends POST requests with different payloads and checks the responses. The vulnerability described in CVE-2021-32677 is specific to FastAPI versions lower than 0.65.2 and their handling of JSON payloads and content-type headers.

The test function does not directly interact with the FastAPI application or its request handling mechanisms. It only sends requests and checks the responses. The vulnerability in FastAPI would be related to how the application processes incoming requests and parses JSON data based on the content-type header.

The function `maxSubsequence` is unrelated to the web application's request handling and does not contribute to any CWE-352 vulnerability.

Therefore, based on the provided code snippet, there is no indication of a CWE-352 vulnerability.",1625,247,10.832422494888306

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-444, which is related to HTTP smuggling attacks. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `smuggle_url` function, which is not shown in the code snippet but is implied to be used for setting HTTP headers. If `smuggle_url` does not properly sanitize or validate the input it receives, it could be exploited to manipulate the HTTP headers in a way that allows an attacker to smuggle malicious requests through the intermediary HTTP agent (such as a proxy or firewall).

The CWE-444 description indicates that an intermediary HTTP agent might not interpret malformed HTTP requests or responses consistently with how the ultimate destination (client or server) would. This inconsistency can be exploited to smuggle messages to the client or server without the intermediary being aware of it.

In the context of the provided code, if `smuggle_url` is not designed to handle HTTP header injection attacks, an attacker could potentially manipulate the 'Referer' header or other headers to bypass security controls or perform other malicious actions.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to ensure that `smuggle_url` and any other functions that handle HTTP headers are designed to properly sanitize and validate all inputs to prevent HTTP smugg",1992,301,13.500327825546265

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it directly uses user-controlled input (`reason`) in the JSON response without proper escaping. This can lead to XSS attacks if an attacker crafts a `reason` string containing malicious JavaScript code.",2259,65,3.3938958644866943
89,CWE-22," YES

The provided `backup_download` function is vulnerable to CWE-22, which is an ""Improper Input Handling"" issue, specifically a ""Path Traversal"" vulnerability. This vulnerability arises because the function takes a `filename` parameter, which is used to construct a file path by joining it with a predefined backup folder path. If an attacker can control the `filename` input, they could potentially include special directory traversal sequences like ""../"" to access files outside of the intended backup directory.

For example, if an attacker provides a `filename` like ""../etc/passwd"", the resulting path would be outside of the `settings.backup.folder` directory, potentially allowing them to read sensitive files on the server.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should validate the `filename` input to ensure it does not contain any directory traversal sequences or other unexpected characters before using it to construct a file path. Additionally, the application should enforce proper access controls to ensure that even if a traversal occurs, the files accessed are not sensitive or critical to the system's security.",1019,245,10.599889993667603

The provided `swaggerui_static` function is vulnerable to CWE-22, which is an ""Improper Input Handling"" issue. This vulnerability arises because the function constructs a file path using user-controlled input (`filename`) without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker could exploit this by providing a specially crafted filename that includes path traversal sequences (like ""../"") to access files outside of the intended directory. This could lead to unauthorized file access or disclosure of sensitive information.",1059,119,5.2819929122924805

The provided `swaggerui_static` function is vulnerable to CWE-22, which is a path traversal vulnerability. The function takes a `filename` parameter and uses it to construct a file path by joining it with a predefined directory path. If an attacker can control the `filename` parameter, they could potentially supply a string that navigates up the directory tree (using ""../"") or directly to a system file, leading to an arbitrary file read vulnerability.

For example, if an attacker passes a `filename` like ""../../../../etc/passwd"", the function would attempt to read the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file on a Unix-like system, which could lead to information disclosure.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should validate the `filename` parameter to ensure it does not contain any path traversal sequences before using it to construct the file path. Additionally, the application should use a whitelist approach to only allow access to a predefined set of files.",1051,222,9.643633127212524

The provided `swaggerui_static` function is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a type of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises because the function takes a filename as an input and returns the contents of that file without validating the input. An attacker could potentially provide a malicious filename that points to an internal or external resource, causing the server to retrieve and serve that content. This could lead to information disclosure, bypassing of security controls, or other malicious activities.",1046,119,5.291343688964844

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-controlable input in the `test_custom_field_table_render` function. The vulnerability arises from the use of Django's `mark_safe` function or similar inappropriate handling of user-controlable input when rendering custom fields in the `LocationTable`. If the `mark_safe` function or a similar mechanism is used to mark the custom field values as safe HTML without proper sanitization, it could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page.

The CVE-2023-48705 and CVE-2023-48705 descriptions indicate that Nautobot incorrectly used Django's `mark_safe` API, which led to the vulnerability. The maintainers have fixed this issue by replacing `mark_safe` with `format_html` in the relevant code, which properly escapes the content.

To ensure the code is not vulnerable, you should verify that the `LocationTable` and `CustomFieldColumn` classes do not use `mark_safe` or similar functions to mark user-controlled input as safe HTML without proper sanitization. Instead, they should use Django's `format_html` function or other appropriate methods to escape the content and prevent the execution",2643,301,13.713806867599487
