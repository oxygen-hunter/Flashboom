The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described by the CWE-ID CWE-918 and the CVE-ID CVE-2022-0939. The code is a Python function for updating a user's profile information, and it does not involve any URL or request handling that could be manipulated for SSRF attacks.

The SSRF vulnerability typically occurs when an application accepts user input that is used to construct a URL or request, and the application then makes a request to that URL or sends the request to another service without proper validation. This can allow an attacker to bypass access controls and potentially access internal resources or perform actions on behalf of the server.

In the provided code, the function `change_profile` takes user input from a form and updates the user's profile information in the database. The user input is sanitized by checking the email and password fields, and the function does not make any external requests or handle URLs based on user input. Therefore, it does not match the typical SSRF vulnerability pattern.

However, it is essential to note that without a complete understanding of the application's architecture and how this function interacts with other components, it is not possible to definitively rule out all potential vulnerabilities.

The provided code is vulnerable to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code retrieves content from URLs without proper validation or sanitization. If an attacker can influence the `book_id` or any other input that affects the URLs being fetched, they could potentially make the server send requests to arbitrary locations.

For example, if the `calibre_db.get_book_read_archived` function retrieves data from a URL that includes the `book_id` in its path, an attacker could manipulate the `book_id` to point to a malicious server. The server would then send a request to the attacker's server, which could lead to information disclosure or other malicious activities.

This can be exploited by an attacker to inject CRLF sequences into the application, potentially leading to a CRLF injection attack.

In the context of the `findGoodStrings` method, the vulnerability is not directly exploitable because the method does not involve any user input or external data that could be manipulated to include CRLF sequences. However, the `__setitem__` method's vulnerability still exists in the overall codebase, and it could be exploited in other parts of the application where user input or external data is handled.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to sanitize and escape all user inputs and external data before using them in the application.

In the context of the `filter` method, the vulnerability could be exploited if an attacker can control the input `names` and inject CRLF sequences or other control characters that could lead to unintended behavior when interacting with the `self.dict` dictionary.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques to ensure that the input `names` do not contain any malicious content before using them to access or modify the `self.dict` dictionary. This could involve escaping or removing control characters, validating the input against a whitelist of allowed characters, or using other input validation techniques to prevent CRLF injection attacks and other related security issues.",1043,264,11.522765874862671

The `urlquote` function is used to encode the `bad_url` and `good_url` values, but this is not sufficient to prevent XSS attacks.

The issue is that the `urlquote` function only encodes the `bad_url` and `good_url` values, but it does not sanitize them. This means that an attacker can still inject malicious scripts into the `bad_url` and `good_url` parameters, which will be reflected back to the user's browser when the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` are accessed.

An attacker could craft a malicious `recipe.link` that, when processed by the `get_file` function, causes the server to make a request to an internal or sensitive resource. This could lead to unautrighted access to internal file systems or other sensitive information, bypassing access controls such as firewalls.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the `recipe.link` before using it to make a request. This could involve checking that the URL is a valid Dropbox link and that it points to an expected and safe destination.

The provided code snippet for `data_received` is vulnerable to CWE-835, which is an infinite loop condition. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the loop condition `while self._buffer:` does not have a guaranteed exit condition that can be reached under certain circumstances. If the `self._buffer` never gets updated to an empty string or is not properly cleared after processing a message, the loop will continue indefinitely, leading to excessive consumption of CPU or memory resources.

In the context of the provided code, if the `self.messages.put_nowait((header, buf))` operation fails to execute correctly or if the `self._buffer` is not being reduced correctly after processing a message, the loop will not terminate as expected. This could happen due to various reasons, such as an exception being raised during the processing of the message or an issue with the `messages` queue implementation.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to ensure that the loop has a proper exit condition that can be reached under all circumstances. This can be achieved by adding additional checks or conditions to the loop to handle edge cases and ensure that the loop terminates when expected.",1390,255,11.069418907165527

Instead, the vulnerability lies in the usage of the `smuggle_url` function, which is not a standard Python function and is not provided in the code snippet. If `smuggle_url` is a custom function that manipulates HTTP headers or performs URL smuggling, it could potentially be exploited in a similar way to the CVE-2023-46121 issue with yt-dlp.

The provided code is vulnerable to the CWE-78 (Cross-Site Scripting) due to the way it handles the `reason` parameter when generating an error response for AJAX requests. The `reason` parameter is directly passed to the `json.dumps` function without proper sanitization or encoding, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the error message.

In the code snippet, the `reason` parameter is being force-text encoded and then JSON-encoded using `json.dumps`. However, the `force_text` function does not perform any escaping or sanitization of the input, which means that if the `reason` parameter contains JavaScript or other executable code, it will be included in the JSON response as-is. When the client receives this response and parses the JSON, the malicious script could be executed in the context of the web page, leading to a reflected XSS vulnerability.

To fix this issue, the `reason` parameter should be properly sanitized and encoded to ensure that any potentially harmful content is neutralized before being included in the error response. This can be done by using a library or function that is designed to escape or sanitize user input, such as `escape` or `html` from Django's template system, or `html.escape` from Python's standard library.",2454,294,13.277884006500244

The provided `backup_download` function is vulnerable to CWE-22, which is an issue related to improper input validation and insufficient input filtering, leading to an arbitrary file read vulnerability. In the context of the provided code, the vulnerability arises from the fact that the function takes a `filename` parameter from the user and directly uses it to construct a file path without validating or sanitizing the input. This allows an attacker to potentially supply a filename that navigates the file system (using sequences like ""../"") to access files outside the intended `settings.backup.folder` directory.

The vulnerability is similar to the one described in the CVE-ID CVE-2EE-23264, where the application does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory. This can lead to unauthorized access to the file system, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing the execution of malicious code.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `backup_download` function should implement proper input validation and sanitization to ensure that the `filename` parameter does not contain any sequences that could lead to path traversal. Additionally, it should enforce access controls to ensure that only authorized users can access the files within the `settings.backup.folder",1214,301,12.901725769042969

The vulnerability arises from the way the `filename` parameter is used in the `send_file` function without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially supply a `filename` that includes path traversal sequences (like ""../"") to access files outside the intended directory.

In the `swaggerui_static` function, the `filename` parameter is directly concatenated with the path to the `flask_restx/static` directory. If an attacker can control the `filename` parameter, they could craft a string that navigates up the directory tree (using ""../"") and access sensitive files on the server.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should validate the `filename` parameter to ensure it does not contain any path traversal sequences or other unexpected characters. Additionally, you could use a whitelist approach, where only specific filenames are allowed to be accessed, or use a function that safely constructs file paths, such as `os.path.join` combined with `os.path.basename` to ensure that only the intended filename is used.",1254,260,11.290489196777344

The provided code for `swaggerui_static` is vulnerable to CWE-22, which is an issue related to uncontrolled format string vulnerabilities. However, the CWE-22 description provided in the question seems to be incorrect in the context of the given code. The actual vulnerability in the `swaggerui_static` function is related to CWE-20, which is an issue of unrestricted input upon a file read operation.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function takes a `filename` parameter and directly uses it to construct a file path without any validation or sanitization. An attacker could exploit this by providing a specially crafted `filename` that includes path traversal sequences (like ""../"") or other malicious input to access files outside the intended directory. This could lead to unauthorized file disclosure or other security issues.

To fix this vulnerability, the `filename` parameter should be validated and sanitized before being used to construct the file path. This could involve checking that the `filename` only contains expected characters, does not include path traversal sequences, and is within the expected directory structure.",1246,256,11.222418546676636
94,CWE-918," YES

The provided Python code for `swaggerui_static` is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a type of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises because the function takes a filename as an input and uses it to construct a file path to retrieve static files from the server's file system. If an attacker can control the filename parameter, they could potentially craft a path that leads to unauthorized access to the server's file system or even to internal network resources.

In the context of the CVE-ID CVE-2023-50266, the vulnerability is similar in that it involves the server processing a URL or file path that is not properly validated, which can lead to SSRF. The attacker could exploit this by providing a specially crafted filename that points to a different location on the server or network, bypassing security controls and potentially accessing sensitive information.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `swaggerui_static` function should validate the filename parameter to ensure it only points to allowed static files within the expected directory. Additionally, implementing a whitelist of allowed file paths or using a more secure method to serve static files, such as using a content delivery network (CDN) or a dedicated static file server, can help prevent this type of vulnerability.",1241,298,12.929463624954224
95,CWE-79," YES

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-controlled input in the `LocationTable` rendering process. The vulnerability arises from the use of Django's `mark_safe` function to mark strings as safe for HTML output without proper sanitization or escaping of user-controlled input.

In the `test_custom_field_table_render` function, the `custom_column_expected` dictionary contains values that are marked as safe using `mark_safe`. This means that when these values are rendered in the HTML output, they will be interpreted as HTML elements or scripts by the browser. If an attacker can manipulate the values in the `custom_column_expected` dictionary, they can inject malicious scripts that will be executed when the rendered table is displayed to users.

To fix this vulnerability, you should avoid using `mark_safe` for user-controlled input and instead use Django's built-in template filters like `escape` or `format_html` to properly escape or sanitize the input before rendering it in the HTML output. This will prevent the execution of any malicious scripts injected by an attacker.",2838,262,12.093292474746704
