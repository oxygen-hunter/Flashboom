The provided Python code is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a type of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles the URL for the Dropbox file retrieval.

In the `get_file` function, the code replaces 'www.dropbox.' with 'dl.dropboxusercontent.' in the `recipe.link` URL before making the request. This replacement is done without any validation or sanitization of the input URL. An attacker can exploit this by providing a malicious URL that points to an internal or unexpected host or port.

For example, an attacker could provide a URL like `http://internal-server:8080/secret-data` as the `recipe.link`. The code would then replace 'www.dropbox.' with 'dl.dropboxusercontent.' resulting in `http://dl.dropboxusercontent.internal-server:8pta-data`, which the server would then attempt to access. This could potentially allow the attacker to bypass access controls and access sensitive information on the server or use the server as a proxy for other malicious activities.

The provided Python code for the `backup_download` function is vulnerable to CWE-22, which is an Improper Input Handling vulnerability. This vulnerability occurs when a program does not properly handle user input, which can lead to various security issues, including path traversal attacks.

In the `backup_download` function, the `filename` parameter is directly concatenated with the `settings.backup.folder` path to construct the file path for the `send_file` function. If an attacker can control the `filename` input, they could potentially manipulate the path to access files outside of the intended `settings.backup.folder` directory.

For example, an attacker could provide a `filename` like `../../../../etc/passwd` to attempt to read the system's password file. This is a classic example of a path traversal attack, where the attacker uses special elements like ""../"" to navigate up the directory tree and access files that should not be accessible through the application.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should sanitize and validate the `filename` input to ensure that it does not contain any path traversal sequences or other malicious content. Additionally, the application should enforce proper access controls to restrict file access to authorized users and directories.",1133,285,12.325214862823486

While the provided code snippet does not directly show the vulnerable `proxy` method mentioned in the CVE description, the `swaggerui_static` function could be part of a larger application where such a vulnerability exists.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should validate the `filename` parameter to ensure it only points to allowed files within the application's directory structure and does not contain any user-controlled input that could lead to SSRF.

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-controlled input in the `test_custom_field_table_render` function. The vulnerability arises from the use of Django's `mark_safe` function, which marks a string as safe (i.e., safe to be rendered in a template without escaping). If the `custom_column_expected` dictionary contains user-controlled input that is not properly sanitized or escaped, it could lead to XSS attacks when rendered in a web page.

In the code snippet, the `custom_column_expected` dictionary is populated with values that include HTML tags and attributes, such as `<span class=""label label-default"">Bar</span>` and `<a href=""http://example.com/2"">http://example.com/2</a>`. If these values are derived from user input and not properly sanitized, they could be used to inject malicious scripts into the web page.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that any user-controlled input is properly sanitized and escaped before being rendered in a web page.
