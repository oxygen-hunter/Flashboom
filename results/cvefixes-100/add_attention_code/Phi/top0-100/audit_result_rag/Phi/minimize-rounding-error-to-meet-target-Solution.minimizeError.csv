The provided code snippet for `add_security_headers` does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery) based on the information given. The CWE-918 vulnerability involves the web server not properly validating or sanitizing URLs or other inputs that it retrieves from upstream components, which could lead to SSRF attacks.

In the provided code, the `Content-Security-Policy` header is being set with a policy that restricts the sources from which content can be loaded. The policy includes trusted hosts and other directives like `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'`. The code does not show any functionality that would allow for the server to retrieve and execute content from arbitrary or untrusted sources based on user input or other external inputs.

However, it is important to note that without the full context of how the `config.config_trustedhosts` and `config.config_use_google_drive` variables are set and how the `request.endpoint` is determined, it is not possible to definitively say that the code is not vulnerable to any other types of vulnerabilities.

The provided code for `add_security_headers` does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery) based on the information given. The CWE-918 vulnerability involves the web server not properly validating or restricting URLs or requests it retrieves from upstream components, potentially allowing attackers to bypass access controls.

In the `add_security_headers` function, the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) is being set based on the `config.config_trustedhosts` and the endpoint being accessed. The CSP directives are restricting the sources for various types of content (e.g., default-src, font-src, img-src, etc.) and adding some allowances for unsafe inline scripts and evals. The CSP is not directly handling or processing any external URLs or requests, so it does not appear to be susceptible to CWE-918.

This could potentially reveal sensitive information about the state of the transaction, which is a security risk.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should be refactored to ensure that the execution time does not depend on the secret data (in this case, the `transaction.action_required` flag).

The vulnerability lies in the way the `urlquote` function is used to sanitize the `bad_url` and `good_url` variables before they are included in the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` strings. The `urlquote` function is intended to encode special characters in URLs to prevent them from being interpreted as control characters in the browser.

The vulnerability lies in the way the code handles the authentication process. Specifically, the code is vulnerable to a ""password reuse"" attack. This is because the code does not enforce a unique constraint on the combination of username and password. An attacker could potentially reuse a password from a different user with the same username to gain unautrighted access.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to enforce a unique constraint on the combination of username and password. This can be achieved by adding a unique constraint on the username and password fields in the database or by implementing a check in the code to ensure that the combination of username and password is unique before creating a new user.

Additionally, the code should also implement a mechanism to enforce strong passwords, such as requiring a minimum length, a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This will help to further protect against unauthorized access.

This vulnerability is related to CWE-22 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Input), as the code does not properly neutralize the content of the file before executing it. The CWE-22 issue is about not properly handling special elements in input that can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as path traversal or code injection.

The `LocationTable` class is likely to render HTML content based on the `custom_column_expected` dictionary values, which contain HTML tags and attributes. If an attacker can manipulate the values in `custom_column_expected`, they could inject malicious scripts that would be executed when the `LocationTable` is rendered in the browser.
