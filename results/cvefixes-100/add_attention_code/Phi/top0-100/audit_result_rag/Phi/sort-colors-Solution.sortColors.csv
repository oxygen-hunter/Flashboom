The provided code snippet for the `get_response` function does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server Side Request Forgery) as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2021-43780 for Redash. The vulnerability in Redash was related to the handling of URL-loading data sources, which could be exploited to bypass access controls.

In the given code, there is no direct evidence of URL handling or request forwarding that would allow an attacker to manipulate the destination of the request. The function simply makes an HTTP request to the provided URL using the `requests` library and handles the response. The vulnerability in Redash was specifically related to the use of the `requests` library in certain versions and the handling of URLs within the application.

However, without more context about the `requests_session` object and the environment in which this code is running, it is not possible to definitively say that there are no other vulnerabilities present. It is always recommended to follow best practices for secure coding and to keep dependencies up to date to mitright vulnerabilities.",1646,243,10.27153730392456
2,CWE-918," YES, the provided Python code is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a type of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses the `socket.gethostbyname()` function to resolve the hostname to an IP address. An attacker could exploit this by providing a malicious URL that points to a server controlled by them. When the `gethostbyname()` function is called, it sends a DNS request to the DNS server. If the DNS server is compromised or misconfigured, it could return an IP address that the attacker controls.

In this case, the attacker could set up a server that responds to the DNS request with an IP address that is not a valid host but is still reachable by the server running the code. The server would then attempt to connect to this IP address, which could lead to unautrighted access to the attacker's server or network.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should ensure that the server only resolves hostnames to IP addresses from trusted sources and that proper access controls are in place to prevent unauthorized access to the server's network. Additionally, you could implement input validation to ensure that only valid URLs are processed by the `is_private_address()` function.",1016,290,12.036370992660522

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, specifically reflected XSS (Type 1). The vulnerability arises from the way the application handles user-supplied data (URLs in this case) and reflects it back in the HTTP response without proper sanitization or encoding.

In the `test_security_check` function, the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` variables are constructed using user-controlled input (the `bad_url` and `good_url` variables). These URLs are then used in the `self.client.post` method to simulate a POST request to the login URL.

The vulnerability occurs when the application reflects the user-controlled input back in the HTTP response without proper sanitization or encoding. An attacker can craft a malicious URL with JavaScript code embedded in it, and when the application reflects this URL back in the HTTP response, the JavaScript code will be executed by the victim's browser.

For example, an attacker could craft a URL like this:

```
http://example.com?next=http://malicious.com/script.js
```

When the application reflects this URL back in the HTTP response, the victim's browser will execute the JavaScript code contained in the `script.js` file hosted on the attacker's server",2490,301,13.236871004104614

The vulnerability in the code is related to the handling of the 'passwordCredentials' field in the 'auth' dictionary. The code does not properly validate the 'userId' field within 'passwordCredentials'. An attacker could potentially exploit this by providing a 'userId' that corresponds to a disabled user account, and the code would still generate a token for that user.

Here's the vulnerable part of the code:

In this case, the `load` function retrieves a file named ""bs-extensions"" from the `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile` function and executes its contents using `exec`. If an attacker can control the contents of the ""bs-extensions"" file, they can execute arbitrary code on the system where this code is running.

This vulnerability is related to CWE-22 (Improper Input Validation), as the code does not properly validate or sanitize the input (the contents of the ""bs-extensions"" file) before executing it.

An attacker could exploit this by providing a specially crafted filename that includes path traversal sequences like ""../"" or absolute paths to access files outside of the intended `settings.backup.folder` directory.

For example, an attacker could provide a filename like ""../../etc/passwd"" to potentially access the system's password file. This could lead to unautrighted file disclosure and other security issues.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should sanitize the `filename` input by removing or neutralizing any path traversal sequences before using it to construct the file path.",749,190,7.921728849411011

92,CWE-22," YES, the provided Python code is vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal).

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function `swaggerui_static` takes a `filename` parameter and uses it to construct a file path without validating or sanitizing the input. An attacker could exploit this by providing a specially crafted `filename` that includes path traversal sequences like ""../"" to access files outside of the intended directory.

For example, if an attacker provides a `filename` like ""../../../../etc/passwd"", the function would attempt to read the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file on a Unix-like system, which could lead to information disclosure or other security issues.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the `filename` input to ensure it does not contain any path traversal sequences or other unexpected characters. Additionally, the application should enforce proper access controls to restrict access to sensitive files.",789,211,8.780630826950073

94,CWE-918," YES, the provided code is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a blind server-side request forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function `swaggerui_static` takes a `filename` parameter and uses it to construct a file path to retrieve a file from the server's file system. If an attacker can control the `filename` parameter, they could potentially craft a path that leads to sensitive files on the server or even execute arbitrary code, depending on the server's configuration and the underlying file system.

In the context of the CVE-ID CVE-2023-50266, the vulnerability is similar in that it involves the server retrieving content from a URL or file path that is not properly validated, which can lead to SSRF attacks. In the case of the provided code, the `filename` parameter could be manipulated to access files outside the intended `static` directory, leading to information disclosure or other security issues.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate the `filename` parameter to ensure it only points to files within the intended directory and does not contain any path traversal sequences or other malicious input. Additionally, the server should have proper access controls and file permissions to prevent unautsinfofied file access.",776,288,11.953262329101562

The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-79 (Cross-Site Scripting) based on the given context. The code snippet is a test method for a custom field table render in a web application, and it does not involve any user input being directly rendered into HTML without proper sanitization or escaping. The values being compared in the `custom_column_expected` dictionary are static strings and do do not contain any user-controlled input that could be executed as code.

However, without the full context of how the `LocationTable` and `CustomFieldColumn` classes handle user input and render content to the web page, it is not possible to definitively say that the code is free from all vulnerabilities. It is important to ensure that any user-controlged input is properly sanitized and escaped when rendering content to the web page to prevent XSS and other vulnerabilities.",2373,195,8.769077062606812

The provided code snippet for `create_book_on_upload` does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery) as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2022-0939. The function does not involve any web request handling or URL processing that could be manipulated by an attacker to forge a server-side request. It is a function that seems to be part of a book management system, where it processes metadata for a book upload and interacts with a database.

The vulnerability described in CVE-2022-0939 involves a web server that improperly handles URLs or requests, potentially allowing an attacker to use the server as a proxy for unauthorized access or data retrieval. The code snippet you've provided does not involve any web server request handling or URL processing that could be exploited in this way.

However, without the full context of how this function is used within the application, it's not possible to definitively say there are no vulnerabilities. It's always important to review the entire application and its interactions with external systems to ensure there are no security issues.",1793,261,11.059216260910034
