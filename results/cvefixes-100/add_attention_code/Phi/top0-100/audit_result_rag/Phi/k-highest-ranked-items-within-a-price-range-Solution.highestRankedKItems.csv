The provided code snippet for the `get_response` function does not appear to be vulnerable to the CWE-918 issue described in the CVE-ID CVE-2021-43780. The CWE-918 issue is related to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities, which typically involve a web server making HTTP requests to unintended destinations based on user input.

In the provided code, the `get_response` function is making an HTTP request to a URL specified by the `url` parameter. The function does not directly use any user-controlled input to construct the URL or the request parameters. Instead, it uses the `auth` parameter for authentication and the `**kwargs` parameter to pass additional request parameters.

The vulnerability described in CVE-2021-43780 is related to Redash's implementation of URL-loading data sources, which could be exploited by attackers to make the server send requests to unintended destinations. However, the provided code snippet does not involve any URL-loading data sources or similar functionality.

Therefore, based on the provided code snippet, it does not appear to be vulnerable to the CWE-918 issue described in CVE-2021-43780.",2192,293,12.834314107894897
2,CWE-918," YES

The provided Python code is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is related to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses `socket.gethostbyname(hostname)` to resolve the hostname to an IP address. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `url` parameter to point to a malicious server or an internal server that the web server should not have access to. This could allow the attacker to bypass firewall rules or access sensitive information.

In the context of the provided code, the `is_private_address` function is not directly related to the CWE-918 vulnerability mentioned in the CVE-ID CVE-2021-43780. However, the vulnerability in the code is due to the lack of validation or sanitization of the input URL before it is used to resolve the hostname.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate the input URL to ensure it is a legitimate and expected URL before resolving the hostname. Additionally, the code should implement proper error handling to prevent the resolution of unexpected or malicious hostnames.",1562,258,10.859000205993652

The provided code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2022-0939. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not sufficiently ensure that the URL being retrieved by the web server is being sent to the expected destination. This can allow attackers to make it appear that the server is sending the request, potentially bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly.

In the code, the vulnerability could be present in the following line:

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `test_security_check` function handles the `bad_url` and `good_url` parameters when constructing the `nasty_url` and `safe_url`. The `urlquote` function is used to URL-encode the `bad_url` and `good_url`, but it does not sanitize or escape the input in a way that would prevent the execution of potentially malicious scripts.

In the `nasty_url` construction, the `bad_url` is directly included in the URL without proper validation or sanitization. This means that an attacker could craft a `bad_url` containing JavaScript code or other malicious content that, when included in the URL, could be executed by the browser when the `nasty_url` is accessed.

For example, if the `custom_column_expected` dictionary is populated with user-controlled input, and that input contains malicious JavaScript code, the `mark_safe` function will mark it as safe, and the browser will execute the JavaScript code when rendering the page. This can lead to various attacks, such as stealing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that any user-controlled input is properly sanitized and escaped before being rendered in the HTML. You can use Django's built-in template filters, such as `escape` or `escapejs`, to escape the user-controlled input before rendering it in the HTML. Additionally, you should avoid using `mark_safe` unless you are absolutely sure that the content is safe and does not contain any user-controlled input.",2919,290,12.876992464065552
