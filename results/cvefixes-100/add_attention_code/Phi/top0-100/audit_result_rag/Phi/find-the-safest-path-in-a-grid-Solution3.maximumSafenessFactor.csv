The provided Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server Side Request Forgery) as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2021-43780. The code is a simple function that makes an HTTP request to a given URL using the `requests` library and handles exceptions accordingly. There is no evidence of the code making HTTP requests to unexpected hosts or ports based on the provided code snippet.

The CWE-918 vulnerability typically involves a web server that accepts URLs from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of the URL without properly validating the destination. This can allow an attacker to bypass access controls and potentially use the server as a proxy for malicious activities.

In the provided code, the `get_response` function does not accept or process any external input to construct the URL it requests. The URL is passed as an argument to the function, and there is no indication that the function is vulnerable to SSRF based on the given code snippet.

However, it is essential to note that the security of the code can only be fully assessed in the context of the entire application, including how the `url` parameter is obtained and whether there are any other parts of the code that could introduce vulnerabilities.",2014,280,12.195309162139893

The provided code for adding security headers does not directly relate to the CWE-918 vulnerability (Server-Side Request Forgery) described in the CVE-ID CVE-202EE-0939. The security headers are intended to mitigate various web security risks such as cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and content sniffing. However, the CWE-918 vulnerability involves the web server improperly handling URLs or requests, which is not addressed by the security headers alone.

The `maximumSafenessFactor` function is a separate algorithm that calculates the maximum distance from a given cell in a grid to a cell with a value of 1. This function is unrelated to the security headers and does not introduce the CWE-918 vulnerability.

To address the CWE-918 vulnerability, you would need to ensure that the web server properly validates and sanitizes any URLs or requests it receives, and does not allow the server to be used as a proxy for accessing internal resources or conducting port scanning. This would involve implementing proper input validation, whitelisting allowed hosts, and ensuming that the server does not forward requests to unintended destinations.",1473,277,11.552970886230469

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles the `reason` parameter when generating the error response for AJAX requests. The `reason` parameter is directly passed to the `json.dumps` function without proper sanitization or escaping. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the `reason` parameter, which will then be executed by the victim's browser when the error response is displayed.

In the given code snippet, the `reason` string is encoded with `force_text` and then passed to `json.dumps`. However, the `force_text` function does not perform any escaping or sanitization of the input. This means that if an attacker can control the `reason` parameter and inject a script tag or other malicious content, it will be included in the JSON response and executed by the browser.

To fix this vulnerability, the `reason` parameter should be properly escaped or sanitized before being included in the JSON response. This can be done by using a library or function that is designed to escape or sanitize user input, ensuring that any potentially dangerous characters or scripts are neutralized before being rendered in the browser.

In the `swaggerui_static` function, the `filename` parameter is directly concatenated with the path to the `flask_restx/static` directory without any validation or sanitization. An attacker could exploit this by providing a malicious `filename` that includes relative path traversal sequences like `../` or absolute paths to access files outside of the intended directory.

For example, an attacker could pass a `filename` like `../../../../etc/passwd` to access the system's password file. This is a classic example of a path traversal attack, which is a direct consequence of improper input handling.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate the `filename` to ensure it does not contain any path traversal sequences or other unexpected characters. Additionally, it should only allow filenames that are expected and safe to be accessed.",1157,254,10.617862224578857
93,CWE-22," YES

The provided code for `swaggerui_static` is vulnerable to CWE-22, which is a path traversal vulnerability. The function takes a `filename` parameter and uses it to construct a file path by joining it with a base directory path. If an attacker can control the `filename` parameter, they could potentially supply a string that navigates the file system to access files outside of the intended directory.

For example, an attacker could pass a string like `../../../../etc/passwd` as the `filename` parameter. This would attempt to read the `/etc/passwd` file on a Unix-like system, which contains user account information. The vulnerability arises because the function does not perform any validation or sanitization on the `filename` input before using it to construct the file path.

The provided code for `swaggerui_static` is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a type of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function `send_right` is used to send a file to the client without validating the `filename` parameter. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `filename` to point to a local or remote file that the server has access to, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive files or information.

In the context of the CVE-ID CVE-2023-50266, the vulnerability is similar in that it involves the server making requests to unintended destinations based on user-controlled input. In this case, the vulnerability is due to the lack of proper validation and sanitization of the `filename` parameter, which could be exploited in a similar manner.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should implement proper input validation and sanitization for the `filename` parameter to ensure that it only points to allowed files within the expected directory. Additionally, you could consider using a whitelist approach to restrict access to specific files or directories.",1144,263,10.926345109939575

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-controlled input in the `test_custom_field_table_render` function. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `mark_safe` function from Django's template system to mark strings as safe for HTML output without proper sanitization.

In the `custom_column_expected` dictionary, the values for `boolean_field`, `url_field`, and `choice_field` contain HTML tags and attributes that are not properly escaped or sanitized. When these values are rendered in the web page, they can potentially execute malicious JavaScript code if an attacker is able to inject their own values into these fields.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that any user-controlled input is properly sanitized and escaped before being rendered in the web page. In Django, you can use the `escape` function from the `django.utils.html` module to escape any HTML tags and attributes in the user-controlled input.

Here's an example of how you can modify the `test_custom_field_table_render` function to sanitize the user-controlled input:

```python
from django.utils.html import escape

def test_custom_field_table_render(self):
    queryset = Location",2741,301,13.27316951751709

The provided code snippet for `convert_bookformat` does not exhibit the vulnerability described by CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery). The function takes `book_id` and `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` as input, which are obtained from the request form. It then logs the conversion attempt and calls a helper function to perform the actual conversion. There is no evidence of the code processing or executing any external URLs or requests based on user input, which would be necessary for a CWE-918 vulnerability.

The second function `maximumSafenessFactor` is unrelated to the `convert_bookformat` function and is a separate algorithm for finding the maximum safety factor in a grid. It does not involve any web request handling or URL processing, so it is not relevant to the CWE-918 vulnerability either.

Therefore, based on the provided code, there is no indication of a CWE-918 vulnerability.",1619,223,9.437670946121216
