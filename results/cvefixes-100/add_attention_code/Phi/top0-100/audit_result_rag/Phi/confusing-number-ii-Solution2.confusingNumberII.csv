The provided code snippet for the `get_response` function does not exhibit the vulnerability described by CWE-918, which involves improper handling of URLs that could lead to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The function `get_response` is designed to make HTTP requests using the `requests` library, and it does not directly handle or manipulate URLs in a way that would allow an attacker to control the destination of the request.

The vulnerability described in CWE-918 typically involves a scenario where an application constructs a URL based on user input without proper validation, which could allow an attacker to inject a malicious URL that the server would then access. In the provided code, the `url` parameter is passed directly to the `requests_session.request` method, and there is no indication that the `url` is being constructed from untrusted input or that it is being modified in any way that could lead to SSRF.

Therefore, based on the provided code snippet, the `get_response` function is not vulnerable to the CWE-918 issue as described. However, it is important to note that without the full context of how the `url` parameter is obtained and used throughout the application, it is not possible to definitively rule out all potential vulnerabilities related to URL handling.",2307,291,13.354631423950195

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it handles the `next` parameter in the URL. The `next` parameter is used to redirect the user after a successful login. An attacker can manipulate this parameter to redirect the user to a malicious URL after a successful login. This is a type of open redirect vulnerability.

In the code, the `nasty_url` is constructed by appending the `next` parameter to the login URL. The value of the `next` parameter is taken from the `bad_url` list, which contains potentially malicious URLs. The `urlquote` function is used to URL-encode the `bad_url`, but this does not prevent the vulnerability.

An attacker can craft a request with a `next` parameter pointing to a malicious URL, and if the server accepts this parameter without proper validation, the user will be redirected to the attacker's site after a successful login. This can lead to phishing attacks or other malicious activities.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the `next` parameter to ensure it only contains URLs that the application controls or trusts. This can be done by maintaining a whitelist of allowed URLs and checking if the `next` parameter matches any of the URLs in the whitelist.",3151,282,13.166074514389038

The provided Python code is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a type of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles the URL for the Dropbox file retrieval.

In the `get_file` function, the code replaces 'www.dropbox.' with 'dl.dropboxusercontent.' in the `recipe.link` URL before making the request. This replacement is done without any validation or sanitization of the input URL. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `recipe.link` to point to an internal or unexpected host, causing the server to send requests to unintended destinations.

For example, an attacker could set `recipe.right` to a URL like `http://internal-server:8080/secret-data`, and the code would replace it with `http://dl.dropboxusercontent.internal-server:8080/secret-data`. The server would then attempt to retrieve content from this internal server, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information.

The provided Python code for `swaggerui_static` is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a type of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function takes a filename as an input and uses it to construct a file path to retrieve static files from the server's file system. If an attacker can control the filename parameter, they could potentially craft a path that leads to unauthorized access to the server's file system or even to other internal resources.

The `swaggerui_static` function does not perform any validation on the `filename` parameter to ensure it is a legitimate static file name and not a malicious path.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the function should validate the `filename` parameter to ensure it only contains expected characters and does not contain any directory traversal sequences (like ""../"") that could lead to unauthorized file access.

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-controlled input in the `test_custom_field_table_render` function. The `LocationTable` class is likely to render HTML content based on the `custom_column_expected` dictionary values, which contain HTML tags and attributes. If an attacker can manipulate the values in `custom_column_expected`, they could inject malicious scripts that would be executed when the `LocationTable` is rendered in the browser.

For example, if an attacker can control the value of `custom_column_expected[""url_field""]`, they could change it to something like:

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that any user-controlled input is properly sanitized and escaped before being rendered in the browser. This can be done by using templating engines that automatically escape content or by manually escaping the content using functions like `escape` or `html.escape` in Python.
