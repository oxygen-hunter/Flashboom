The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-918, Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses the `requests` library to make HTTP requests to URLs without validating or sanitizing the input. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `url` parameter to point to an internal or unintended destination, causing the server to make requests to those locations. This could lead to unauthorized access to internal resources or bypassing of security controls.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the `url` parameter before making the request. This can be done by ensuring that the URL is within a whitelist of allowed domains or by using a library that supports URL validation and sanitization. Additionally, the code should handle exceptions and errors gracefully to prevent information leakage.",2097,192,8.588666915893555

17,CWE-918," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in the code is related to the handling of user input without proper validation and sanitization. Specifically, the code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.

In the `change_profile` function, the code retrieves user input from the `request.form.to_dict()` method and uses it to update the user's profile information. The user input is directly used to update the user's email, kindle_mail, name, and other profile fields without proper validation and sanitization.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious request that includes unexpected URLs or other data, which the server will then process and use to update the user's profile. This can lead to unauthorized access to internal resources, bypassing of access controls, and other security issues.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques to ensure that only expected and safe data is processed. Additionally, the code should implement proper access controls and security measures to prevent unauthorized access to internal resources.",2892,250,11.21701693534851

The vulnerability in the code is not related to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2022-0990. Instead, the vulnerability in the provided code is related to the handling of user input without proper validation and sanitization, which can lead to security issues such as SQL Injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

In the code, the `change_profile` function takes user input from `request.form.to_dict()` and directly uses it to update the user's profile information. The code does not perform any validation or sanitization on the input values before updating the database. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious code or commands, which can lead to unauthorized access or data manipulation.

To fix this vulnerability, you should validate and sanitize the user input before updating the database. You can use libraries like WTForms or Django's built-in form validation to validate the input data. Additionally, you should use parameterized queries or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to prevent SQL Injection attacks.

Here's an example of how you can validate and sanitize the user input using WTForms:

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `urlquote` function is used to sanitize the `bad_url` and `good_url` variables before they are included in the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` strings. The `urlquote` function is intended to encode special characters in URLs to prevent XSS attacks. However, the code does not properly handle the case where the `bad_url` or `good_url` contains JavaScript event handlers or other malicious content that could be executed by the browser.

For example, if an attacker can control the `bad_url` or `good_url` input, they could craft a URL that includes JavaScript code within the query parameters. When the `nasty_url` or `safe_url` is constructed and the `client.post` method is called, the browser will execute the JavaScript code, leading to an XSS attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the `urlquote` function should be replaced with a more robust method of sanitizing user input, such as using Django's built-in `escape` function or a similar method that properly encodes or removes potentially dangerous content. Additionally, the code should ensure that any user-supplied URLs are not directly included in the generated URLs without proper validation and sanitization",2941,301,13.307505130767822

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a type of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles the URL for the Dropbox file retrieval. The code replaces 'www.dropbox.' with 'dl.dropboxusercontent.' in the `recipe.link` URL before making the request. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `recipe.link` to point to an internal or sensitive resource on the server or another server that the application has access to.

For example, an attacker could craft a `recipe.right` that looks like this:

```
http://internal-server/sensitive-data

When the code replaces 'www.dropbox.' with 'dl.dropboxusercontent.', the resulting URL would be:

```
http://dl.dropboxusercontent.internal-server/sensitive-data

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it constructs the command line arguments for the `ansible-runner` command. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the concatenation of user-supplied input (`plugin_names`) directly into the command line without proper escaping or validation. This can lead to command injection attacks if an attacker provides specially crafted input that manipulates the intended command execution.

In the `prepare_plugin_docs_command` function, the `plugin_names` list is joined into a single string and appended to the `cmdline_args` list, which is then used to construct the final command to be executed. If an attacker can control the contents of `plugin_names`, they could potentially inject additional commands or alter the intended behavior of the `ansible-runner` command.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to validate and sanitize the `plugin_names` input, ensuring that it only contains valid plugin names and does not contain any characters or patterns that could be used for command injection. Additionally, using a safer method to construct the command, such as using the `subprocess` module with argument lists instead of a single string, can help prevent command injection attacks.",1937,269,11.625901937484741

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-601, which is an issue related to open redirects. In the context of the given code, the vulnerability arises from the use of `request.POST.get('next', topic.get_url())` in the `redirect` function. This line of code takes a 'next' parameter from the POST data and uses it to redirect the user. If an attacker can control the 'next' parameter, they could redirect the user to a malicious site, leading to a phishing attack.

The vulnerability is present because the code does not validate or sanitize the 'next' parameter before using it in the redirect. An attacker could craft a request with a malicious URL in the 'next' parameter, and the application would redirect the user to that URL without any checks.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate the 'next' parameter against a whitelist of allowed URLs or ensure that it only redirects to URLs within the same domain.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `exec()` function, which executes the code passed to it as a string. In this case, the code being executed is retrieved from an external source using `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`. This means that an attacker could potentially provide malicious code as the content of the ""bs-extensions"" file, leading to a CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command) vulnerability.

In the context of this code, the attacker could manipulate the content of the ""bs-extensions"" file to include OS command injection, which would allow them to execute arbitrary commands on the system where the code is running. This could lead to unautrighted access, data theft, or other malicious activities.

To fix this vulnerability, you should avoid using `exec()` to execute code from external sources. Instead, consider using safer alternatives like `eval()` with a limited scope or implementing a whitelist of allowed commands and sanitizing the input before execution.",1502,248,10.390756368637085

In the context of the provided code, the `load` function retrieves a file named ""bs-extensions"" using the `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile` function and then executes the contents of that file using `exec(code, globals())`. If an attacker can control the contents of the ""bsEExtensions"" file, they could inject malicious code that would be executed by the `exec` function, leading to potential security breaches.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should avoid using `exec` to execute code from untrusted sources.

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-352, which is a vulnerability where the web application does not sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request. In the context of the provided code, the vulnerability arises from the use of the `json.loads` function without proper validation of the input data.

The code uses a `patch` to simulate an error when parsing the JSON body of a POST request. This is done by setting the `side_effect` of the `json.loads` function to raise an `Exception`. However, this does not actually validate the input data or ensure that it is well-formed and consistent. An attacker could potentially exploit this by sending malformed or unexpected data in the request body, which could lead to unintended behavior or errors in the application.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should include proper input validation and error handling mechanisms to ensure that the input data is well-formed, valid, and consistent. This could involve checking the content-type header, validating the JSON structure, and handling errors gracefully. Additionally, it is recommended to use a more secure and robust JSON parsing library, such as `orjson` or `ujson`, which can provide better error handling and performance.",1806,284,12.063886404037476

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-835, which is an infinite loop condition. The vulnerability arises from the `while self._buffer` loop in the `data_right` method. If an attacker sends data that never satisfies the exit conditions of the loop, the server could enter an infinite loop, consuming excessive resources such as CPU or memory. This could potentially lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

In the `data_right` method, the loop continues as long as `self._buffer` is not empty. However, the code does not guarantee that the buffer will be emptied in a finite number of iterations. If the incoming data is malformed or crafted in a way that the parsing logic never succeeds, the loop will continue indefinitely, leading to a vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the loop has a well-defined exit condition that can be reached in a finite number of iterations, even in the presence of malformed or unexpected input.",1376,226,9.487584114074707

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles the `reason` parameter when generating the error response. The `reason` parameter is directly passed to the `json.dumps` function without proper sanitization or encoding, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the error message.

In the case of an AJAX request, the error message is returned as a JSON response with the `reason` parameter included. If an attacker can control the `reason` parameter, they could inject a script that would be executed by the client's browser when the error message is displayed.

To fix this vulnerability, the `reason` parameter should be properly encoded or sanitized before being included in the JSON response. This can be done using functions like `escape` or `html.escape` to ensure that any potentially dangerous characters are properly escaped.

The provided Python code for `swaggerui_static` is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a type of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises because the function `send_file` is used to send a file to the client without validating the `filename` parameter. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `filename` parameter to cause the server to retrieve content from an unintended location, such as internal network resources or other external services.

In the context of the CVE-ID CVE-2023-50266, the vulnerability is similar in that it involves the server making a request to an unintended destination based on user-controlled input. The `swaggerui_static` function does not perform any validation or sanitization on the `filename` parameter, which could lead to an SSRF attack if an attacker is able to control the value of `filename`.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `swaggerui_static` function should validate the `filename` parameter against a whitelist of allowed filenames or patterns, ensuring that only legitimate and expected files are served to the client. Additionally, implementing proper access controls and ensuring that the server's file retrieval functionality is not exposed to the public internet can help reduce the risk of SSRF attacks.",1227,301,12.506707191467285
95,CWE-79," YES

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-generated content in the `custom_column_expected` dictionary. The values in this dictionary are hardcoded strings that could potentially contain malicious JavaScript or HTML content. If these values are directly rendered to the browser without proper sanitization, they could be executed as scripts, leading to an XSS attack.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that any user-generated content is properly escaped or sanitized before being rendered to the browser. You can use Django's built-in template system or the `mark_safe` function from `django.utils.safestring` to safely render user-generated content.",2824,159,7.372490167617798

The provided code snippet for `convert_bookformat` does not exhibit the vulnerability described by CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery). The function takes form data for book conversion, checks if the necessary fields are present, logs the conversion attempt, and then calls a helper function to perform the conversion. There is no evidence of the code processing or executing external URLs or requests based on user input, which would be necessary for a CWE-918 vulnerability to exist.",1702,108,4.789572477340698
