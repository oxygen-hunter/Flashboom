25,CWE-918," YES

The provided code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `search` parameter is used in the `calibre_db.get_search_results` function call. If the `search` parameter is directly included in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterized queries, an attacker could manipulate the input to alter the intended SQL command.

For example, if the `search` parameter is used in a query like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE '%' || :search || '%';
```

An attacker could provide a `search` value like `'; DROP TABLE books; --`, which would result in the following SQL command being executed:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE '%'; DROP TABLE books; --%'
```

This would cause the database to drop the `books` table, leading to data loss.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use parameterized queries or prepared statements to ensure that user input is properly sanitized and treated as data, not as part of the SQL command.",4006,241,11.76298975944519
26,CWE-918," YES

The provided code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `sort_param` and `order` parameters are used to construct SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterized queries.

In the `if` and `elif` blocks, the code constructs SQL queries using string concatenation with the `sort_param` and `order` values directly. For example:

```python
order = [db.Tags.name.asc()] if order == ""asc"" else [db.Tags.name.desc()]
join = db.books_tags_link, db.Books.id == db.books_tags_link.c.book, db.Tags
```

If an attacker can control the `sort_param` or `order` values, they can inject malicious SQL code into the query, which can lead to unauthorized data access, data manipulation, or even complete control over the database.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use parameterized queries or prepared statements to ensure that user input is properly sanitized and treated as data, not as part of the SQL command. This can be achieved by using SQLAlchemy's built-in query API, which automatically handles parameterization and prevents SQL injection attacks.

Here's an example of how you can use parameterized queries to fix the vulnerability",4006,301,14.167789459228516

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, specifically Type 1 (Reflected XSS). The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles user-controlled input (the `bad_url` and `good_url` variables) and reflects it back in the HTTP response without proper sanitization or encoding.

In the `test_security_check` function, the `nasty_url` and `safe_url` variables are constructed by concatenating user-controlled input (`bad_url` and `good_url`) with other parts of the URL. This user-controlled input is then used in the `self.client.post` method, which simulates a POST request to the server.

If an attacker can manipulate the `bad_url` or `good_url` variables to include malicious JavaScript code, the server may reflect this code back in the HTTP response. When a victim visits the generated URL, the malicious script will be executed in the context of the web server, potentially leading to XSS attacks.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly sanitize and encode user-controlled input before using it in the URL construction. Additionally, the server should implement proper output encoding and content security policies to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks.",2681,293,13.607335805892944

The provided code for the function `sumOddLengthSubarrays` is not vulnerable to the CWE-ID CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery) described in the CVE-ID CVE-2022-0339. The function is a pure Python function that calculates the sum of odd-length subarrays for a given array of integers. It does not involve any web server operations, URL handling, or network requests that could be exploited for SSRF attacks.

The function uses a mathematical approach to calculate the number of odd-length subarrays that contain each element in the input array. It does not interact with any external systems or resources, and it does not process any user-supplied input that could be used to construct a malicious request. Therefore, it is not susceptible to the vulnerability described in the CVE-ID CVE-2022-0339.",2098,209,9.76182508468628

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-918, Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the way the code modifies the `recipe.link` URL before making the HTTP GET request. By replacing 'www.dropbox.' with 'dl.dropboxusercontent.', the code potentially allows an attacker to manipulate the URL to point to any server that the web server has access to. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or other servers within the network that the web server can reach.

For example, an attacker could craft a URL that points to an internal service or file that they should not have access to, and the web server would retrieve the content of that URL, effectively bypassing access controls. This is because the code does not validate or whitelist the URLs it accepts, making it susceptible to SSRF attacks.",966,198,8.61090874671936

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it handles authentication tokens. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the code does not properly validate the expiration of the token. This can lead to a situation where an attacker can reuse an expired token to gain unauthorized access to the system.

In the code, the `authenticate` method creates a new token for the user and tenant, but it does not check if the token is expired or not. This means that an attacker can use an expired token to authenticate and gain access to the system.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check the expiration of the token before creating a new one. This can be done by adding an expiration time to the token and checking it during the authentication process. If the token is expired, the code should return an error and not create a new token.

Here's an example of how the code can be modified to include token expiration:

```python
import time

class Token:
    def __init__(self, user_id, tenant_id, expiration_time):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.tenant_id = tenant_id

The provided code snippet does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery) as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2021-32677. The code is a test function for a web application that sends POST requests with different payloads to a server endpoint. The vulnerability described in CVE-2021-32677 is specific to FastAPI versions lower than 0.65.2, where the application would accept JSON data with a content-type of text/plain, potentially leading to CSRF attacks.

The provided code snippet does not have any issues related to content-type handling or CSRF vulnerabilities. It sends JSON data with the correct content-type header (`json={""test"": ""test2""}`) and checks for the expected response status code and JSON response.

However, it is essential to note that the code snippet is not complete, and the actual vulnerability may exist elsewhere in the application. It is always recommended to review the entire application and follow secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities.",1546,242,10.664462566375732

The provided code snippet for `data_received` does not exhibit the vulnerability described by CWE-835 (Unreachable Code) in the context of the CVE-2023-26151. The loop in the `data_received` function is controlled by the condition `while self._buffer:` which ensures that the loop will continue as long as there is data in the buffer. The loop exits when `self._buffer` is empty, which is a reachable condition. The code also handles exceptions and logs them, which prevents the infinite loop scenario described in the CVE.

However, the `sumOddLengthSubarrays` function is not related to the `data_received` function and does not contain any iteration or loop that could potentially be an infinite loop. It is a separate function that calculates the sum of odd-length subarrays for a given array, and it does not have any direct impact on the `data_received` function's vulnerability.",1116,224,9.832539558410645

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles the `reason` parameter when generating the error response. The `reason` parameter is directly included in the JSON response without proper escaping or sanitization. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the error message, which could be executed by the user's browser when they view the error page.

In the code snippet, the `reason` string is passed to the `json.dumps` function, which will escape some characters but not all potential XSS vectors. For example, if the `reason` parameter contains a script tag or other malicious content, it could be executed by the user's browser when they view the error page.

To fix this vulnerability, the `reason` parameter should be properly escaped or sanitized before being included in the error response. This can be done using a library or function that is specifically designed to escape or sanitize user-controlled input, such as `escape` or `html` from the `django.utils.html` module in Django.

Here's an example of how to fix the vulnerability:

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-controlled input in the `LocationTable` object. The `LocationTable` object likely renders HTML content based on the `custom_column_expected` dictionary values, which contain HTML tags and attributes. If the `LocationTable` object does not properly sanitize or escape this user-controlled input before rendering it to the web page, it could lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

For example, the `url_field` key in the `custom_column_expected` dictionary contains an HTML anchor tag with an `href` attribute. If the `LocationTable` object does not escape or sanitize this input before rendering it, an attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into the `href` attribute, leading to an XSS attack.

To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the `LocationTable` object properly escapes or sanitizes all user-controlled input before rendering it to the web page. This can be achieved by using a library or framework that automatically handles input sanitization and escaping, or by implementing custom sanitization and escaping functions.",2564,256,11.94153118133545
