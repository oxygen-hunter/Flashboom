1,CWE-918," YES

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is related to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses the `requests_session.request` method to send a request to a given URL without validating or sanitizing the input URL. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `url` parameter to point to an internal or unintended destination, causing the server to make requests to those destinations on behalf of the attacker.

This could lead to unautptaen access to internal resources, bypassing firewalls, or even using the server as a proxy for other malicious activities. The vulnerability is present because the code does not implement any checks to ensure that the URL is pointing to an expected and safe destination before making the request.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should include validation of the `url` parameter to ensure it only allows requests to intended and safe destinations. This could involve checking against a whitelist of allowed domains, ensuring the URL uses a secure scheme (like HTTPS), or implementing other security checks to prevent SSRF attacks.",2000,252,11.035456657409668

The provided Python code is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is related to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses `socket.gethostbyname(hostname)` to resolve the hostname to an IP address. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `url` parameter to point to an internal or unexpected server, causing the server to make a request to an unintended destination. This could lead to information disclosure or other security issues if the server is used as a proxy to access internal resources.

The code does not perform any validation or whitelisting of the input URL, which means that it trusts the input and will attempt to resolve any hostname provided. This is a classic example of SSRF vulnerability, where the server is tricked into making requests to unintended destinations.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate the input URL to ensure it only allows requests to expected and safe destinations. Additionally, using a more secure method to resolve hostnames, such as DNSSEC, can help prevent DNS spoofing attacks that could lead to SSRF.",1370,254,10.621207475662231

The provided code is vulnerable to a timing attack, which is a form of side-channel attack where an attacker can infer information about the internal state of a system by measuring the time it takes to execute certain operations. In the context of the `gateway_postprocess` function, the vulnerability arises from the conditional checks and the subsequent operations that depend on the `transaction_kind`.

The code contains multiple branches that are executed based on the value of `transaction_kind`. If an attacker can repeatedly call the `gateway_postprocess` function with different `transaction_kind` values and measure the time it takes for the function to execute, they may be able to deduce the internal state of the system or the value of `transaction_kind`. This is because the execution time may vary depending on which branch is taken and the operations performed within that branch.

For example, the code updates the `payment.charge_status` and performs a `payment.save()` call only if certain conditions are met. The time it takes to execute these operations may differ based on the current state of the `payment` object and the `transaction_kind`. An attacker could potentially use this timing information to learn about the state of the `payment` object or the `transaction_kind`, which could lead to further exploitation.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to ensure that the execution time of",2009,301,13.020410299301147

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `is_safe_url` function handles the `next` parameter in the URL. The function uses `urlquote` to sanitize the `bad_url` and `good_url` variables, but it does not properly sanitize the `next` parameter that is appended to the login URL.

In the `test_security_check` function, the `next` parameter is set to a URL that includes the `bad_url` or `good_url` variable. This means that an attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into the `bad_url` or `good_url` variables, which would then be included in the `next` parameter of the URL. When the user is redirected to this URL, the malicious JavaScript code would be executed in the user's browser, leading to an XSS attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the `is_safe_url` function should properly sanitize the `next` parameter by encoding or validating it to ensure that it only contains safe characters and does not contain any malicious code.

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a type of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles the URL for the Dropbox file retrieval. The code replaces 'www.dropbox.' with 'dl.dropboxusercontent.' in the `recipe.link` URL before making the request. This replacement is done without any validation or sanitization of the input URL.

An attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious `recipe.link` that points to a different server or a local file on the server's file system. For example, an attacker could set `recipe.right` to a URL that points to a local file on the server, such as `file:///etc/passwd`, which could potentially expose sensitive information.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the `recipe.link` URL before making the request. This could involve checking that the URL is a valid Dropbox link and does not contain any unexpected or malicious components. Additionally, the server should not be used as a proxy for accessing local files or other internal resources without proper authorization and validation.",1129,268,11.133816003799438

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it constructs the command line arguments for execution. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the concatenation of user-controlled input (`plugin_names`) directly into the command line without proper escaping or sanitization. This can lead to command injection attacks if an attacker provides specially crafted input.

In the `prepare_plugin_docs_command` function, the `plugin_names` list is joined into a single string and appended to the `cmdline_args` list, which is then used to construct the final command to be executed. If an attacker can control the contents of `plugin_names`, they could potentially inject additional shell commands to be executed.

For example, if an attacker provides a `plugin_names` value like `['plugin1', '; rm -rf /']`, the resulting command would be:

```
[self._ansible_doc_exec_path] -j -s -t plugin1 ; rm -rf /
```

This would execute the intended command to retrieve documentation for `plugin1` and then execute the `rm -rf /` command, which could delete all files in the root directory of the system.

The provided Python code is vulnerable due to the use of the `exec` function, which executes a string of code. This is a classic example of a CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command, which can lead to OS Command Injection vulnerabilities. In the `load` function, the `exec` function is used to execute code that is retrieved from an external source (`config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`). If an attacker can control the content of the file being loaded, they could inject malicious code that would be executed by the `exec` function.

This vulnerability is similar to the CVE-ID CVE-2021-23422, where an untrusted source file containing Inline Tag Command metadata is processed, and when an arbitrary OS command is executed, the command output would be included in the HTML output. In this case, the `exec` function could be used to execute arbitrary commands, leading to a similar type of vulnerability.",1405,233,9.791775941848755

The provided Python code is vulnerable due to the use of the `exec` function, which executes the code passed to it as a string. This can be a significant security risk if the code being executed is derived from an untrusted source, as it can lead to arbitrary code execution. In the context of CWE-22 (Path Traversal), while the provided code snippet does not directly demonstrate path traversal, the use of `exec` with external input (in this case, `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`) can potentially lead to a situation where an attacker could manipulate the input to execute arbitrary code, which is a form of code injection vulnerability.

The CWE-22 description you provided talks about path traversal, which is a different kind of vulnerability where an attacker can access files outside the intended directory by using special path elements. While the code snippet you've provided does not directly show path traversal, the use of `exec` with external input can lead to similar risks if the input is not properly sanitized and validated.

In summary, the vulnerability in the provided code is not CWE-22 (Path Traversal) but rather a potential for arbitrary code execution due to the use of `exec` with external input, which is a common security issue in many programming languages.",1052,296,12.326372861862183

The provided Python code for `test_post_broken_body` is not vulnerable to CWE-352 as described. The code is testing the behavior of a web server when it receives JSON data in the request body. The vulnerability described in CWE-352 involves the server not verifying the intent of the request, which is not the case here. The code is simply testing the server's response to different JSON payloads and ensuring that the server correctly handles JSON parsing errors.",1709,110,4.850656509399414

The provided code snippet for `data_received` is not directly vulnerable to CWE-835 (Unreachable Code) as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2023-26151. The loop in the `data_received` function is designed to continuously process incoming data until there is no more data to process (`while self._buffer:`), which means the exit condition of the loop is based on the state of `self._buffer`. As long as `self._buffer` is not empty, the loop will continue to execute, making the loop's exit condition reachable.

However, it's important to note that the vulnerability mentioned in the CVE-ID CVE-2023-26151 is specific to versions of the `asyncua` package before 0.9.96, where an infinite loop could be caused by a malformed packet. This vulnerability is not directly related to the provided `data_received` function but rather to the handling of malformed packets in the `asyncua` package.

In the context of the provided `data_received` function, if the `NotEnoughData` exception is raised, the function will log the error and return, which means the loop will exit. This behavior ensures that the loop's exit condition is reachable.

The provided Python code for `backup_download` is vulnerable to CWE-22, which is an issue related to uncontrolled file access. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function takes a `filename` parameter, which is used to construct a file path by joining it with a directory path from the `settings.backup.folder`. If an attacker can control the `filename` input, they could potentially manipulate the path to access files outside of the intended `settings.backup.folder` directory.

For example, an attacker could provide a filename like `../../etc/passwd` as an argument to the `backup_download` function. This would result in the function attempting to access the `/etc/passwd` file on the system, which is outside of the `settings.backup.folder` directory. This is a classic example of a path traversal attack, where the attacker uses special directory traversal sequences (like `../`) to navigate the file system and access files that should not be accessible through the application.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should sanitize the `filename` input to ensure that it does not contain any directory traversal sequences or other special characters that could lead to unauthorized file access. This can be done by implementing a whitelist of allowed characters, using regular expressions to validate the input, or by using",1103,301,12.424501180648804

The provided Python code for `backup_download` is vulnerable to CWE-22, which is an issue related to uncontrolled format string vulnerabilities. However, the description of the vulnerability in the context of the code snippet seems to be more related to path traversal issues, which is CWE-20.

The `backup_download` function takes a `filename` parameter and uses it to construct a file path by joining it with a predefined folder path from the `settings.backup.folder`. If the `filename` parameter is not properly sanitized and validated, an attacker could provide a malicious filename that includes path traversal sequences like ""../"" or absolute paths to access files outside the intended directory.

For example, if an attacker passes a filename like ""../etc/passwd"" to the `backup_download` function, and if the application does not properly handle this input, it could potentially read sensitive files from the system.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should validate and sanitize the `filename` input to ensure that it does not contain any path traversal sequences or other malicious content. This can be done by using secure functions for file path manipulation and by implementing strict input validation checks.",1095,275,11.443075180053711

The provided Python code for `backup_download` is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a blind server-side request forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises because the function `send_file` is used to send a file to the client without validating the `filename` parameter. If an attacker can control the `filename` parameter, they could potentially craft a request that causes the server to retrieve a file from an unintended location, such as an internal server or an external resource.

In the context of the CVE-ID CVE-2023-50266, the vulnerability is similar in that it involves the server retrieving content from a URL that may not be properly validated, leading to potential SSRF attacks. The `backup_download` function does not show any validation or sanitization of the `filename` parameter, which could be used to construct a URL or file path that the server would then attempt to retrieve.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `backup_download` function should include proper validation and sanitization of the `filename` parameter to ensure that it only allows access to files within the intended directory and does not allow for any external or internal server file retrieval.",1090,276,11.463234901428223
92,CWE-22," YES

The provided code is vulnerable to path traversal attacks, which is a type of security vulnerability where an attacker can read or write files on the filesystem that they should not have access to. This is due to the way the `filename` parameter is used in the `send_file` function without proper validation or sanitization.

In the `swaggerui_static` function, the `filename` parameter is directly concatenated with the path to the static files directory. An attacker could potentially pass a string like `../../../../etc/passwd` as the `filename` argument, which would cause the function to attempt to read the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file on a Unix-like system.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should validate the `filename` parameter to ensure it does not contain any path traversal sequences (like `../`) or other unexpected characters before using it to construct the file path. Additionally, you could use a whitelist approach to only allow specific file names or patterns to be accessed.",1143,224,9.341407060623169

The provided code is vulnerable to path traversal attacks, which is a type of security vulnerability where an attacker can read or write files on the filesystem that they should not have access to. This is due to the fact that the `filename` parameter is directly used to construct a file path without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially supply a string like ""../"" or ""../../../../etc/passwd"" to navigate to directories and access sensitive files outside of the intended directory.

In the context of the CWE-22 description, the vulnerability arises because the code does not neutralize special elements within the `filename` pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location outside of the restricted directory. The `send_file` function in Flask is used to send files from the server to the client, and if an attacker can control the `filename` parameter, they can potentially access any file on the server that the application has permission to read.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should validate the `filename` parameter to ensure it only contains expected characters and does not contain any path traversal sequences. Additionally, the application should ensure that the resolved file path is within the expected directory.",1135,264,10.988239765167236

The provided Python code for `swaggerui_static` is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a type of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises because the function `send_file` is used to send a file to the client without validating the `filename` parameter. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `filename` parameter to cause the server to retrieve content from an unintended destination, effectively using the server as a proxy.

In the context of the CVE-ID CVE-2023-50266, the vulnerability is similar in that it involves the server making a request to an unintended destination based on user-controlled input. The `swaggerui_static` function does not perform any checks on the `filename` parameter to ensure it is a valid and safe file path. This could allow an attacker to craft a `filename` that points to a different resource, potentially leading to information disclosure or other security issues.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `swaggerui_static` function should validate the `filename` parameter to ensure it only points to allowed files within the expected directory. Additionally, implementing a whitelist of allowed file paths or using a more secure method to serve static files would help prevent this type of vulnerability.",1130,291,12.064167261123657

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-controlled input in the `test_custom_field_table_render` function. The vulnerability arises from the use of `mark_safe` in Django's template system, which is not shown in the provided code snippet but is implied by the context.

The `mark_safe` function is used to mark a string as safe (i.e., not requiring further HTML escaping) in Django templates. If `mark_safe` is used to mark user-controlled input as safe without proper sanitization, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

In the `test_custom_field_table_render` function, the `custom_column_expected` dictionary contains values that are HTML-formatted strings. If these values are derived from user input or contain user-controlled data, and `mark_safe` is used to mark them as safe without proper sanitization, it could lead to XSS attacks.

To fix this vulnerability, ensure that any user-controlled input is properly sanitized before being marked as safe. This can be done by using Django's built-in escaping functions or by implementing custom sanitization logic to remove or escape any potentially malicious content.
