The provided Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 (Server Side Request Forgery) as described in the CVE-ID CVE-2021-43780. The code is a simple function that retrieves a response from a URL using the `requests` library and handles exceptions accordingly. It does not involve any direct handling of user-supplied URLs or data that could be used to forge requests to other servers.

The CWE-918 vulnerability typically involves a web application that accepts user input to construct a URL or request that is then used to make a server-side call to an external service. The vulnerability occurs when the application does not properly validate or sanitize the user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious URLs or parameters that can lead to unauthorized access or data leakage.

In the provided code, the `url` parameter is not directly derived from user input, and there is no evidence of user input being used to construct the request. Additionally, the code does not expose any internal server details or configuration that could be used to exploit the vulnerability.

The vulnerability lies in the way the `test_security_check` function handles the `bad_url` and `good_url` parameters when constructing the `nasty_url` and `safe_url`. The `urlquote` function is used to URL-encode the `bad_url` and `good_url`, but it does not sanitize the input to ensure that it does not contain any malicious scripts.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL that contains JavaScript code or other executable content.

If an attacker can control the `filename` input, they could potentially manipulate the path to access files outside of the intended `settings.backup.folder` directory. This is a classic example of a path traversal attack, where special elements like ""../"" can be used to navigate up the directory tree and access files that should not be accessible.

To fix this vulnerability, the `filename` input should be properly validated and sanitized before being used to construct the file path. This could involve checking that the filename does not contain any special characters or sequences that could lead to path traversal, or using a whitelist approach to only allow certain characters or patterns in the filename.",1238,259,11.234593152999878

The provided Python code is vulnerable to path traversal attacks, specifically CWE-22 (Path Traversal). The vulnerability arises from the way the `swaggerui_static` function constructs a file path using the `filename` parameter, which is provided by the user. If an attacker can control the `filename` parameter, they could potentially include special directory traversal sequences like ""../"" to access files outside of the intended directory.

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-supplied data in the `LocationTable` rendering. The vulnerability arises from the use of Django's `mark_safe()` function, which is not used in the given code but is mentioned in the context of the vulnerability.

The `LocationTable` class is expected to render custom fields, and the code snippet shows an example of how custom fields are expected to be rendered. However, the vulnerability lies in the fact that the `LocationTable` class may not properly escape or sanitize the user-supplied data before rendering it in the HTML.

If the `LocationTable` class uses `mark_safe()` or similar functions to mark the rendered content as safe HTML without proper sanitization, it could lead to XSS attacks. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the custom fields, which would be rendered and executed by the browser when the page is loaded.

To fix this vulnerability, the `LocationTable` class should ensure that all user-supplied data is properly escaped or sanitized before rendering it in the HTML. This can be achieved by using Django's built-in template filters, such as `escape` or `format_html`, to safely render the content.

In summary, the code is vulnerable to XSS due to the potential",2862,301,13.87619137763977
