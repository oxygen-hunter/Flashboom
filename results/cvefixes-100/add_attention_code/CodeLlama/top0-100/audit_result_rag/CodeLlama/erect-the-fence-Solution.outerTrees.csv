1,CWE-918,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

The vulnerability is caused by the `requests_session.request()` method, which allows an attacker to send a request to any URL they want, potentially bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly.

The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker provides a URL that is not a valid URL, but rather a URL that is not accessible from the outside world, such as a private IP address. The `is_private_address()` function is used to check if the URL is a private address, and if it is, the code raises an exception. However, this does not prevent the attacker from sending a request to the private address, which could potentially bypass the access control.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the URL is a valid URL and that it is accessible from the outside world before sending the request. Additionally, the code should not allow the attacker to provide a URL that is not a valid URL, but rather should raise an exception if the URL is not a valid URL.",1929,250,9.781355381011963

9,CWE-918,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to CWE-918.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `filter` method in the `adv_search_serie` function. The `filter` method takes a predicate function as an argument, which is applied to each element in the iterable. In this case, the predicate function is `db.Books.series.any(db.Series.id == serie)`.

The vulnerability arises because the `any` method is used to check if any element in the `db.Books.series` collection satisfies the condition `db.Series.id == serie`. However, this method does not ensure that the condition is applied to the correct collection. In other words, it is possible for an attacker to manipulate the `db.Series.id` field to bypass the intended filter and access unauthorized data.

To fix this vulnerability, the `any` method should be replaced with a more secure method that ensures the condition is applied to the correct collection. One possible solution is to use the `all` method, which checks if all elements in the collection satisfy the condition. Another solution is to use a more secure method such as `filter_by` or `filter_by_id` that ensures the condition is applied to the correct collection.",1052,283,10.692821502685547

However, if the points are collinear, the cross product will be zero, and the function will not be able to determine the orientation of the points.

In the `outerTrees` function, the `cross` function is used to calculate the orientation of the vectors.

For example, an attacker could send a request with a modified `next` parameter that contains a malicious URL, such as `http://www.maliciouswebsite.com`. When the `redirect` function is called with this modified `next` parameter, the user will be redirected to the malicious website, potentially leading to a phishing attack.

90,CWE-22,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to CWE-22. The `outerTrees` function uses the `cross` function to determine the orientation of the points in the convex hull. However, the `cross` function does not properly neutralize special elements in the pathname, which can cause the pathname to resolve to a location outside of the restricted directory. This can lead to an arbitrary file read on the system.",1024,90,3.437978982925415
91,CWE-918,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to CWE-918. The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `outerTrees` function does not properly validate the `points` parameter, which can be controlled by the user. An attacker can potentially provide a malicious value for the `points` parameter, which can lead to a blind server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.

The `outerTrees` function uses the `cross` function to compute the 2D cross product of two vectors, which is used to determine the orientation of the points. However, the `cross` function does not properly validate the `points` parameter, which can lead to a vulnerability if an attacker can control the `points` parameter.

For example, an attacker can potentially provide a malicious value for the `points` parameter, which can cause the `outerTrees` function to make a request to an unexpected host or port, potentially bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly.

Therefore, it is important to properly validate the `points` parameter to prevent such vulnerabilities.",1019,249,9.673646211624146
92,CWE-22,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to CWE-22. The function `outerTrees` takes a list of points as input and returns a list of points that form the outermost convex hull of the input points. The function uses the `cross` function to compute the 2D cross product of two vectors, which is used to determine the orientation of the points in the convex hull. However, the `cross` function does not properly validate the input points, which allows an attacker to manipulate the output of the function by providing malicious input points. Specifically, an attacker can provide a point that is very close to the original point, but in the opposite direction, which can cause the function to return an incorrect result. This vulnerability can be exploited to bypass security measures that rely on the correctness of the convex hull computation.",1072,179,6.876639366149902

94,CWE-918,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The function `outerTrees` is not using any user-controlled input, and it is not using any external libraries that could be vulnerable to this type of attack. Additionally, the function is not using any external resources, and it is not making any requests to external servers. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",1059,91,3.596383571624756
95,CWE-79,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The reason is that the `mark_safe()` function is used to render the custom field values, which allows an attacker to inject malicious script into the page. This can be exploited by a malicious user to execute arbitrary code on the victim's browser.

To fix this vulnerability, the `mark_safe()` function should be replaced with the appropriate use of `format_html()` instead. This will ensure that the custom field values are properly escaped and cannot be used to inject malicious script into the page.",2656,132,5.654084205627441
96,CWE-918,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the code retrieves the contents of a URL provided by the user, without verifying that the URL is valid or that it is being sent to the expected destination. This allows an attacker to send a request to a URL that is not intended to be accessed by the server, potentially bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attacker from accessing the URL directly.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
db_element = db_session.query(db_object).filter(db_filter == add_element).first()
```
The `db_filter` variable is set to `db_object.lang_code` if `db_type` is `'languages'`, `db_object.value` if `db_type` is `'custom'`, and `db_object.name` otherwise. The `add_element` variable is a user-provided value that is used to filter the results of the query.

An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by providing a URL that is not intended to be accessed by the server, but is instead a URL that can be accessed by the attacker. For example, the attacker could provide a URL that is on a different host or",1668,301,12.34985637664795
