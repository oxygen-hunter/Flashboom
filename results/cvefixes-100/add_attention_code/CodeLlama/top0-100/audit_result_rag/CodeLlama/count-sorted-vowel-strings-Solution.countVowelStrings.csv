In this case, the pathname is constructed by joining the `settings.backup.folder` directory with the `filename` variable, which is a user-controlled input.

The `send_file` function is used to send the file to the client. The `max_age` parameter is set to 0, which means that the file will be sent with the `Cache-Control` header set to `no-cache`. The `as_attachment` parameter is set to `True`, which means that the file will be sent as an attachment.

The code does not use any special elements in the `filename` variable to escape outside of the restricted directory. The `filename` variable is a user-controlled input, but it is not used in any way that would allow an attacker to access files or directories outside of the restricted directory.

95,CWE-79,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `mark_safe()` method in the `rendered_value` variable. This method is used to mark a string as safe for use in a web page, but it does not actually sanitize the string. Instead, it simply marks the string as safe, which allows it to be rendered without being escaped.

However, in this case, the string is not actually safe. It contains user-supplied data, which could potentially be malicious. If an attacker is able to inject malicious data into the `custom_column_expected` dictionary, it could be rendered as HTML and executed by the web browser. This could allow the attacker to perform a variety of malicious activities, such as stealing cookies or sending malicious requests to other web sites.

To fix this vulnerability, the `mark_safe()` method should be replaced with a safer method, such as `format_html()`. This method will sanitize the string and prevent it from being executed as HTML.",2341,243,9.43839406967163
