The code is using the `any` and `not_` methods to filter the results based on the `format` field of the `Data` model. It is not possible to exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious URL or port number as an input.

However, the code is using the `filter` method to filter the results based on the `format` field of the `Data` model. This can be a potential vulnerability if the `format` field is not properly validated. For example, if the `format` field is not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code that could be executed on the server.

8,CWE-918,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-918.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code blindly trusts the input from the user, without validating it. The `include_extension_inputs` and `exclude_extension_inputs` are user-provided inputs, and the code does not check if they are valid file extensions or not. This means that an attacker can potentially provide malicious inputs, such as ""exe"" or ""bat"", which could lead to a server-side request forgery attack.

The `isSolvable` function in the second code snippet also appears to be vulnerable to CWE-918. The function takes a list of words and a result as input, and it uses a backtracking algorithm to determine if the result can be formed by concatenating the words. However, the function does not validate the input, and it does not check if the words are valid or not. This means that an attacker can potentially provide malicious inputs, such as ""exe"" or ""bat"", which could lead to a server-side request forgery attack.

In both cases, the vulnerability is caused by the lack of input validation, which allows an attacker to provide malicious inputs that can be used to bypass security controls or perform unauthorized actions on the server.",1036,292,10.086134433746338
9,CWE-918,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-918.

The vulnerability is due to the fact that the code does not properly validate the input values before using them in a query. The `include_series_inputs` and `exclude_series_inputs` variables are not properly sanitized, which allows an attacker to inject malicious data and potentially execute a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack.

The `adv_search_serie` function takes in a list of `include_series_inputs` and `exclude_series_inputs` as input, and then uses these inputs to filter the query. However, the code does not properly validate the input values before using them in the query. This means that an attacker can potentially inject malicious data, such as a URL or a hostname, into the query, which can be used to execute an SSRF attack.

For example, an attacker could inject a URL that points to a malicious server, which can then be used to retrieve sensitive data from the server. This can be done by using the `include_series_inputs` and `exclude_series_inputs` variables to filter the query, and then using the resulting data to execute the SSRF attack.

The function uses a lookup table to keep track of the values of each character in the words, and it uses a set to keep track of the values that have already been used.

If the `carry` variable is not properly initialized, it can cause the function to access memory outside of the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

The `send_file` function is used to send a file to the client, and it takes a pathname as an argument. The pathname is used to identify the file that is to be sent. The `send_file` function does not allow the user to control the pathname, and it does not allow the user to access files or directories outside of the restricted directory.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-22.",1048,192,6.684982538223267

The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct a file path, and then passing that path to the `send_file` function. The `send_file` function is a Flask function that is used to send a file to the client. It does not allow the user to specify the protocol or the hostname, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

Additionally, the code is not using the `requests` library to make the HTTP request, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",1043,160,5.596296072006226

The code is using the `mark_safe()` method to render the custom field values, which is the correct way to do it. The `mark_safe()` method is used to mark a string as safe for use in a template, which means that it will be rendered as-is without any escaping. This is the correct way to render custom field values, as they may contain HTML or other special characters that need to be treated as-is.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-79.",2640,130,4.808719158172607

The code is using the `filter` method to filter the results based on the `db_filter` variable, which is set to the `lang_code` attribute of the `db_object` if the `db_type` is 'languages', or the `value` attribute if the `db_type` is 'custom'. The `filter` method is used to retrieve the first element that matches the filter, and the code checks if the element is `None` before adding it to the `db_book_object`.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918, as it is not using the `filter` method to retrieve the contents of a URL or similar request, but rather to filter the results based on the attributes of the `db_object`.",1652,188,6.644760847091675

100,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code is using the `os.path.join()` function to combine the `author_dir` and `title_dir` variables, which are both user-supplied strings. However, the code is not properly sanitizing the input strings, and it is not checking for any potential directory traversal attacks.

The `os.path.join()` function is designed to handle directory separators, and it will automatically add a separator character between the two input strings if necessary. However, the code is not using this function correctly, as it is not properly handling the case where the input strings contain directory separators.

For example, if the `title_dir` variable contains a string like ""../"", the `os.path.join()` function will automatically add a separator character between the two input strings, resulting in a path like ""author_dir/../title_dir"". This could potentially allow an attacker to access files outside of the expected directory, depending on the value of the `author_dir` variable.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly sanitize the input strings and ensure that they do not contain any directory separators. Additionally, the code should use the `os.path.join()` function correctly, by passing in the two input strings separately and not concatenating them manually.",2060,296,10.394971132278442
