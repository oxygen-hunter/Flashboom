The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `watchedVideosByFriends` function does not correctly perform authorization checks on the `watchedVideos` list. The function takes in a list of friends and a list of watched videos, and returns a list of videos that the friends have watched. However, the function does not check whether the user has access to the videos or not. This allows an attacker to access videos that they should not be able to access, which can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposure, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.

To fix this vulnerability, the function should perform authorization checks on the `watchedVideos` list to ensure that the user has access to the videos before returning them. This can be done by checking whether the user has access to the videos or not, and returning an empty list if the user does not have access to any of the videos.",755,217,7.792713403701782

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `is_safe_url` function does not check if the URL's scheme is HTTP or HTTPS, which allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the URL even if it is not a valid URL. For example, an attacker could inject a URL with the `javascript:` scheme, which would execute the code on the victim's browser.

To fix this vulnerability, the `is_safe_url` function should be updated to properly sanitize the URL and check if the scheme is HTTP or HTTPS.

82,CWE-78,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to OS command injection. The `exec` function is used to execute arbitrary Python code, which can be controlled by an attacker. This can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands, which can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `exec` function does not properly sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary operating system commands. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute commands that are not intended to be executed, such as deleting files or modifying system settings.

To fix this vulnerability, the `exec` function should be used with caution and proper input validation should be implemented to ensure that only trusted input is executed. Additionally, the use of `exec` should be avoided whenever possible, and alternative methods should be used to execute Python code, such as using a sandboxed environment or a virtual machine.",1044,219,7.877072334289551
83,CWE-22,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to CWE-22. The `load` function uses the `exec` function to execute code from an external source, which can potentially execute arbitrary code. This can lead to a vulnerability if the external source contains malicious code that can be executed with the privileges of the current process.

In the case of the `watchedVideosByFriends` function, the `exec` function is used to execute code from the `bs-extensions` file, which is retrieved using the `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile` function. This function does not perform any validation or sanitization of the input, which means that the `exec` function can execute any code that is present in the `bs-extensions` file.

If an attacker is able to control the contents of the `bs-extensions` file, they can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current process. This can lead to a variety of vulnerabilities, including code execution, data exfiltration, and other types of attacks.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to validate and sanitize the input to the `exec` function to ensure that only trusted code is executed.

The `watchedVideosByFriends` function is also not using any user input.

The code checks if the `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` form fields are present in the request, and if not, it returns an error message. It does not allow the user to specify arbitrary URLs or ports for the conversion.

The vulnerability CWE-918 is related to the use of external resources, such as URLs, and the lack of proper validation and sanitization of user input. The code does not use external resources, and it does not allow the user to specify arbitrary URLs or ports for the conversion. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",1244,154,5.876683473587036
100,CWE-918,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The code is using the `os.path.join` function to combine the `author_dir` and `title_dir` variables, which are both user-supplied values. However, the code is not using the `os.path.join` function to validate the input values, and it is not checking for any potential directory traversal attacks. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",1786,108,4.039427757263184
