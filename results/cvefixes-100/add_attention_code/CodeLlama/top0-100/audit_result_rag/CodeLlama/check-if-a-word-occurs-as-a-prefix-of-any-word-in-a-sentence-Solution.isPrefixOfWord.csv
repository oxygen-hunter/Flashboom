The prefix table is computed based on the pattern and it is not possible to create a pattern that would cause the algorithm to enter an infinite loop.

Additionally, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-835 because it is not possible to create a pattern that would cause the algorithm to enter an infinite loop. The KMP algorithm is designed to handle overlapping patterns and it is not possible to create a pattern that would cause an infinite loop.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-835.",1059,236,8.169281482696533
87,CWE-444,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-444.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `smuggle_url` function, which allows an attacker to add arbitrary HTTP headers to a request made by the `yt-dlp` tool. This can allow the attacker to manipulate the request in a way that is not intended by the tool, potentially leading to cookie exfiltration.

The `smuggle_url` function is used to add a `Referer` header to the request, which is used to identify the source of the request. However, the function does not properly validate the input, allowing an attacker to add a malicious `Referer` header that can be used to manipulate the request.

This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2023-46121, which affects the `yt-dlp` tool and allows an attacker to MITM the request made by the tool. The vulnerability is caused by the usage of outdated or incompatible HTTP protocol versions in the HTTP agents.",1856,236,8.285522699356079
88,CWE-79,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-79.

The code is using the `urlencode` function to encode the error message, which is then used in the `redirect_to_login` function. The `redirect_to_login` function is used to redirect the user to the login page with the error message as a query parameter. The `is_authenticated` function is used to check if the user is authenticated or not.

The code is not vulnerable to CWE-79 because the error message is not being used in a way that could allow an attacker to inject malicious code. The error message is being encoded using the `urlencode` function, which escapes any special characters in the message, including the `<` and `>` characters that could be used to inject malicious code.

Additionally, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-79 because the error message is not being used in a way that could allow an attacker to inject malicious code. The error message is being used to display an error message to the user, and the user is not being redirected to a different page that could be controlled by an attacker.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-79.",2123,273,9.561537742614746
89,CWE-22,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22.

The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct a path to a file or directory, and then passing that path to the `send_file` function. The `send_file` function is responsible for sending the file or directory to the client, and it does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22.

The `os.path.join` function is designed to handle paths with special elements such as "".."" and ""/"" separators, and it does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22. The `send_file` function is also designed to handle paths with special elements, and it does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-22.

The function `backup_download` does not use the `filename` parameter in a way that allows an attacker to access a file outside of the restricted directory. The `send_file` function is used to send the file to the client, and the `os.path.join` function is used to construct the path to the file. The `max_age` and `as_attachment` parameters are used to set the cache control headers and to force the browser to download the file, respectively. The `filename` parameter is used to set the name of the file that is sent to the client, but it is not used to construct the path to the file.
