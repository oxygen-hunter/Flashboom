81,CWE-264,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264.

The vulnerability is due to the fact that the code does not properly implement token expiration. This means that a user can bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining, leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account, or leveraging possession of a token for an account with a changed password.

For example, a user can create a new token by providing a valid token and a new password for the same user account. The new token will have the same user ID and tenant ID as the original token, but with a new token ID. This new token will be considered valid by the system, even though the user's password has been changed.

Another example is that a user can create a new token by providing a valid token and a tenant ID for a different tenant. The new token will have the same user ID as the original token, but with a new tenant ID. This new token will be considered valid by the system, even though the user does not have access to the new tenant.

The code does not properly implement token expiration by not checking the expiration time of the token when creating a new token. This means that a user can create a new token with a valid token and a new password or tenant ID, even if the original token has expired.

However, the code is using the `cmp` function to compare two integers, which is not a secure way to compare integers. It is recommended to use the `==` operator instead of `cmp` to compare integers.",1033,123,4.366188287734985
87,CWE-444,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-444.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `smuggle_url` function, which allows an attacker to add arbitrary HTTP headers to the request made by the `yt-dlp` tool. This can allow the attacker to manipulate the request in a way that the tool does not expect, potentially leading to cookie exfiltration.

The `smuggle_url` function is used to add a `Referer` header to the request, which is used to identify the source of the request. However, the function does not properly validate the input, allowing an attacker to add a malicious `Referer` header that can be used to manipulate the request.

This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2023-46121, which affects the `yt-dlp` tool and allows an attacker to MITM the request made by the tool. The vulnerability is caused by the use of an outdated or incompatible HTTP protocol version in the HTTP agents.

To fix this vulnerability, the `smuggle_url` function should properly validate the input and prevent malicious `Referer` headers from being added to the request. Additionally, the tool should be updated to use a more recent and secure HTTP protocol version.",1830,293,10.262972354888916

However, it does not validate the filename or ensure that it is a valid file. This means that an attacker could potentially provide a malicious filename that could be used to access sensitive files on the server or to perform other types of attacks.

The `countMatchingSubarrays` function is also vulnerable to CWE-918. The `getPrefix` function takes a user-controlled pattern as input and returns a prefix array that is used to search for the pattern in a text. However, the `getPrefix` function does not validate the pattern or ensure that it is a valid pattern. This means that an attacker could potentially provide a malicious pattern that could be used to access sensitive data on the server or to perform other types of attacks.

In both cases, the vulnerability is due to the fact that the code does not properly validate user-controlled input and does not ensure that the input is valid. This allows attackers to potentially exploit the vulnerability by providing malicious input that could be used to access sensitive data or perform other types of attacks.",884,269,9.318812131881714
