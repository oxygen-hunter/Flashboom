The code is using the `force_text` and `force_str` functions to escape the `reason` parameter before using it in the error message. This makes the code safe against reflected XSS attacks.

The `redirect_to_login` function is also used to redirect the user to the login page, which makes the code safe against stored XSS attacks.

The `is_authenticated` function is used to check if the user is authenticated, which makes the code safe against DOM-based XSS attacks.

The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, and the `send_file` function to send the file to the client. The `send_file` function is properly sanitizing the filename variable and using it in the pathname, which prevents the vulnerability.",779,101,3.725917100906372

91,CWE-918,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The function `backup_download` is not vulnerable to CWE-918 because it does not involve any user-controlled input or output. The function takes a filename as an argument and returns a file object, which is not affected by the vulnerability.

The function `minimumSwap` is also not vulnerable to CWE-918 because it does not involve any user-controlled input or output. The function takes two strings as arguments and returns the minimum number of swaps required to make the strings equal. The function does not involve any external requests or file access, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",766,158,5.92618203163147
92,CWE-22,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22. The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory. The `os.path.join` function is properly neutralizing special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

In the `swaggerui_static` function, the `filename` parameter is used to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath the `static` directory. The `os.path.join` function is properly used to construct the pathname, and the resulting pathname is not vulnerable to CWE-22.

In the `minimumSwap` function, the `s1` and `s2` parameters are used to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath the `libs` directory. The `os.path.join` function is properly used to construct the pathname, and the resulting pathname is not vulnerable to CWE-22.

The code is using the `mark_safe()` method to render the custom field values, which is the correct way to render user-authored content in Django. The `mark_safe()` method is used to indicate that the content is safe to be rendered in the browser without any additional escaping or encoding.

96,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code is using the `filter` method to retrieve a specific element from a database based on a filter condition. The filter condition is based on the `db_filter` variable, which is set to the `lang_code` attribute of the `db_object` if the `db_type` is 'languages', or the `value` attribute if the `db_type` is 'custom'.

The code then checks if the retrieved element is `None`, and if it is not, it creates a new element with the same name and adds it to the `db_book_object`. If the element is `None`, it creates a new element with the same name and adds it to the `db_book_object`.

There is no evidence in the code that the `db_filter` variable is being manipulated or tampered with, which would allow an attacker to bypass the filter condition and retrieve a different element from the database.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",1415,241,8.819707155227661
