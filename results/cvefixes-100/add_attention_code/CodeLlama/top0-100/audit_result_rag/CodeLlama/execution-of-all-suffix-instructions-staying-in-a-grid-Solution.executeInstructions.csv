1,CWE-918,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The function `get_response` is not vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) because it only allows requests to URLs that are explicitly allowed by the `is_private_address` function. Additionally, the function does not allow requests to URLs that are not in the same domain as the Redash server.

However, the function does have a potential vulnerability in the `executeInstructions` function. The function uses a defaultdict to store the results of the previous instructions, which can lead to a potential denial of service attack if the number of instructions is very large. The function does not have any input validation or sanitization, which can allow an attacker to inject malicious instructions that can cause a denial of service.

7,CWE-918,"  YES, the second code is vulnerable to CWE-918.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `include_extension_inputs` and `exclude_extension_inputs` variables in the `adv_search_extension` function. These variables are not properly sanitized, which allows an attacker to inject malicious data and potentially execute arbitrary code.

For example, an attacker could inject a malicious value in the `include_extension_inputs` variable, which could be a format string that is then used to execute arbitrary code. Similarly, an attacker could inject a malicious value in the `exclude_extension_inputs` variable, which could be a format string that is then used to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is similar to the SQL injection vulnerability, where an attacker can inject malicious data into a SQL query and execute arbitrary code. The difference is that the vulnerability is in the Python code, rather than in the SQL query.

To fix the vulnerability, the `adv_search_extension` function should properly sanitize the `include_extension_inputs` and `exclude_extension_inputs` variables by using a secure input validation mechanism, such as a whitelist or a blacklist. Additionally, the function should use a secure output encoding mechanism, such as a secure HTML encoding, to prevent the injection",973,301,10.831708431243896

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `filter` method in the `adv_search_serie` function. The `filter` method takes a function as an argument, which is applied to each element in the iterable. In this case, the function is `db.Books.series.any(db.Series.id == serie)`. The vulnerability is that the function is not properly sanitized, which allows an attacker to inject malicious code.

For example, an attacker could pass a value for `serie` that is a malicious SQL query, such as `'; DROP TABLE Books; --`. This would result in the `filter` method applying the malicious query to the `Books` table, which could result in the loss of data or other security issues.

To fix this vulnerability, the `adv_search_serie` function should properly sanitize the input values for `serie` using a library such as `sqlalchemy.sql.expression.BindParameter`.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `include_shelf_inputs` and `exclude_shelf_inputs` parameters in the `adv_search_shelf` function. These parameters are used to filter the results of the query based on the shelf of the books. However, the code does not properly validate the values of these parameters, which allows an attacker to inject malicious values and potentially bypass security controls.

For example, an attacker could send a request with `include_shelf_inputs` set to `['*']` and `exclude_shelf_inputs` set to `['*']`, which would result in the query returning all books in the database, regardless of their shelf. This could potentially allow an attacker to access sensitive information or perform other malicious actions.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly validate the values of the `include_shelf_inputs` and `exclude_shelf_inputs` parameters to ensure that they are valid and do not contain malicious values.

91,CWE-918,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The code is using the `send_file` function from Flask to send a file to the client, and it is not vulnerable to the described vulnerability. The `send_file` function is designed to handle file names and paths safely, and it does not allow arbitrary file access. The vulnerability is related to the `requests` library, which is not used in the given code.",940,100,3.6776909828186035
92,CWE-22,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22.

The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct a path to a file or directory, and then passing that path to the `send_file` function. The `send_file` function is responsible for sending the file or directory to the client, and it does not allow the user to control the path that is being sent.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-22, as the user is not able to control the path that is being sent.",993,125,4.622254848480225
93,CWE-22,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22.

The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct a path to a file or directory, and then passing that path to the `send_file` function. The `send_file` function is responsible for sending the file or directory to the client, and it is not vulnerable to CWE-22.

The `os.path.join` function is designed to handle paths with special characters, such as "".."" and ""/"", and it will properly escape these characters when constructing the path. The `send_file` function is also designed to handle paths with special characters, and it will properly escape these characters when sending the file or directory to the client.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-22.",985,182,6.554531574249268
94,CWE-918,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct a file path, and it is not using any user-controlled input to construct the path. The `os.path.join` function is a safe way to construct file paths, and it does not allow for any vulnerabilities related to CWE-918.",980,90,3.583512306213379
95,CWE-79,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `mark_safe()` method in the `LocationTable` class, which allows untrusted data to be rendered as HTML. This can lead to the execution of malicious scripts in the context of the web browser, potentially allowing an attacker to steal sensitive information or perform other malicious actions.

The specific vulnerability is caused by the `custom_column_expected` dictionary, which contains user-supplied data that is not properly sanitized before being rendered as HTML. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious payload that is executed when rendering pages containing this content.

To fix this vulnerability, the `LocationTable` class should use appropriate sanitization techniques, such as using the `format_html()` method instead of `mark_safe()`, to ensure that the data is properly escaped before being rendered as HTML. Additionally, appropriate object permissions should be applied to restrict which users are permitted to create or edit the aforementioned types of user-authored content.",2577,240,9.144659042358398
96,CWE-918,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The vulnerability is related to the use of user-supplied data in the `add_objects` function, but the code does not appear to be using user-supplied data in the `executeInstructions` function.",1589,65,3.062422275543213

98,CWE-918,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The function `executeInstructions` does not have any direct interaction with the request or response objects, and it does not perform any operations that could potentially allow an attacker to bypass access controls or perform unauthorized actions. The function is only responsible for executing a series of instructions based on the input parameters, and it does not have any side effects or dependencies on external resources. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",1455,112,4.790632009506226

100,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code is using the `os.path.join()` function to combine the `author_dir` and `title_dir` variables, which are both user-supplied strings. However, the code is not using the `os.path.join()` function in a way that could allow an attacker to manipulate the path to a file on the server.

The `os.path.join()` function is used to combine two or more path components into a single path, using the appropriate separator character for the platform. The function does not allow an attacker to manipulate the path to a file on the server, as it only combines the path components and does not allow an attacker to specify a different path.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",1997,188,6.89736533164978
