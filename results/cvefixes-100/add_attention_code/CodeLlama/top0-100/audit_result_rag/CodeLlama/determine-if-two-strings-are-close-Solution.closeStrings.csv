1,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code checks if the URL is a private address and if so, it raises an exception. It also checks if the authentication values are given and if not, it gets the authentication values from the `self.get_auth()` method.

The code then calls the `requests_session.request()` method with the given HTTP method, URL, and authentication values. It also checks if the response status code is not 200 and if so, it sets the `error` variable to a string.

The code then catches any `requests.HTTPError` or `requests.RequestException` exceptions and sets the `error` variable to a string.

Finally, the code returns the response and error.

Therefore, the code does not allow the user to make requests to private addresses or to bypass access controls. It also does not allow the user to make requests to unexpected hosts or ports.
