The function `swaggerui_static` is not responsible for handling user-controlled input, and it does not pass any user-controlled input to `send_file`. The function `singleDivisorTriplet` is responsible for handling user-controlled input, but it does not use `send_file` or any other function that could be vulnerable to CWE-918.",779,103,3.7488338947296143
95,CWE-79,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-79.

The code is using the `mark_safe()` method to render the custom field values, which is the correct way to do it. The `mark_safe()` method is used to mark a string as safe for use in an HTML context, which means that it will not be escaped and will be rendered as is.

The code is also using the `get_cell()` method to retrieve the rendered value of the custom field, which is also the correct way to do it. The `get_cell()` method returns the rendered value of the cell, which is the result of the `render_column()` method, which is responsible for rendering the custom field value.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-79, as it is using the correct methods to render the custom field values and retrieve the rendered value of the custom field.",2376,197,8.061178922653198
96,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code is using the `db_session.query()` method to retrieve objects from the database, and it is filtering the results based on the `db_filter` variable, which is set to the `lang_code`, `value`, or `name` attribute of the `db_object` depending on the value of the `db_type` variable.

The code is not using any user-supplied input in the `db_filter` variable, and it is not using any user-supplied input in the `add_element` variable in the `for` loop. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

However, the code is using the `helper.get_sorted_author()` method, which could potentially be vulnerable to CWE-918 if the `helper` object is not properly sanitizing user-supplied input.",1388,209,8.045946836471558

The code checks if the `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` form fields are present in the request, and if not, it returns an error message. It does not allow the user to specify arbitrary URLs or ports for the conversion.

The `convert_book_format` function is called with the `book_id`, `config.config_calibre_dir`, `book_format_from.upper()`, `book_format_to.upper()`, and `current_user.name` as arguments. It does not allow the user to specify arbitrary URLs or ports for the conversion.

The `singleDivisorTriplet` function is not related to the vulnerability. It is a function that calculates the number of triplets of integers that have a single common divisor. It does not allow the user to specify arbitrary URLs or ports for the conversion.

The code is using the `os.path.join()` function to construct a file path, and then normalizing the path using `replace('\\', '/')`. This is a safe way to construct a file path, as it ensures that the path is properly escaped and does not contain any malicious characters.

The code is also using the `helper.get_valid_filename()` function to ensure that the file name is properly escaped and does not contain any malicious characters. This function is likely to be a custom function that is not part of the standard Python library, so it is not possible to determine whether it is vulnerable to CWE-918 without more information.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",1796,182,6.8646299839019775
