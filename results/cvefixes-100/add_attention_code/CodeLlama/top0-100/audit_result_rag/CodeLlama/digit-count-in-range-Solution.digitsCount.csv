The vulnerability is caused by the `digitsCount` function, which takes a number `n` and a digit `d` as input, and returns the number of digits in `n` that are greater than or equal to `d`. The function uses a pivot variable to optimize the calculation, but it does not properly validate the input values.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious request to the server, with a high value of `n` and a low value of `d`, and the server will calculate the number of digits in `n` that are greater than or equal to `d`, which is the number of digits in `n` that are greater than or equal to `d`.

For example, if `n` is 1000000000 and `d` is 1, the server will return 10, which is the number of digits in `n` that are greater than or equal to 1.

An attacker can use this vulnerability to make the server send a request to an unexpected host or port, which can bypass access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly. The server can be used as a proxy to conduct port scanning of hosts in internal networks, use other",1958,301,11.296279907226562

The `digitsCount` function takes three arguments: `d`, `low`, and `high`. The function calculates the number of digits in the range `[low, high]` that are equal to `d`. The function is vulnerable to an off-by-one error, which can cause the function to return an incorrect result.

The error occurs when the `low` argument is equal to `0`, and the `d` argument is equal to `1`. In this case, the function will return `0` instead of `1`, because the `min` function will return `0` when the first argument is less than the second argument.

92,CWE-22,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22. The `swaggerui_static` function is not using user-controlled input to construct a pathname, and it is not using the `send_file` function to read a file from disk. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-22.",772,74,2.9747111797332764
93,CWE-22,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-22 because it does not use user-controlled input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located outside of a restricted parent directory. The code uses the `os.path.join` function to construct the pathname, which takes two or more arguments and concatenates them using the appropriate separator for the operating system. The `os.path.join` function does not allow the user to specify a pathname that is outside of the restricted directory.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-22.",764,132,4.9664788246154785
94,CWE-918,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The function `digitsCount` is not used to generate a URL or similar request, and it does not pass any user-controlled variables to `requests.get()` without any sanitization. Therefore, it does not contain the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-50266.",759,84,3.0749568939208984
95,CWE-79,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-79.

The code is using the `mark_safe()` method to render the custom field values, which is the correct way to render user-authored content in Django. The `mark_safe()` method is used to indicate that the content is safe to be rendered in the browser without any additional escaping or encoding.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-79, as it is properly using the `mark_safe()` method to render the custom field values.",2356,120,4.744372606277466
96,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code is using the `filter` method to filter the results of a query based on a specific condition. The condition is that the `db_filter` variable should be equal to the `add_element` variable. The `add_element` variable is a user-supplied value, but it is not being used as a parameter for the `filter` method. Instead, it is being used as a value to create a new object.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918, as it is not using the `add_element` variable as a parameter for the `filter` method.",1368,153,6.034559726715088

The code checks if the `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` form fields are present in the request, and if not, it returns an error message. It does not allow the user to specify arbitrary URLs or ports for the conversion.

The code does not use the `os.path.join()` function to construct the path to the book file, but instead constructs the path manually by combining the `author_dir` and `title_dir` variables. This means that the code does not have any vulnerabilities related to the `os.path.join()` function.
