The vulnerability is in the `maxNiceDivisors` function, which calculates the maximum value of the product of the prime factors of a number. The function has a bug in the calculation of the maximum value, which allows an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions.

For example, the number 12 has prime factors 2, 2, and 3, but the function only considers the prime factors that are either 3 or 2, and therefore does not correctly calculate the maximum value of the product of the prime factors.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions, for example, by using a number with a large number of prime factors that are not 3 or 2, and therefore the function would not correctly calculate the maximum value of the product of the prime factors.

The code is using the `filter` method to retrieve a specific element from a database based on a filter condition. The filter condition is based on the `db_filter` variable, which is set to either `db_object.lang_code`, `db_object.value`, or `db_object.name`, depending on the value of the `db_type` variable.

The `filter` method is a safe operation in this context, as it is being used to retrieve a specific element from a database based on a filter condition. The `filter` method does not allow the user to specify any additional parameters or conditions that could potentially lead to a vulnerability.

Therefore, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",1467,180,6.743554592132568
98,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code checks if the `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` form fields are present in the request, and if not, it returns an error message. It does not allow the user to specify arbitrary URLs or ports to access.

The `maxNiceDivisors` function is not related to the vulnerability, as it is a separate function that is not called in the given code.",1333,109,4.231196403503418
