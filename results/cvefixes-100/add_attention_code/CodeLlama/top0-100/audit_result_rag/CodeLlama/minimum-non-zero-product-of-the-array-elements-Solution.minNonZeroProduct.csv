Additionally, it is important to properly validate and sanitize any user input, including the contents of the file that is being executed.",869,190,7.0745062828063965
84,CWE-352,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-352.

The code is using the `json` parameter of the `client.post()` method to send a JSON payload to the server. The `json` parameter is used to specify the JSON data that will be sent in the request body. The code is also using the `data` parameter of the `client.post()` method to send a URL-encoded payload to the server.

The vulnerability CWE-352 is related to the use of cookies in the request body, and the code is not using cookies in the request body. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-352.

However, the code is using the `json` parameter to send a JSON payload to the server, which could potentially be vulnerable to other types of attacks, such as JSON injection or JSON parsing errors. Therefore, it is recommended to use a secure JSON library to handle JSON payloads in the request body.",1526,212,8.353662967681885
85,CWE-290,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a CWE-290 issue.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `validate_agent_data` function does not properly sanitize the input data before using it. Specifically, the `agent_data['allowlist']` is not properly sanitized, which allows an attacker to inject malicious data and potentially lead to a log spoofing attack.

The `config.valid_exclude_list` function is also vulnerable to the same issue, as it does not properly sanitize the input data before using it. This can lead to a log spoofing attack, where an attacker can manipulate the log messages to make them appear as if they are coming from a trusted source.

The `minNonZeroProduct` function is not vulnerable to this issue, as it properly sanitizes the input data before using it. However, it is still vulnerable to other types of attacks, such as a replay attack, where an attacker can replay a previous message to manipulate the log messages.

In summary, the code is vulnerable to a CWE-290 issue, which can lead to a log spoofing attack. It is important to properly sanitize all input data before using it to prevent such attacks.",900,282,10.689257860183716

87,CWE-444,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to CWE-444.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `smuggle_url` function, which allows an attacker to add arbitrary HTTP headers to a request made by the `yt-dlp` tool. This can allow the attacker to manipulate the request in a way that is not intended by the tool, potentially leading to cookie exfiltration.

The `smuggle_url` function is used to add a `Referer` header to the request, which is used to bypass the same-origin policy and make the request appear to come from a different domain. However, this header can be manipulated by an attacker to make the request appear to come from a different domain, potentially allowing the attacker to access cookies that are not intended to be accessed by the tool.

The `smuggle_url` function is used in the code to add a `Referer` header to the request made by the `yt-dlp` tool to access the Vimeo video. This header is used to bypass the same-origin policy and make the request appear to come from a different domain. However, this header can be manipulated by an attacker to make the request appear to come from a different domain, potentially allowing the attacker to access cookies that are not intended to be accessed by the tool.

88,CWE-79,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-79.

The code is using the `urlencode` function to encode the error message, which is then used in the `redirect_to_login` function. The `redirect_to_login` function is used to redirect the user to the login page with the error message as a query parameter. The `is_authenticated` function is used to check if the user is authenticated, and if so, it raises a `Problem` with a helpful link.

The code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-79 because the error message is properly encoded and used in a secure way. The `redirect_to_login` function is also used in a secure way, as it is used to redirect the user to the login page with a query parameter that contains the error message.

The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct a path to a file or directory, and the `send_file` function to send the file to the client. The `os.path.join` function is not vulnerable to path traversal attacks, as it only allows for the construction of a path that is within the same directory as the script. Additionally, the `send_file` function is not vulnerable to path traversal attacks, as it only allows for the sending of files that are within the same directory as the script.

93,CWE-22,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22. The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory. The `os.path.join` function is properly sanitizing the input filename by using the `os.path.dirname` function to get the parent directory of the current file, and then using the `os.path.dirname` function again to get the parent directory of the parent directory. This ensures that the resulting pathname is not outside of the restricted directory.

However, the `send_file` function is not properly sanitizing the input filename, and it is using the `os.path.join` function to construct the pathname. This means that the input filename can still be used to access files or directories outside of the restricted directory.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to CWE-22, and it is recommended to use a safer method to construct the pathname, such as using the `os.path.normpath` function to normalize the pathname and remove any special elements that could cause the pathname to resolve to a location outside of the restricted directory.",952,268,10.584390878677368

The function `minNonZeroProduct` is also not vulnerable to CWE-918 because it does not receive any user-controlled input and it does not use any user-controlled input to construct the URL.,947,112,4.1164021492004395
95,CWE-79,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The reason is that the `mark_safe()` API is not used correctly when rendering certain types of user-authored content, such as custom links, job buttons, and computed fields. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script that is executed by the web browser, potentially leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, the maintainers of Nautobot have fixed the incorrect uses of `mark_safe()` by replacing them with appropriate use of `format_html()` instead. This ensures that the data is properly sanitized and cannot be used to execute malicious script.

It is important to note that this vulnerability only affects users of Nautobot versions earlier than 1.6.6 or 2.0.5, and upgrading to these versions should resolve the issue. Additionally, appropriate object permissions should be applied to restrict which users are permitted to create or edit the aforementioned types of user-authored content.",2544,233,9.63978624343872
96,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code is using the `filter` method to retrieve a specific element from the database based on a filter condition. The filter condition is based on the `db_filter` variable, which is set to the `lang_code` attribute of the `db_object` if the `db_type` is 'languages', or the `value` attribute if the `db_type` is 'custom'.

The code then checks if the retrieved element is `None`, and if it is not, it creates a new element with the same name and adds it to the `db_book_object`.

There is no evidence in the code that the `db_filter` variable is not properly sanitized, and there is no indication that the code is vulnerable to a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack.
