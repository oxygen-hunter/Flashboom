The vulnerability is in the `format_date` function, which uses `strptime` to parse the date string. However, the `format_date` function does not properly validate the input date string, which can lead to a potential vulnerability.

The `strptime` function can be used to parse a wide range of date formats, but it is not foolproof.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `next_permutation` function does not properly handle the `\\r\\n` sequence, which can be used to inject a carriage return and line feed character (CRLF) into the `num` string. This can lead to a CRLF attack, which can cause the `getMinSwaps` function to return an incorrect result.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted `num` string that contains the `\\r\\n` sequence, followed by a `Set-Cookie` header that sets a cookie with a malicious value. For example, the attacker could send a `num` string that looks like this:
```
233\r\nSet-Cookie: name=salt
```
This will cause the `getMinSwaps` function to return an incorrect result, as it will interpret the `\\r\\n` sequence as a CRLF character and will not properly handle the `Set-Cookie` header.

71,CWE-93,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a CWE-93 vulnerability.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `str` function to convert the `value` parameter to a string. This can lead to a potential security issue if the `value` parameter is a user-supplied string that contains a carriage return character (ASCII code 13) followed by a line feed character (ASCII code 10).

When the `str` function is used to convert a string that contains a carriage return character followed by a line feed character, it will convert the carriage return character to a line feed character. This can lead to a situation where the string is modified in a way that is not intended by the developer.

For example, if the `value` parameter is set to the string ""233\r\nSet-Cookie: name=salt"", the `str` function will convert the carriage return character to a line feed character, resulting in the string ""233\nSet-Cookie: name=salt"". This can lead to a situation where the string is modified in a way that is not intended by the developer, which can potentially lead to a security vulnerability.

Therefore, it is recommended to use the `unicode` function to convert the `value` parameter to a string, as this will prevent the carriage return character from being converted to a line feed",865,301,11.337939739227295

To fix this vulnerability, the `test_security_check` function should check if the escaped URLs are still valid URLs before allowing them to pass the security check.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `smuggle_url` function, which allows an attacker to add arbitrary HTTP headers to a request made by the `yt-dlp` tool. This can allow the attacker to MITM the request and exfiltrate cookies or other sensitive information.
