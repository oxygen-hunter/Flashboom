The `join` method is not vulnerable to CWE-116 because it is not possible for an attacker to inject malicious code into the `plugin_names` list, as the list is created by the developer and is not user-supplied. Additionally, the `join` method is not vulnerable to SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, as it is not used to construct a SQL query or an HTML document.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-116.",1451,224,8.358041286468506
79,CWE-918,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The function `_check_login_status` is not responsible for handling user-supplied URLs, and it does not use the `X-Direct-Url` header to determine the URL to be proxied. The `merge` function is responsible for handling the merging of two sorted arrays, and it does not involve any user-supplied URLs.",960,91,3.4632203578948975
80,CWE-601,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to the CWE-601 vulnerability. The code is using the `get_object_or_404` method to retrieve the `Topic` object, which will raise a `Http404` exception if the object does not exist. The code is also using the `is_post` method to check if the request is a POST request, which will also raise a `Http404` exception if the request is not a POST request.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to the CWE-601 vulnerability, as it is not possible to redirect the user to a malicious site by modifying the URL value.",1017,151,5.4701244831085205
81,CWE-264,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264.

The vulnerability is due to the fact that the code does not properly implement token expiration. This means that an attacker can bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining, leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account, or leveraging possession of a token for an account with a changed password.

The code does not properly check the expiration time of the token, which allows an attacker to create a new token that is valid for a longer period than the original token. This can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the system.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly implement token expiration by checking the expiration time of the token and rejecting it if it has expired. This can be done by adding a check for the token's expiration time before using it to authenticate the user.",3349,201,8.301681280136108
82,CWE-78,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to OS command injection. The `exec` function is used to execute the code in the `code` variable, which is a string that is retrieved from a file. The `exec` function does not allow the execution of arbitrary commands, and the code is not being executed with any special privileges. Additionally, the `merge` function is not being used to execute any commands, it is only being used to merge two lists.",1016,96,3.621910572052002
83,CWE-22,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-22. The `merge` function does not use any external input to construct a pathname, and it does not attempt to access files or directories outside of the restricted directory. Therefore, it does not contain any vulnerabilities related to path traversal.",663,65,2.4509782791137695
84,CWE-352,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a CWE-352 vulnerability. The code is using the `json.loads` function to parse the request body, but it is not checking the content-type header to ensure that the request is a JSON request. This means that if the request is not a JSON request, the `json.loads` function will still try to parse the request body, which could lead to a security vulnerability if the request body contains malicious data.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the content-type header to ensure that the request is a JSON request before parsing the request body. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the content-type header is set to ""application/json"" or another JSON compatible media type before calling the `json.loads` function.",1320,175,6.702320098876953
85,CWE-290,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-290.

The code is using the `json.loads()` function to parse the `allowlist` JSON string, which is a valid JSON object. The `valid_exclude_list()` function is then called to validate the `exclude` list, which is a list of regular expressions. The `json.loads()` function is used to parse the `allowlist` JSON string, which is a valid JSON object, and the `valid_exclude_list()` function is used to validate the `exclude` list, which is a list of regular expressions.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-290, as it is properly validating the `allowlist` JSON object and the `exclude` list of regular expressions.",694,178,6.5547380447387695
86,CWE-835,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-835. The code is not an infinite loop, but rather a while loop that exits when the condition `i >= 0 and j >= 0` is no longer true. The loop is also protected by a try-except block, which catches any exceptions raised during the loop and logs them. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-835.",890,95,3.5574541091918945
87,CWE-444,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-444.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `smuggle_url` function, which allows an attacker to set an arbitrary proxy for a request to an arbitrary URL, allowing the attacker to MITM the request made from yt-dlp's HTTP session. This could lead to cookie exfiltration in some cases.

The code is vulnerable because it does not interpret malformed HTTP requests or responses in ways that are consistent with how the messages will be processed by those entities that are at the ultimate destination. This allows an attacker to ""smuggle"" a message to the client/server without the intermediary being aware of it.",1687,161,5.995993137359619
88,CWE-79,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-79.

The code is using the `force_text` and `force_str` functions to escape the `reason` parameter before using it in the error message. This makes the code safe against reflected XSS attacks.

The `merge` function is not related to the vulnerability, as it is not used in the code snippet provided.",1954,89,3.455453395843506
89,CWE-22,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22. The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct the path to the file, which ensures that the file is located within the restricted directory. The `send_file` function is also used to send the file to the client, which ensures that the file is sent to the client and not to a different location on the server.

However, the code is vulnerable to CWE-22 in the `merge` function. The `merge` function is using the `last` variable to keep track of the last element in the `A` array, and it is not properly validating the input values. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious value for the `m` or `n` parameter, which could cause the `merge` function to access an element outside of the `A` array.

Therefore, the `merge` function is vulnerable to CWE-22, but the `backup_download` function is not.",714,229,8.247415542602539

The code is using the `mark_safe()` method to render the custom field values, which is the correct way to render user-authored content in Django. The `mark_safe()` method is used to indicate that the content is safe to be rendered in the browser without any additional escaping or encoding.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-79, as it is properly using the `mark_safe()` method to render the custom field values.",2338,120,4.586727142333984
96,CWE-918,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the code retrieves the contents of a URL provided by the user, without properly validating the URL or ensuring that it is being sent to the expected destination. This allows an attacker to make it appear as if the server is sending the request, possibly bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly.

The vulnerability can be exploited by providing URLs to unexpected hosts or ports, which can be used to conduct port scanning of hosts in internal networks, use other URLs such as that can access documents on the system (using file://), or use other protocols such as gopher:// or tftp://, which may provide greater control over the contents of requests.

To fix the vulnerability, the code should properly validate the URL and ensure that it is being sent to the expected destination. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed hosts and ports, or by using a library that provides a secure way to retrieve the contents of a URL.",1350,246,9.532800912857056

The code is using the `os.path.join()` function to combine the `author_dir` and `title_dir` variables, which are both user-supplied values. However, the `os.path.join()` function is used in a way that ensures the resulting path is normalized and does not contain any invalid characters.

The `os.path.join()` function takes two or more path components as arguments and returns a normalized path. The resulting path is made by joining the base path with the relative path, and any relative components are normalized and removed.

In this case, the `author_dir` and `title_dir` variables are both user-supplied values, but they are not used as relative paths. Instead, they are used as base paths for the `path` variable. The `path` variable is then created by combining the `author_dir` and `title_dir` variables using the `os.path.join()` function, which ensures that the resulting path is normalized and does not contain any invalid characters.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918, as it is not using the `os.path.join()` function in a way that could allow an attacker to bypass access controls or access unauthorized resources.",1758,301,11.015941619873047
