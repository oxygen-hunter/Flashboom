2,CWE-918,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The code is using the `urlparse` library to parse the URL and extract the hostname, and then using the `socket.gethostbyname` function to resolve the hostname to an IP address. The code is then using the `ipaddress` library to check if the IP address is a private IP address.

The vulnerability CWE-918 is related to the use of `socket.gethostbyname` to resolve hostnames to IP addresses. The vulnerability occurs when an attacker can control the hostname that is being resolved, and the attacker can use this to bypass access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attacker from accessing the IP address directly.

However, the given code is not using `socket.gethostbyname` to resolve hostnames to IP addresses. Instead, it is using the `urlparse` library to parse the URL and extract the hostname, and then using the `ipaddress` library to check if the IP address is a private IP address.

For example, if the `value` parameter is a string that contains a carriage return character (ASCII code 13), it may be interpreted as a newline character by the `str` function, which can lead to a security issue if the `value` parameter is used in a context where it is not intended to be interpreted as a newline character.

However, this function does not properly sanitize the URL, which allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the URL and potentially execute it.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `is_safe_url` function does not properly check the scheme of the URL. It only checks if the URL is a valid URL and does not check if the scheme is HTTP or HTTPS. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the URL by using a different scheme, such as `javascript:` or `data:`.

For example, an attacker could inject a malicious URL into the `nasty_url` variable in the code, such as `javascript:alert(1)`. The `is_safe_url` function would not detect this as a malicious URL, and the code would redirect the user to the malicious URL.

To fix this vulnerability, the `is_safe_url` function should be updated to properly check the scheme of the URL and only allow HTTP or HTTPS schemes. This can be done by adding a check for the scheme of the URL and only",2980,301,11.620078325271606

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted `auth` dictionary that contains a malicious `username` and `password`. For example, the attacker could send a `username` that is not a valid user name, but is a valid dictionary key. The function would then extract the malicious `password` from the `auth` dictionary and use it for authentication, which would allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.

The vulnerability is related to the use of the `request.form.get()` method to retrieve form data, but the code does not use this method to retrieve the `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` variables. Instead, it uses the `request.form` dictionary to retrieve the data, which is not vulnerable to the described attack.",1741,95,3.610827922821045
100,CWE-918,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The vulnerability is related to the use of `os.path.join` to combine the path and normalize it from Windows systems, but the code does not use `os.path.join` to combine the path and normalize it from Windows systems. Instead, it uses `helper.get_valid_filename` to get a valid filename from the title and author, which is a different function that does not have the same vulnerability.",2283,109,4.27057147026062
