The function uses a nested loop to iterate over the elements of the grid and calculates the sum of the elements in each row and column.

93,CWE-22,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22.

The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory. The `os.path.join` function is used to concatenate two or more pathnames together, and it is designed to handle special elements such as "".."" and ""/"" separators.

The code is not using the `os.path.join` function to construct the pathname, but rather it is using the `send_file` function to send the file to the client. The `send_file` function is used to send a file to the client, and it is designed to handle special elements such as "".."" and ""/"" separators.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-22.",1080,194,7.301292419433594
94,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct a file path, and then passing that path to the `send_file` function. The `send_file` function is a Flask function that is used to send a file to the client. It does not allow the user to specify the protocol or the hostname, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

Additionally, the code is not using the `requests` library to make HTTP requests, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",1075,159,6.233471155166626
95,CWE-79,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-79.

The code is using the `mark_safe()` method to render the custom field values, which is the correct way to do it. The `mark_safe()` method is used to mark a string as safe for use in an HTML context, which means that it will be rendered as-is without any escaping or encoding.

The code is also using the `get_cell()` method to retrieve the value of the custom field, which is the correct way to do it. The `get_cell()` method returns the value of the cell as a string, which is then rendered using the `mark_safe()` method.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-79.",2672,166,6.552124261856079
96,CWE-918,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The vulnerability is related to the use of user-supplied data in the `add_objects` function, but the code does not appear to be using user-supplied data in the `getBiggestThree` function.",1684,65,2.6334710121154785
97,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code is using the `filter` method to filter the results of a query based on a specific condition. The condition is that the `db_filter` variable should be equal to the `add_element` variable. The `add_element` variable is a user-supplied value, but it is not being used in a way that could allow an attacker to manipulate the query.

The only way that an attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability is if they were able to inject malicious SQL code into the `add_element` variable. However, the code is not doing this, and it is not vulnerable to SQL injection.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",1684,175,6.562326431274414
98,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code checks if the `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` fields are present in the request form, and if not, it returns an error message. It does not allow the user to specify arbitrary URLs or ports for the conversion.

The vulnerability CWE-918 is related to the use of external resources, such as URLs, in a web application. It is not related to the code provided.",1550,113,4.425058841705322
99,CWE-918,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The vulnerability is related to the use of user-supplied data in the `convert_book_format` function, but the code does not appear to be using user-supplied data in the `getBiggestThree` function.",1550,67,2.6162946224212646
100,CWE-918,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The code is using the `os.path.join` function to combine the `author_dir` and `title_dir` variables, which are both user-supplied values. However, the code is not using the `os.path.join` function to combine the `author_dir` and `title_dir` variables with any other values, so it is not vulnerable to the CWE-918 vulnerability.",2092,110,4.4635703563690186
