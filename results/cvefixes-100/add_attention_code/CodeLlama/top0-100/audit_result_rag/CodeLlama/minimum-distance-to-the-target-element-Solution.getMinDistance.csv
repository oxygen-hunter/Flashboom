The `&` operator is used to perform a bitwise AND operation on the `role` field and the `constants.ROLE_ADMIN` constant, which will result in a value of 1 if the user has the admin role, and 0 if the user does not have the admin role.

The code then checks if the result of the bitwise AND operation is equal to the `constants.ROLE_ADMIN` constant, which means that the user has the admin role. If the user does not have the admin role, the code will raise an exception.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918 because it is using the `op('&')` operator to perform a bitwise AND",1835,301,11.242733240127563

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `exec` function is being used to execute Python code that is not properly sanitized. The `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile` function is not properly sanitizing the input, which means that an attacker can inject arbitrary commands to be executed on the system.

The vulnerability CWE-352 is related to the use of cookies in the request body. The code is not using cookies in the request body, so it is not vulnerable to this vulnerability.

However, the code is using the `json.loads()` method to parse the JSON data in the request body. If the `json.loads()` method fails to parse the JSON data, it will raise a `ValueError` exception. The code is catching this exception and returning a 400 status code with a custom error message.
