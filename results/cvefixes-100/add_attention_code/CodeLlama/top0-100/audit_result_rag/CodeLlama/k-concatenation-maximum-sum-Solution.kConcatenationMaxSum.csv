However, the `is_safe_url` function does not properly sanitize the URL, which allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the URL and potentially execute it.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `is_safe_url` function does not check if the URL's scheme is HTTP or HTTPS, which allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the URL even if it is not HTTP or HTTPS.

The `smuggle_url` function is used to add a custom HTTP header to the request, but it is not vulnerable to the CWE-444 vulnerability because it is not interpreting malformed HTTP requests or responses in ways that are consistent with how the messages will be processed by the client or server.

88,CWE-79,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-79.

The code is using the `force_text` and `force_str` functions to escape the `reason` parameter before using it in the error message. This is a good practice to prevent XSS attacks.

However, the code is not using the `escape` function to escape the `reason` parameter in the `login_url` variable. If the `reason` parameter contains user input, it could lead to an XSS attack.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to CWE-79.",2004,129,4.886056423187256
89,CWE-22,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22. The function `backup_download` does not use the `filename` variable in a way that allows an attacker to access a file outside of the restricted directory. The `send_file` function is used to send the file to the client, and the `os.path.join` function is used to construct the path to the file. The `os.path.join` function does not allow an attacker to access a file outside of the restricted directory.

The second function `kConcatenationMaxSum` is vulnerable to CWE-22. The function takes an array of integers and a positive integer `k` as input, and returns the maximum sum of `k` consecutive elements in the array. The function uses the `max` function to find the maximum sum, and the `sum` function to calculate the sum of the elements in the array. The `max` function and the `sum` function do not allow an attacker to access a file outside of the restricted directory.

However, the function does not use the `filename` variable in a way that allows an attacker to access a file outside of the restricted directory. The function only uses the `filename` variable to construct the path to the file, and the `os.path.join` function does not allow an attacker to access a file outside of the restricted",764,301,10.81027889251709
90,CWE-22,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22. The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, and the `send_file` function to send the file to the client. The `send_file` function is properly sanitizing the filename and preventing the path traversal vulnerability.

However, the `kConcatenationMaxSum` function is vulnerable to CWE-22 because it is using the `max` function to calculate the maximum sum of a list of integers, and the `sum` function to calculate the sum of the list. The `max` function is not properly sanitizing the input, and the `sum` function is not properly handling the case where the input list is empty. This could lead to a potential vulnerability if the input list is not properly validated.",756,205,7.676089286804199
91,CWE-918,  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The function `backup_download` is not vulnerable to CWE-918 because it does not receive user-controlled input and it does not use the `requests` library to make HTTP requests.

The `add_element` variable is a user-supplied value, but it is not being used as a filter in the query. Instead, it is being used as a value to create a new object.

The code is using the `request.form.get()` method to retrieve the values of the `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` form fields, which are then used to call the `helper.convert_book_format()` method. The `helper.convert_book_format()` method is not vulnerable to the CWE-918 vulnerability because it is not using the `urllib` library to retrieve the contents of the URL, and it is not using the `requests` library to send the request to the upstream component.

However, the code is vulnerable to a different type of vulnerability, which is a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The `book_id` parameter is being used in a SQL query without proper sanitization, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code and potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands. To fix this vulnerability, the `book_id` parameter should be properly sanitized using a library such as `sqlalchemy.orm.Session.query.params()` or `sqlalchemy.orm.Session.query.bindparam()`.",1266,260,9.701528072357178

The `os.path.join()` function is used to create a valid path from two or more strings, and it does not allow the user to specify the protocol or the hostname. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to the type of attack described in the CWE-918 description.
