The vulnerability is due to the use of the `any` and `not_` functions in the `adv_search_extension` function. These functions are used to filter the results based on the format of the data, but they do not properly validate the input. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious format string that is not properly sanitized, allowing them to bypass the intended filter and retrieve data that they are not authorized to access.

For example, an attacker could provide a format string that includes a malicious SQL injection, allowing them to execute arbitrary SQL commands and retrieve sensitive data from the database. Alternatively, an attacker could provide a format string that includes a malicious file inclusion, allowing them to read and execute arbitrary code on the server.

To fix this vulnerability, the `adv_search_extension` function should properly validate the input format string to ensure that it is a valid format string that is not malicious. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed format strings, or by using a library that provides proper input validation, such as the `format` function in the `string` module.",940,264,10.491192817687988

To fix this vulnerability, the `__setitem__` method should properly sanitize the `key` before using it as a dictionary key.

The code then checks if the result of the bitwise AND operation is equal to the `constants.ROLE_ADMIN` constant, which means that the user has the admin role. If the user does not have the admin role, the code will raise an exception.

In this case, the code that is passed to `exec` is the result of the `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile` function, which is a user-supplied value. This means that an attacker can pass a malicious string to this function, which will be executed by the `exec` function. This can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, which can lead to a variety of security vulnerabilities.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly sanitize and validate the input that is passed to the `exec` function.
