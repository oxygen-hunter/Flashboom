1,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code is using the `requests` library to make HTTP requests, which automatically handles the redirection and the handling of the response. The code is not using the `requests` library directly, but rather it is using the `requests_session` object, which is a session object that is created by the `requests` library.

The `requests_session` object is used to make HTTP requests, and it automatically handles the redirection and the handling of the response. The code is not using the `requests_session` object directly, but rather it is using the `request` method of the `requests_session` object to make HTTP requests.

The `request` method of the `requests_session` object takes the URL as an argument, and it automatically handles the redirection and the handling of the response. The code is not using the `request` method directly, but rather it is using the `requests_session.request` method to make HTTP requests.

The code is not accepting user-controlled input and is not using it to redirect the request to a malicious site. Instead, it is using the input to calculate the cost of a path in a grid. The input is used to determine the starting and ending positions of the path, and the code is calculating the cost of the path based on the values of the cells in the grid.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-601, which is a vulnerability that occurs when a web application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site, and uses that link in a Redirect. This could cause the web application to redirect the request to the specified URL, potentially leading to a phishing attack.",2581,179,7.765209674835205

5,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The code is using the `join` method to concatenate the list of trusted hosts with the `Content-Security-Policy` header, which is a valid way to set the header value. The code is also using the `strip` method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the list of trusted hosts, which is also a valid way to handle the input.

However, the code is not using the `split` method to split the list of trusted hosts into individual hosts, which could potentially lead to a vulnerability if the list of trusted hosts contains a malicious host. For example, if the list of trusted hosts contains a host with a malicious script that is executed when the user visits the website, the script could potentially be executed on the user's browser, which could lead to a vulnerability.

Therefore, it is recommended to use the `split` method to split the list of trusted hosts into individual hosts, and then use the `join` method to concatenate the list of trusted hosts with the `Content-Security-Policy` header. This would ensure that the list of trusted hosts is properly sanitized and would help prevent any potential vulnerabilities.",1105,271,11.389164686203003
6,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The code is using the `join` method to concatenate the `host` values in the `config_trustedhosts` list, and the resulting string is then used as the value for the `Content-Security-Policy` header. This does not allow an attacker to bypass the CSP and load malicious content.

However, the code is vulnerable to a different type of attack, which is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by sending a request to the server with a malicious URL that points to a host or port that is not intended to be accessed by the server. The server would then retrieve the contents of this URL, potentially allowing the attacker to access sensitive information or perform other malicious actions.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the `host` values in the `config_trustedhosts` list are properly validated and sanitized before being used in the `Content-Security-Policy` header. Additionally, the code should ensure that the `Content-Security-Policy` header is properly set and that it is not possible for an attacker to bypass it.",1105,270,10.538503646850586

The code is using the `mark_safe()` method to render the custom field values, which is the correct way to do it. The `mark_safe()` method is used to mark a string as safe for use in a template, which means that it will not be escaped and will be rendered as is.

The code is also using the `get_cell()` method to retrieve the value of the custom field, which is the correct way to do it. The `get_cell()` method returns the value of the cell as a string, which is then rendered using the `mark_safe()` method.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-79.",2373,163,7.614940404891968
96,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code is using the `filter` method to filter the results of a query based on a specific condition. The condition is based on the `db_filter` variable, which is set to the `lang_code` attribute of the `db_object` if the `db_type` is 'languages', or the `value` attribute if the `db_type` is 'custom'.

The code then iterates over the `add_elements` list and checks if an element with the same name exists in the database. If it does not exist, a new element is created and added to the database.

There is no evidence in the code that the `filter` method is being used in a way that could allow an attacker to bypass access controls or make it appear that the server is sending the request to an unexpected host or port.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",1385,218,9.002835512161255

The code is using the `request.form.get()` method to retrieve the values of the `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` form fields. The `get()` method returns `None` if the field is not present in the form, and the code is checking for `None` values before proceeding with the conversion.

The code is using the `os.path.join()` function to combine the `author_dir` and `title_dir` variables, which are both user-supplied values. However, the code is not using the `os.path.join()` function in a way that could allow an attacker to bypass access controls.

The `os.path.join()` function is used to create a valid path from two or more path components. It does not allow the user to specify the host or port to which the request is being sent. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.
