The vulnerability is related to the use of the `requests` library to make HTTP requests, and the code does not use the `requests` library directly. Instead, it uses the `requests_session` object, which is a custom object that is not vulnerable to the same vulnerabilities.

2,CWE-918,"  NO. This code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The code is using the `urlparse` library to parse the URL and extract the hostname, and then using the `socket.gethostbyname` function to resolve the hostname to an IP address. The `ipaddress.ip_address` function is then used to convert the IP address to an IPv4 or IPv6 address object, and the `is_private` method is called on the address object to check if the IP address is a private IP address.

The `is_private` method is a method of the `ipaddress.ip_address` class, and it checks if the IP address is a private IP address by checking if the address falls within one of the private IP address ranges defined in RFC 1918. The method returns a boolean value indicating whether the IP address is a private IP address or not.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918 because it is using the `ipaddress.ip_address` class and its `is_private` method to check if the IP address is a private IP address, and it is not using any user input to construct the URL or the IP address.",1738,267,10.089940071105957

The `in_` operator is a part of the SQLAlchemy library and is used to filter the results of a query based on a list of values. It is not possible to inject SQL code using this operator.

However, the code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks through the `sort_param` parameter. The `sort_param` parameter is used to sort the results of the query based on a specific column.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. Parameterized queries are a way to pass values to a query as parameters, rather than including them directly in the query string. This can help prevent SQL injection attacks by making it more difficult for attackers to inject malicious code.

98,CWE-918,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The vulnerability is related to the use of user-supplied data in the `request.form.get()` method, which is not used in the provided code. The code is using the `request.form.get()` method to retrieve the values of the `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` fields, but it is not using the values in any way that could allow an attacker to manipulate the server. The code is simply using the values to perform a conversion between two formats.",1973,124,4.6280951499938965

100,CWE-918,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The code is using the `os.path.join` function to combine the `author_dir` and `title_dir` variables, which are both user-supplied values. However, the code is not using the `os.path.join` function in a way that could allow an attacker to manipulate the path to a file on the server.

The `os.path.join` function is used to combine two or more path components into a single path, using the appropriate separator character for the platform. The function does not allow an attacker to manipulate the path to a file on the server, as it only combines the user-supplied values and does not allow any manipulation of the resulting path.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",2515,188,7.268658399581909
