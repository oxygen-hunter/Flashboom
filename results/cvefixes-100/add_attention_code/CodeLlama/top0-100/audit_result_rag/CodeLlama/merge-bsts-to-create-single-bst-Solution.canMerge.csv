69,CWE-93,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a CWE-93 vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `str(value)` function is used to convert the `value` to a string, which can result in a CRLF (carriage return line feed) sequence being added to the string. This can lead to a CRLF attack, where an attacker can inject a malicious sequence of characters that can cause the server to redirect the user to a malicious website.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer method to convert the `value` to a string, such as the `str.format()` method or the `json.dumps()` method. These methods can help prevent the injection of malicious characters and ensure that the string is properly escaped.",1063,174,6.252902507781982
70,CWE-93,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a CWE-93 vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `replace` method is used to replace the underscore character with a hyphen, but it does not check for the presence of a carriage return character (CR) before replacing it. This means that if a CR character is present in the input string, it will be replaced with a hyphen, which can lead to a security vulnerability.

For example, if the input string is ""233\r\nSet-Cookie: name=salt"", the `replace` method will replace the CR character with a hyphen, resulting in ""233-Set-Cookie: name=salt"". This can cause the cookie to be set with the name ""salt"" instead of the intended value, which can lead to a security vulnerability.

Therefore, it is recommended to use a more secure method of replacing the underscore character with a hyphen, such as the `replace` method with a regular expression that only replaces the underscore character if it is not followed by a CR character.",1021,243,8.900859117507935
71,CWE-93,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a CWE-93 vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `append` method does not properly sanitize the input values before using them. Specifically, the `append` method does not check if the input value is a valid Unicode character, and it does not properly handle the case where the input value is a string that contains a carriage return (CR) character followed by a line feed (LF) character.

In the `append` method, the input value is first converted to a string using the `str` function. However, if the input value is a string that contains a CR character followed by a LF character, the `str` function will convert the CR character to a newline character, which can lead to a vulnerability.

For example, if the input value is ""233\r\nSet-Cookie: name=salt"", the `append` method will convert the CR character to a newline character, which will result in the string ""233\nSet-Cookie: name=salt"". This can lead to a vulnerability if the string is used in a context where it is expected to be a valid Unicode character, such as in a regular expression.

Therefore, it is recommended to properly sanitize the input values before using them in the `append` method, to avoid any potential vulnerabilities",1067,301,10.80508542060852
72,CWE-93,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a CWE-93 vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `filter` function does not properly sanitize the input `names` list, which can contain malicious input such as a ""\\r\\n"" sequence. This sequence can be used to inject a CRLF attack, which can lead to a security vulnerability.

The `canMerge` function, on the other hand, appears to be a safe function, as it properly sanitizes the input `trees` list and does not allow any malicious input to be injected.

Therefore, the overall vulnerability of the code is dependent on the `filter` function, which is the vulnerable one.",1063,163,5.975428819656372
73,CWE-93,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a CWE-93 vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `replace` method does not properly sanitize the input values before using them in the `dict` object. Specifically, the `replace` method does not check if the input value is a valid key in the `dict` object, and it does not properly sanitize the input value before using it as a key. This can lead to a situation where an attacker can inject malicious code into the `dict` object by providing a specially crafted input value.

For example, an attacker can provide a specially crafted input value that contains a carriage return character (ASCII code 13) followed by a line feed character (ASCII code 10). This can lead to a situation where the input value is interpreted as a newline character, which can cause the `replace` method to insert the malicious code into the `dict` object.

To fix this vulnerability, the `replace` method should properly sanitize the input value before using it as a key in the `dict` object. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed characters, or by using a regular expression to validate the input value. Additionally, the `replace` method should check if the input value is a valid key in the `dict` object before using it as a key",1059,301,10.809131145477295
74,CWE-79,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-79.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `test_security_check` function does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `bad_url` variable. The function constructs a URL using the `nasty_url` variable, which is constructed by concatenating the `login_url` with the `bad_url` variable. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the URL, which can be executed by the web browser.

The `safe_url` variable is constructed in a similar manner, but it is properly sanitized. The `good_url` variable is also properly sanitized.

The vulnerability is not present in the `canMerge` function, as it properly sanitizes the input and does not allow the execution of malicious code.",2975,193,7.9362311363220215

The code is using the `op('&')` operator to perform a bitwise AND operation on the `role` column of the `User` table, which is a column that stores the user's role. The `&` operator is used to perform a bitwise AND operation on the two operands, which in this case are the `role` column and the `constants.ROLE_ADMIN` constant.

The `constants.ROLE_ADMIN` constant is a bitmask that represents the admin role, and it is used to check if the user has the admin role. The `&` operator is used to perform a bitwise AND operation on the `role` column and the `constants.ROLE_ADMIN` constant, which will result in a value of 1 if the user has the admin role, and 0 if the user does not have the admin role.

The code then checks if the result of the bitwise AND operation is equal to the `constants.ROLE_ADMIN` constant, which means that the user has the admin role. If the user does not have the admin role, the code will raise an exception.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-284 because it is using the `op('&')` operator correctly to perform a bitwise",2531,301,11.348181009292603

81,CWE-264,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-264.

The vulnerability is due to the fact that the code does not properly implement token expiration. This means that an attacker can bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining, leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account, or leveraging possession of a token for an account with a changed password.

The code does not properly implement token expiration by not checking the expiration time of the token before creating a new token. This means that an attacker can create a new token that is valid for a longer period than the original token, allowing them to bypass the intended authorization restrictions.

Additionally, the code does not properly implement token revocation. When a token is revoked, the code does not remove the token from the token database, which means that the token can still be used even after it has been revoked. This can allow an attacker to continue using the token even after it has been revoked.

Overall, the code is vulnerable to token theft and token reuse attacks, which can allow an attacker to bypass intended authorization restrictions and gain unauthorized access to resources.",3869,258,10.478188276290894
