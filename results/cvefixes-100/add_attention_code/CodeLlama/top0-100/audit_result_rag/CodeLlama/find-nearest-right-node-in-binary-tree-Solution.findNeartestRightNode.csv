1,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code checks if the URL is a private address and raises an exception if it is, which suggests that it is intended to prevent access to private addresses. However, it does not check if the URL is a valid URL or not, which could lead to a vulnerability.

The `requests` library is used to make the HTTP request, and it does not have any built-in checks for valid URLs. Therefore, it is possible to pass an invalid URL to the `requests` library, which could lead to a vulnerability.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should check if the URL is a valid URL before making the HTTP request. This can be done by using a library such as `urllib.parse` to parse the URL and check if it is a valid URL. If the URL is not a valid URL, the code should raise an exception or return an error message.",1606,208,7.6181817054748535
2,CWE-918,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The code is using the `urlparse` library to parse the URL and extract the hostname, and then using the `socket.gethostbyname` function to resolve the hostname to an IP address. The `ipaddress.ip_address` function is then used to create an `IPv4Address` object from the IP address string, and the `is_private` method is called on the `IPv4Address` object to check if the IP address is a private IP address.

The `is_private` method checks if the IP address is a private IP address by checking if the first byte of the IP address is between 10.0.0.0 and 10.255.255.255, or if the first byte is 172 and the second byte is between 16 and 31, or if the first byte is 192 and the second byte is 168. This is done by using the `ipaddress.ip_address` function to convert the IP address string to an `IPv4Address` object, and then using the `is_private` method on the `IPv4Address` object to check if the IP address is a private IP address.
