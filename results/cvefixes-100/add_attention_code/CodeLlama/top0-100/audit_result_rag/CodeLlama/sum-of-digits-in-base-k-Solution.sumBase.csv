However, the `sumBase` method is vulnerable to SSRF attacks. The method takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, and it uses them to calculate the sum of the base.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a value for `n` that is a URL, and a value for `k` that is a port number. The method will then retrieve the contents of the URL, and return the sum of the base.

The code is using the `send_file` function from Flask to send a file to the client, and it is not using any user-controlled variables in the `send_file` function. The `send_file` function is designed to send files from a specific location on the server to the client, and it does not allow for user-controlled variables to be passed to it. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",616,117,4.21645450592041

The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory. The `os.path.join` function is used to concatenate multiple path components into a single pathname, and it does not allow the user to specify a pathname that is outside of the restricted directory.

93,CWE-22,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22. The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory. The `os.path.join` function is used to concatenate multiple path components into a single pathname, and it is designed to handle special elements such as "".."" and ""/"" separators.

In this case, the `os.path.join` function is used to construct the pathname for the static files served by the `swaggerui_static` function. The pathname is constructed by joining the `libs` directory with the `flask_restx` directory, and then joining the `static` directory with the user-controlled `filename` variable. The `filename` variable is not used in the `send_file` function, so it is not vulnerable to path traversal attacks.

Therefore, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22.",661,226,8.144020557403564

95,CWE-79,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The vulnerability is due to the use of the `mark_safe()` method in the `CustomFieldColumn` class, which allows untrusted data to be injected into the HTML output. This can lead to the execution of malicious scripts in the victim's browser.

The `mark_safe()` method is used to mark a string as safe for use in HTML output, but it does not perform any sanitization or validation of the input. This means that if an attacker can control the input data, they can inject malicious code into the HTML output, which can be executed by the victim's browser.

To fix this vulnerability, the `CustomFieldColumn` class should use the `format_html()` method instead of `mark_safe()` to render the HTML output. This method performs sanitization and validation of the input, and it is safer to use than `mark_safe()`.",2253,215,8.149193048477173
96,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code is using the `filter` method to filter the results of a query based on a specific condition. The condition is based on the `db_filter` variable, which is set to the `lang_code` attribute of the `db_object` if the `db_type` is 'languages', or the `value` attribute if the `db_type` is 'custom'.

The `add_elements` list is then iterated over, and for each element, the `db_session.query(db_object).filter(db_filter == add_element).first()` method is called to check if an element with the same name already exists in the database. If an element is found, it is not added to the database.

The code does not allow the user to specify the host or port of the URL to be retrieved, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",1265,215,8.393114805221558

The `filter` method is used to create a new query object that filters the results of the original query based on the specified condition. The `filter` method does not allow the user to specify a custom condition, so it is not possible to inject malicious code into the query.

98,CWE-918,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `request.form.get()` method to retrieve the values of the `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` form fields. This method does not perform any validation or sanitization of the input, which means that an attacker can potentially provide a malicious URL as the value of these fields.

If an attacker is able to provide a malicious URL as the value of `book_format_from` or `book_format_to`, the server will attempt to retrieve the contents of that URL, which could potentially allow the attacker to access resources on the server or other hosts that the server is not authorized to access.

For example, an attacker could provide a URL that points to a malicious website that contains a malicious script that could be executed on the server. Alternatively, an attacker could provide a URL that points to a file on the server that contains sensitive information, such as a configuration file or a database connection string.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should perform proper validation and sanitization of the input values before using them to retrieve the contents of the URL. This could include checking for malicious characters in the URL, such as the ""://"" sequence, and ensuring that the",1131,301,11.90097427368164

The code is using the `os.path.join()` function to combine the `author_dir` and `title_dir` variables, which are both user-supplied values. However, the `os.path.join()` function is used in a way that ensures the resulting path is normalized and does not contain any invalid characters.

The `os.path.join()` function takes two or more path components and combines them into a single path, using the appropriate separator character for the platform. It also normalizes the path by removing any redundant separators and up-level references, such as "".."" or ""."".

In this case, the `author_dir` and `title_dir` variables are both normalized using the `helper.get_valid_filename()` function, which removes any invalid characters from the input string. The resulting path is then combined using `os.path.join()`, which ensures that the resulting path is normalized and does not contain any invalid characters.
