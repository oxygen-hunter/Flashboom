99,CWE-918,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The vulnerability is related to the use of the `request.form.get()` method to retrieve form data, but the code does not use this method to retrieve the `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` variables. Instead, it uses the `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` variables directly, which are not retrieved from the request. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",1459,116,5.160600662231445
100,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code is using the `os.path.join()` function to combine the `author_dir` and `title_dir` variables, which are both user-supplied values. However, the `os.path.join()` function is used in a way that ensures the resulting path is normalized and does not contain any invalid characters.

The `helper.get_valid_filename()` function is also used to normalize the `title` and `db_author.name` values, which are also user-supplied values. This function is used to ensure that the resulting filename is valid and does not contain any invalid characters.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918, as it is properly sanitizing the user-supplied values and ensuring that the resulting path is valid.",2001,196,7.988492488861084
