The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the function does not properly sanitize the URL before using it in the redirect. An attacker could potentially inject malicious content into the URL, which would be reflected back to the user and executed by their browser. This could lead to a variety of attacks, including XSS, phishing, and drive-by attacks.
