2,CWE-918,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The code is using the `urlparse` function to parse the URL and extract the hostname, and then using the `socket.gethostbyname` function to resolve the hostname to an IP address. The code is then using the `ipaddress.ip_address` function to create an IPAddress object from the IP address string, and finally calling the `is_private` method on the IPAddress object to check if the IP address is a private IP address.

The `is_private` method is a method of the `IPAddress` class that checks if the IP address is a private IP address. It does not allow the user to specify a custom IP address or a custom network. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

85,CWE-290,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a CWE-290 attack-focused weakness. The vulnerability is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.

The code is vulnerable because it does not properly sanitize the input data before using it in a regular expression. An attacker could potentially pass a malicious UUID as the 'allowlist' parameter, which could lead to log spoofing on the verifier and registrar.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted UUID that contains a malicious regular expression, which could be used to bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the system.",785,153,5.5331666469573975
86,CWE-835,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-835. The code is using a while loop with a condition that can be influenced by an attacker, but it is not an infinite loop. The loop will exit when the buffer is empty or when the message is fully received. The code also has a try-except block to handle exceptions raised while parsing the message, which will prevent the loop from entering an infinite loop.",981,92,3.5440242290496826
87,CWE-444,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-444.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `smuggle_url` function, which allows an attacker to add arbitrary HTTP headers to a request made by the `yt-dlp` tool. This can allow the attacker to manipulate the request in a way that is not intended by the tool, potentially leading to cookie exfiltration.

The `smuggle_url` function is used to add a `Referer` header to the request, which is set to `https://storyfire.com/`. This header is used to bypass the same-origin policy and allow the request to be made to a different domain. However, this can be used to manipulate the request in a way that is not intended by the tool, potentially leading to cookie exfiltration.

Therefore, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-444, as it allows an attacker to manipulate the request made by the `yt-dlp` tool in a way that is not intended by the tool, potentially leading to cookie exfiltration.",1778,245,9.67656922340393
88,CWE-79,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-79.

The code is using the `urlencode` function to encode the error message, which is then used in the `redirect_to_login` function. The `redirect_to_login` function is used to redirect the user to the login page with the error message as a query parameter. The `is_authenticated` function is used to check if the user is authenticated or not.

The code is not vulnerable to CWE-79 because the error message is not being used in a way that could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the page. The error message is being encoded using the `urlencode` function, which escapes any special characters in the message, making it safe to use in a URL. Additionally, the `redirect_to_login` function is being used to redirect the user to the login page, which means that the error message is not being used in a way that could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the page.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-79.",2045,242,9.237858772277832
89,CWE-22,"  NO. The given code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to CWE-22. The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory. The `os.path.join` function properly neutralizes special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

However, the code is using the `send_file` function to send the file to the client, which could potentially allow an attacker to access the file even if it is located outside of the restricted directory. This is because the `send_file` function does not validate the user-controlled filename variable and uses it in the `send_file` function, which leads to an arbitrary file read on the system. This is a vulnerability related to CWE-22.

Therefore, the code is vulnerable to CWE-22.",805,214,7.635216474533081
90,CWE-22,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22. The `backup_download` function does not use user-controlled input to construct a pathname, and it does not use the `send_file` function to read files from disk. The `remainingMethods` function, on the other hand, uses user-controlled input to construct a pathname, and it uses the `send_file` function to read files from disk. Therefore, the `remainingMethods` function is vulnerable to CWE-22.",797,118,4.441758871078491
91,CWE-918,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The code is using the `send_file` function from Flask to send a file to the client, and it is not using any user-controlled variables in the `send_file` function. The `send_file` function is designed to send files from the server to the client, and it does not allow for user-controlled variables to be passed to it. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",792,113,4.199675559997559
92,CWE-22,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22. The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory. The `os.path.join` function properly neutralizes special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

In the given code, the `os.path.join` function is used to construct the pathname for the static file that is being served. The pathname is constructed using the `os.path.dirname` function to get the directory name of the current file, and then the `os.path.dirname` function is used again to get the directory name of the parent directory of the current file. This is done to ensure that the pathname is relative to the current file and not absolute.

The `os.path.join` function properly neutralizes the special elements within the pathname, such as the ""../"" sequence, to ensure that the pathname resolves to a location that is outside of the restricted directory. Therefore, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22.",845,262,10.127032995223999
93,CWE-22,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22. The `swaggerui_static` function is not using user-controlled input to construct a pathname, and it is not using the `send_file` function to read a file. The `remainingMethods` function is using a BFS algorithm to find the remaining methods in a graph, and it is not using user-controlled input to construct the graph. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-22.",837,110,4.012748718261719
94,CWE-918,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct a file path, and it is not using any user-controlled input to construct the path. The `os.path.join` function is a safe way to construct file paths, and it does not allow for any vulnerabilities related to CWE-918.",832,90,3.2805304527282715
95,CWE-79,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The reason is that the `mark_safe()` API is used to render certain types of user-authored content, including custom links, job buttons, and computed fields. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script into the rendered content, which will be executed by the web browser.

To fix this vulnerability, the maintainers of Nautobot have fixed the incorrect uses of `mark_safe()` by replacing them with appropriate use of `format_html()` instead. This ensures that the malicious data is not executed by the web browser.

Users on Nautobot 1.6.x LTM should upgrade to v1.6.6 and users on Nautobot 2.0.x should upgrade to v2.0.5. Appropriate object permissions can and should be applied to restrict which users are permitted to create or edit the aforementioned types of user-authored content.",2429,221,8.593312978744507
