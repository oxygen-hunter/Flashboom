1,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code checks if the URL is a private address and raises an exception if it is, which means it does not allow the request to be made. Additionally, it also checks if the authentication values are given and uses the `requests_session.request()` method to make the request.

The `requests_session.request()` method is a generic method that can be used to make any type of HTTP request, including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and others. It takes the HTTP method as an argument and the URL as another argument. It also takes any additional parameters that need to be passed to the request, such as headers, data, and so on.

The code does not use the `requests_session.request()` method to make any request that is not a GET request. It only uses the `requests_session.request()` method to make GET requests. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

Furthermore, the code does not use the `requests_session.request()` method to make any request that is not a GET request. It only uses the `requests_session.request()` method to make GET requests. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `db.Books.id.in_` filter in the `archived_filter` variable. This filter allows the attacker to specify a list of book IDs to retrieve, which can be a list of IDs from other books in the database. If the attacker can control the list of IDs, they can potentially retrieve sensitive information or even execute arbitrary code on the server.

For example, an attacker could send a request with a list of IDs that includes the ID of a book that contains sensitive information, such as a password or a credit card number. The server would then retrieve the book with the specified ID and return it to the attacker, potentially allowing them to access the sensitive information.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the list of IDs being retrieved is only from trusted sources, such as the user's own books or books that are publicly accessible.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `db.Books.id.in_` filter in the `archived_filter` variable. This filter allows the attacker to specify a list of book IDs to retrieve, which can be a list of IDs from other books in the database.

For example, an attacker could send a request with a list of IDs that includes the ID of a book that contains sensitive information, such as a password or a credit card number. The server would then retrieve the book with the specified ID and return it to the attacker, potentially allowing them to access the sensitive information.

For example, an attacker can create a new token by using the existing token as the ""old_token"" in the ""authenticate"" function, and then create a new token with a new ""token_id"" and ""user_id"". The new token will be considered valid, and the attacker can use it to access the resources that the original token has access to.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly validate the token before it is returned to the user. This can be done by checking the token's expiration time, or by checking the token's signature to ensure that it has not been tampered with.",3252,209,7.653841972351074
82,CWE-78,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to OS command injection. The `exec` function is used to execute the code in the `code` variable, which is a string that is retrieved from a file. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the code, which can be executed by the `exec` function.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `exec` function does not properly sanitize the input string, which can contain arbitrary commands. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious input string that contains a command to be executed.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly sanitize the input string before passing it to the `exec` function. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed commands, or by using a secure input validation mechanism.",919,175,6.600512266159058
83,CWE-22,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-22. The `load` function uses the `exec` function to execute code from an external source, which can potentially execute arbitrary code on the system. This can lead to a variety of security vulnerabilities, including path traversal attacks.

In the `findNumber` function, the `commonSetBits` function is used to find the number of common set bits between two integers. However, the function does not properly neutralize special elements in the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory. This can allow an attacker to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system, which can lead to a variety of security vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the `findNumber` function is vulnerable to CWE-22.",566,179,6.798559188842773
84,CWE-352,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-352.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the code does not properly verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request. This can be exploited by an attacker to trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server, which will be treated as an authentic request. This can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.",1223,106,4.6624674797058105
85,CWE-290,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a CWE-290 attack-focused weakness.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of unsanitized user input in the `json.loads()` function, which can lead to a log spoofing attack on the verifier and registrar. An attacker can pass a rogue agent with a malicious UUID, which can be used to manipulate the log messages and gain unauthorized access to the system.

To fix this vulnerability, the `json.loads()` function should be replaced with a sanitized version of the function that properly validates the input before using it. Additionally, the `config.valid_exclude_list()` function should be reviewed to ensure that it properly sanitizes the input and validates the regular expressions before using them.",597,181,6.892284393310547
86,CWE-835,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-835.

The code is using a `while` loop with an exit condition that can be reached, i.e., the loop will exit when the buffer is empty. The loop is also using a `try-except` block to catch any exceptions that may occur during the parsing of the incoming data.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-835, which is a weakness where an attacker can manipulate the loop condition to cause an infinite loop.",793,119,4.607614040374756
87,CWE-444,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-444.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `smuggle_url` function, which allows an attacker to set an arbitrary proxy for a request to an arbitrary URL, allowing the attacker to MITM the request made from yt-dlp's HTTP session. This could lead to cookie exfiltration in some cases.

The code is vulnerable because it does not interpret malformed HTTP requests or responses in ways that are consistent with how the messages will be processed by those entities that are at the ultimate destination. This allows an adversary to ""smuggle"" a message to the client/server without the intermediary being aware of it.",1590,161,6.577119827270508
88,CWE-79,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-79.

The code is using the `force_text` and `force_str` functions to escape the `reason` parameter before using it in the error message. This makes the code safe against reflected XSS attacks.

The `redirect_to_login` function is also used to redirect the user to the login page, which makes the code safe against stored XSS attacks.

The `is_authenticated` function is used to check if the user is authenticated, which makes the code safe against DOM-based XSS attacks.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-79.",1857,149,6.0094828605651855

In the given code, the `os.path.join` function is used to construct the pathname for the static file that is being served. The pathname is constructed using the `os.path.dirname` function to get the directory name of the current file, and then the `os.path.dirname` function is used again to get the directory name of the parent directory. This is done to ensure that the pathname is properly constructed and does not contain any special elements that could be used to perform path traversal attacks.

The `add_element` variable is a user-supplied value, but it is not being used in a way that could allow an attacker to manipulate the query.

The only way that the `add_element` variable could be used to manipulate the query is if it is being used as a parameter in a SQL injection attack.
