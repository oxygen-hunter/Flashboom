10,CWE-918,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `db.Books.series.any(db.Series.id == serie)` filter in the `adv_search_serie` function. This filter allows an attacker to specify a series ID that is not present in the database, which can cause the server to send a request to an unexpected host or port.

For example, an attacker could specify a series ID that is not present in the database, but is instead a URL that the server can access. The server would then send a request to this URL, potentially bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attacker from accessing the URL directly.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `adv_search_serie` function should be modified to ensure that the series ID is present in the database before sending the request. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the series ID is valid before using it in the filter.",982,227,8.478530406951904

The function uses the `nth_element` function to find the nth element of the array, where n is the number of elements in the array divided by the number of partitions (P). The `nth_element` function uses a randomized partitioning algorithm to partition the array into three parts: the first element, the last element, and the nth element.

The problem with the `nth_element` function is that it uses a randomized partitioning algorithm, which means that the partitioning process is not deterministic.
