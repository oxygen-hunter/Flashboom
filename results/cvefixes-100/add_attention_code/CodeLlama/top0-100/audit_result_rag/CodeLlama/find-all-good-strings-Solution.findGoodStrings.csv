The code does not properly implement token expiration by not checking the expiration time of the token before creating a new token. This means that an attacker can create a new token that is valid for a long time, and use it to bypass the intended authorization restrictions.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the expiration time of the token before creating a new token. This can be done by calling the `get_token` method of the `token_api` with the `token_id` of the old token, and checking the `expires` field of the returned token.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `smuggle_url` function, which allows an attacker to add arbitrary HTTP headers to a request made by the `yt-dlp` tool. This can allow the attacker to manipulate the request in a way that is not consistent with how the client or server would interpret the message.

In this case, the attacker can add a `Referer` header with a value of `https://storyfire.com/`, which can cause the `yt-dlp` tool to interpret the request as coming from that domain, even if it is not the actual referrer. This can allow the attacker to exfiltrate cookies or other sensitive information from the client's browser.

The CVE-ID for this vulnerability is CVE-2021-25963, and the CWE-ID is CWE-79.

The extended description of the vulnerability is:

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:

* Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
* The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
* During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
* A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
* Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
* This effectively",2455,301,11.796209573745728
