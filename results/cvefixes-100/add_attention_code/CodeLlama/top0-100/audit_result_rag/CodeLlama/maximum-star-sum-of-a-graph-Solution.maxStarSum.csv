9,CWE-918,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-918.

The vulnerability is due to the use of the `filter` method in the `adv_search_serie` function. The `filter` method takes a predicate function as an argument, which is used to filter the elements of a sequence based on a certain condition. In this case, the predicate function is `db.Books.series.any(db.Series.id == serie)`.

The problem is that the `any` method is not properly sanitizing the input `serie` before using it in the predicate function. An attacker could potentially provide a malicious value for `serie`, which could lead to a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack.

For example, an attacker could provide a value for `serie` that is a URL that points to a different host or port, which could allow the attacker to access resources on the server that they should not have access to. This could potentially allow the attacker to bypass access controls or perform other malicious actions.

To fix this vulnerability, the `adv_search_serie` function should properly sanitize the input `serie` before using it in the predicate function. This could involve using a whitelist of allowed values for `serie`, or using a more robust sanitization method such as input validation.",1106,294,11.142111778259277
10,CWE-918,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `db.Books.series.any(db.Series.id == serie)` filter in the `adv_search_serie` function. This filter allows an attacker to specify a series ID that is not present in the database, which can cause the server to send a request to an unexpected host or port.

For example, an attacker could specify a series ID that is not present in the database, which would cause the server to send a request to an unexpected host or port. This could allow the attacker to access resources that they should not have access to, or to bypass access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attacker from accessing the URLs directly.

To fix this vulnerability, the `adv_search_serie` function should be modified to ensure that the series ID is present in the database before using it in the filter. This can be done by checking if the series ID is present in the database before using it in the filter.",1106,237,8.846219778060913

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `redirect()` function in bottle.py does not properly filter the input string, which can contain a carriage return (CR) character followed by a line feed (LF) character (CRLF). This can lead to a potential attack where an attacker can inject a malicious redirect header, which can cause the server to redirect the user to a malicious website.

In the context of the code you provided, the vulnerability is due to the fact that the `redirect()` function does not properly filter the input string, which can contain a CRLF sequence. This can lead to a potential attack where an attacker can inject a malicious redirect header, which can cause the server to redirect the user to a malicious website.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted request to the server, which contains a CRLF sequence in the redirect header. For example, the attacker can send a request with a redirect header that looks like this:

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `nth_element` function, which is used to find the nth largest element in an array. The function uses a randomized partitioning algorithm to partition the array around the nth element, and then returns the nth element. However, the function does not properly handle the case where the nth element is the pivot element, and the partitioning algorithm does not properly handle the case where the pivot element is the nth element.

In the code, the `nth_element` function is used to find the nth largest element in the `adj` array, which is used to store the adjacency list of a node. If the nth element in the `adj` array is the pivot element, the function will return the pivot element, which is not the nth largest element. This can lead to a vulnerability if the nth element is the pivot element, as it can cause the function to return an incorrect result.

In this specific case, the `replace` method is used to replace the `\\r\\n` sequence with a space character, which can cause the input to be modified in a way that is not intended by the developer. This can lead to a security vulnerability if the input is used in a way that is sensitive to the presence of the `\\r\\n` sequence.

To fix this vulnerability, the developer should use a more secure method of handling the `\\r\\n` sequence, such as using a regular expression to replace the sequence with a space character.

However, this function does not properly sanitize user-supplied data, which can lead to XSS attacks.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `is_safe_url` function does not check if the URL scheme is HTTP or HTTPS, which allows an attacker to inject malicious content into the URL. For example, an attacker could inject a URL with the `javascript:` scheme, which would be treated as safe by the `is_safe_url` function. This would allow the attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, which could be executed by the victim's browser.

To fix this vulnerability, the `is_safe_url` function should be modified to properly sanitize user-supplied data, such as checking if the URL scheme is HTTP or HTTPS.

The vulnerability is related to the use of user-supplied data in the `request.form.get()` method, but the code does not appear to be using user-supplied data in the `convert_bookformat()` function. The `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` variables are being retrieved from the `request.form` object, but they are not being used as user-supplied data.

However, the code is vulnerable to a different type of vulnerability, CWE-918, which is related to the use of user-supplied data in the `helper.convert_book_format()` method. The `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` variables are being passed to this method as user-supplied data, which could potentially lead to a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, the `helper.convert_book_format()` method should be modified to properly validate and sanitize the user-supplied data before using it in the conversion process. Additionally, the `convert_bookformat()` function should be modified to properly validate and sanitize the user-supplied data before using it in the conversion process.",1588,285,10.764765501022339
100,CWE-918,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The vulnerability is related to the use of `os.path.join` to combine the path and normalize it from Windows systems, but the code does not use `os.path.join` to combine the path and normalize it from Windows systems. Instead, it uses `replace` to replace the backslash character with a forward slash character. This is not a vulnerability to CWE-918.",2130,104,4.057897329330444
