The `os.path.join` function properly handles special elements such as "".."" and ""/"" separators, and does not allow the pathname to resolve to a location outside of the restricted directory. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-22.",946,113,4.513054132461548

91,CWE-918,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to the CWE-918 vulnerability. The code is using the `send_file` function from the Flask framework, which is designed to handle file downloads and does not allow arbitrary requests to be sent to external hosts. The `max_age` parameter is used to set the maximum age of the file in seconds, and the `as_attachment` parameter is used to indicate that the file should be downloaded as an attachment rather than displayed in the browser.

The `maxSumRangeQuery` function is not vulnerable to the CWE-918 vulnerability because it is not using the `send_file` function to send a file to the client. Instead, it is using the `itertools.izip` function to zip together the `nums` and `count` lists, and then using the `addmod` and `mulmod` functions to calculate the sum of the products of the elements in the zipped lists. The `MOD` variable is used to set the modulus for the calculations.

Therefore, the `maxSumRangeQuery` function is not vulnerable to the CWE-918 vulnerability.",933,256,9.571081638336182
92,CWE-22,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22. The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct a path to a file, and the `send_file` function to send the file to the client. The `send_file` function is a safe way to send files, as it takes care of the file path and ensures that the file is sent correctly.

94,CWE-918,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The function `swaggerui_static` is not used in the `maxSumRangeQuery` function, and it does not involve any user-controlled input. The `maxSumRangeQuery` function is using the `itertools.izip` function to zip the `nums` and `count` lists together, and then iterating over the zipped list to calculate the sum. The `count` list is not user-controlled, and the `nums` list is sorted before the calculation. Therefore, there is no vulnerability to CWE-918.",973,139,5.127975940704346
95,CWE-79,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-79.

The code is using the `mark_safe()` method to render the custom field values, which is the correct way to do it. The `mark_safe()` method is used to mark a string as safe for use in an HTML context, which means that it will not be escaped or encoded. This is necessary because the custom field values are user-generated content, and it is not possible to know in advance whether they will contain any malicious code.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-79, as it is properly using the `mark_safe()` method to render the custom field values.",2570,149,5.9154393672943115

The code is using the `os.path.join()` function to combine the `author_dir` and `title_dir` variables, which are both user-supplied values. However, the code is not using the `os.path.join()` function in a way that could allow an attacker to manipulate the path to a file on the server.

The `os.path.join()` function is used to combine two or more path components into a single path, using the appropriate separator character for the platform. The function does not allow an attacker to manipulate the path to a file on the server, as it only combines the path components and does not allow an attacker to specify a different path.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",1990,188,6.951923847198486
