The code is using the `smuggle_url` function to add a custom HTTP header to the request, which is a legitimate use case. The `smuggle_url` function is not vulnerable to CWE-444 because it is not interpreting malformed HTTP requests or responses in ways that are consistent with how the messages will be processed by the client or server.

Furthermore, the code is not using the `http_headers` parameter to smuggle a custom HTTP header to the request, which is the vulnerability that CWE-444 is trying to exploit. The `http_headers` parameter is only used to specify the custom HTTP headers that should be added to the request, and it is not used to smuggle a custom HTTP header to the request.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-444.",1608,211,8.40191388130188
88,CWE-79,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-79.

The code is using the `urlencode` function to encode the error message, which is then used in the `redirect_to_login` function to redirect the user to the login page with the error message. The `redirect_to_login` function is a Django function that is used to redirect the user to the login page, and it does not allow any user input to be passed to the login page. Therefore, the error message is not being passed to the login page, and it is not vulnerable to XSS.

Additionally, the code is also using the `force_text` and `force_str` functions to ensure that the error message is properly encoded and that the login URL is properly constructed. These functions are used to ensure that the error message and the login URL are properly encoded and that the login URL is properly constructed. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to XSS.",1875,207,7.880284070968628
89,CWE-22,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22. The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory. The `send_file` function is then used to send the file to the client. The `max_age` parameter is set to 0, which means that the file will be sent with the `Cache-Control` header set to `no-cache`. The `as_attachment` parameter is set to `True`, which means that the file will be sent as an attachment.

However, the code does not use the `os.path.join` function to construct the pathname, and it does not use the `send_file` function to send the file to the client. Instead, it uses the `haveConflict` function to check if two events have a conflict. The `haveConflict` function takes two lists of strings as input, and it returns `True` if the maximum value of the first list is less than or equal to the minimum value of the second list.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-22 because it does not use the `os.path.join` function to construct a pathname, and it does not use the `send_file` function to send a file to the client.",635,300,10.856619834899902

The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory. The `os.path.join` function is used to concatenate two or more pathnames to form a new pathname. In this case, the pathname is constructed by joining the `settings.backup.folder` directory with the `filename` variable, which is a user-controlled input. The `max_age` and `as_attachment` parameters are used to specify the file download options.

The `send_file` function is used to send the file to the client. The `max_age` parameter is used to specify the maximum age of the file in seconds. The `as_attachment` parameter is used to specify whether the file should be sent as an attachment or not.

The code does not use any special elements in the `filename` variable to escape outside of the restricted directory. The `filename` variable is used to construct the pathname, but it is not used to construct the pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located outside of the restricted directory.

The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory. The `os.path.join` function is used to concatenate multiple path components into a single pathname, and it is designed to handle special elements such as "".."" and ""/"" separators.

In this case, the `os.path.join` function is used to construct the pathname for the static file that is being served by the `swaggerui_static` function. The pathname is constructed by joining the `libs` directory with the `flask_restx` directory, and then joining the `static` directory with the `filename` variable. The `filename` variable is a user-controlled input, but it is not used in the `os.path.join` function to construct the pathname.
