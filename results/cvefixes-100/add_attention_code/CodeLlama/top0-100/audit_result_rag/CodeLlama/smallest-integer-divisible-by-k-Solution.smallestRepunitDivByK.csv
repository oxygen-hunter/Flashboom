In this case, the user-supplied input is the `add_element` parameter, which is used to construct the filter condition. However, the code does not properly validate the `add_element` parameter, and it is not clear how the input is being used in the filter condition.

Therefore, it is not clear whether the code is vulnerable to CWE-918 or not. It is important to review the code carefully and ensure that any user-supplied input is properly validated and sanitized to prevent potential vulnerabilities.",1619,245,9.482055902481079
97,CWE-918,"  NO, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code is using the `filter` method to retrieve a specific element from the database based on a filter condition. The filter condition is based on the `db_filter` variable, which is set to the `lang_code` attribute of the `db_object` if the `db_type` is 'languages', or the `value` attribute if the `db_type` is 'custom'.

The code then checks if the retrieved element is `None`, and if it is not, it creates a new element with the same name and adds it to the `db_book_object`.

The vulnerability CWE-918 is related to the use of unvalidated user input in a filter condition, which can lead to a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack. However, the code does not appear to be vulnerable to this type of attack because the filter condition is based on a validated user input (the `db_type` variable).

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",1619,246,10.098768472671509
98,CWE-918,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to CWE-918.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the code does not properly validate the input values for the `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` parameters. An attacker can potentially provide malicious values for these parameters, which can lead to a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.

For example, an attacker can provide a value for `book_format_from` that is a URL that points to a different host or port, and a value for `book_format_to` that is a URL that points to a different host or port. The code will then send a request to the target host or port, potentially bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attacker from accessing the URLs directly.

The code does not properly validate the input values, which allows an attacker to exploit this vulnerability.",1485,205,8.422745704650879

100,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code is using the `get_valid_filename` function from the `helper` module to generate a valid filename for the book title and author. The `get_valid_filename` function is designed to generate a valid filename by replacing any invalid characters with a valid replacement character. It is not vulnerable to CWE-918 because it is not using the `os.path.join` function to combine the path and normalize the path from Windows systems.

Additionally, the code is not using the `os.path.join` function to combine the path and normalize the path from Windows systems, which is the vulnerable part of the code. The `os.path.join` function is used to combine two or more path components into a single path, while normalizing the separators and checking that the path is absolute. If the path is not absolute, it will be normalized to be absolute. The `os.path.join` function is vulnerable to CWE-918 because it does not check if the path is absolute or not, and it does not normalize the separators.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918 because it is not using the `os.path.join` function to combine the path and normalize the path from Windows systems.",2027,300,12.466448545455933
