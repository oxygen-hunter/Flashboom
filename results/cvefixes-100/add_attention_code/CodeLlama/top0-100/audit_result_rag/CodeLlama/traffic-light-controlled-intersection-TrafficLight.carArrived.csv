The code is using the `force_text` and `force_str` functions to escape the `reason` parameter before using it in the `json.dumps` function. This ensures that the `reason` parameter is properly escaped and cannot be used to inject malicious code.

Furthermore, the code is also using the `urlencode` function to properly encode the `error_params` dictionary before using it in the `redirect_to_login` function. This ensures that the `error_params` dictionary is properly encoded and cannot be used to inject malicious code.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-79.",1974,163,6.210761785507202
89,CWE-22,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22.

The code is using the `os.path.join()` function to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory. The `os.path.join()` function is used to concatenate two or more pathname components, and it is designed to handle special elements such as "".."" and ""/"" separators.

The `send_file()` function is used to send a file to the client, and it takes a pathname as an argument. The pathname is used to identify the file that is to be sent. The `send_file()` function is designed to handle special elements such as "".."" and ""/"" separators, and it is intended to be used with pathnames that are intended to identify files or directories that are located underneath a restricted parent directory.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-22, as it is using the `os.path.join()` function to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, and it is using the `send_file()` function to send the file to the client.",734,270,9.98692774772644

The code is using the `os.path.join()` function to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory. The `os.path.join()` function is used to concatenate two or more pathname components, and it is designed to handle special elements such as "".."" and ""/"" separators.

The `os.path.join()` function is not vulnerable to CWE-22 because it properly neutralizes special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory. The `os.path.join()` function is designed to handle relative path traversal and absolute path traversal, and it is not vulnerable to CWE-22.
