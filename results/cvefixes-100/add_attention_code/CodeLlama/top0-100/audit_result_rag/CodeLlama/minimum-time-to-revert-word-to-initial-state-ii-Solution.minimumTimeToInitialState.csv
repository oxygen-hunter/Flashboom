Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-22.",848,133,4.885159730911255
90,CWE-22,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22. The function `backup_download` does not use user-controlled input to construct a pathname, and it does not allow the user to access files or directories outside of the restricted directory. The function `minimumTimeToInitialState` is a different function that is not related to the vulnerability.",840,81,2.950655460357666
91,CWE-918,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to the CWE-918 vulnerability. The code is using the `send_file` function from the Flask framework to send a file to the client, and it is not using any user-controlled variables in the `send_file` function call. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the CWE-918 vulnerability.",835,85,3.3763880729675293
92,CWE-22,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22. The function `swaggerui_static` is not used in the `minimumTimeToInitialState` function, and the `minimumTimeToInitialState` function does not use the `swaggerui_static` function. Therefore, the `swaggerui_static` function is not vulnerable to CWE-22.",888,88,3.2555294036865234
93,CWE-22,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22. The function `swaggerui_static` is not using user-controlled input to construct a pathname, and it is not using the `send_file` function to read a file. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-22.",880,72,2.8121936321258545
94,CWE-918,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The function `swaggerui_static` is not responsible for handling user input, and it does not involve any user-controlled data. The function `minimumTimeToInitialState` is a separate function that is not related to the vulnerability.",875,70,2.6706058979034424
95,CWE-79,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `mark_safe()` method in the `LocationTable` class, which allows untrusted data to be rendered as HTML. This can lead to the execution of malicious script in the context of the web browser, potentially allowing an attacker to steal sensitive information or perform other malicious actions.

The vulnerability is described in the CVE-2023-48705 and CWE-79 descriptions provided earlier.",2472,130,5.139429807662964
96,CWE-918,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the code retrieves the contents of a URL provided by the user, without validating the URL or ensuring that it is being sent to the expected destination. This allows an attacker to make it appear as if the server is sending the request, possibly bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly.

The vulnerability can be exploited by providing URLs to unexpected hosts or ports, which can be used to conduct port scanning of hosts in internal networks, use other URLs such as that can access documents on the system (using file://), or use other protocols such as gopher:// or tftp://, which may provide greater control over the contents of requests.

The vulnerability can be mitigated by validating the URL and ensuring that it is being sent to the expected destination. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed hosts and ports, or by using a library that provides a secure way to send requests to external hosts.",1484,245,9.068258285522461

98,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code checks if the `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` form fields are present in the request, and if not, it returns an error message. It does not allow the user to specify arbitrary URLs or ports for the conversion.

The vulnerability CWE-918 is related to the use of external resources, such as URLs, and the lack of proper validation and sanitization of user input. The code does not use external resources, and it does not allow the user to specify arbitrary URLs or ports for the conversion. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",1350,154,5.917536973953247

The code is using the `os.path.join` function to combine the `author_dir` and `title_dir` variables, which are both user-supplied strings. However, the code is not using the `os.path.join` function to validate the input strings, and it is not checking for any invalid characters in the input strings.
