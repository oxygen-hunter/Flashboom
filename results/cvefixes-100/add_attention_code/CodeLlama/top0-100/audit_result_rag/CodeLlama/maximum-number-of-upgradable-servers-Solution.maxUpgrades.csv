The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory. However, the `os.path.join` function is used to construct the pathname, and the `send_file` function is used to send the file to the client, which is a different operation that does not involve reading the file from the file system. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-22.",740,158,6.1939122676849365
91,CWE-918,"  NO. The code you provided is not vulnerable to the CWE-918 vulnerability. The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct the file path, which ensures that the file path is valid and does not contain any malicious characters. Additionally, the `send_file` function is used to send the file to the client, which ensures that the file is sent securely and does not contain any malicious code. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to the CWE-918 vulnerability.",735,117,5.2005088329315186
92,CWE-22,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22. The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory. The `os.path.join` function is designed to handle special elements such as "".."" and ""/"" separators, and it properly neutralizes them to prevent path traversal attacks.

94,CWE-918,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The function `swaggerui_static` is not responsible for handling user input and does not involve any user-controlled variables. The function `maxUpgrades` is a pure function that takes in four lists of integers and returns a list of integers. It does not involve any user-controlled variables or external requests. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",775,100,4.132893085479736
95,CWE-79,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-79.

The code is using the `mark_safe()` method to render the custom field values, which is the correct way to do it. The `mark_safe()` method is used to mark a string as safe for use in an HTML context, which means that it will not be escaped and will be rendered as is.

The code is also using the `get_cell()` method to retrieve the rendered value of the custom field, which is the correct way to do it. The `get_cell()` method returns the rendered value of the cell, which is the result of the `render_to_string()` method.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-79.",2372,165,6.993353366851807
96,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code is using the `filter` method to filter the results of a query based on a specific condition. The condition is based on the `db_type` variable, which is a string that can take on the values ""languages"", ""custom"", ""author"", ""series"", or ""publisher"". The `filter` method is used to filter the results based on the value of the `db_type` variable.

The code is not vulnerable to CWE-918 because the `filter` method is used to filter the results based on a specific condition, and the condition is based on a variable that is not user-controlled. The `filter` method is not vulnerable to SQL injection attacks because it is not using a user-controlled variable to construct the SQL query.

The code is using the `request.form.get()` method to retrieve the values of the `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` form fields, and it is checking if both values are not None before proceeding with the conversion. This means that the code is properly validating the input and preventing the vulnerability.",1250,91,3.706334352493286
99,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code checks if the `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` form fields are present in the request, and if not, it returns an error message. It does not allow the user to specify arbitrary URLs or ports for the conversion.

The vulnerability CWE-918 is related to the use of external resources, such as URLs or ports, in a web application. If an attacker can control the values of these resources, they can potentially use them to bypass access controls or perform other malicious actions. However, the given code does not allow the user to specify arbitrary URLs or ports, and instead uses the `helper.convert_book_format` function to perform the conversion. This function is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",1250,185,7.062353134155273

The code is using the `os.path.join` function to combine the `author_dir` and `title_dir` variables, which are both user-supplied values. However, the code is not using the `os.path.join` function in a way that could allow an attacker to manipulate the path to a file on the server.

The `os.path.join` function is used to combine two or more path components into a single path, and it does not allow an attacker to manipulate the path to a file on the server. The function is designed to handle invalid characters in the path, and it will raise an exception if an invalid character is encountered.
