The vulnerability is caused by the `minStartingIndex` function, which takes a string `s` and a pattern `pattern` as input, and returns the index of the first occurrence of the pattern in the string. The function uses the Z-function to compute the minimum starting index of the pattern in the string.

The Z-function is computed using the `z_function` function, which takes the concatenation of the pattern and the string as input. The function then computes the Z-function for the concatenated string.

The vulnerability arises when the pattern is a URL or a hostname, and the string is a URL or a hostname that is not the expected destination. In this case, the Z-function will return a value that is greater than the length of the pattern, indicating that the pattern is present in the string at a position that is not the expected starting index.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a URL or a hostname that is not the expected destination, and then using the Z-function to make it appear that the server is sending the request to the expected destination. This can allow the attacker to bypass access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attacker from accessing the URLs directly.

The `redirect_to_login` function is used to redirect the user to the login page with the error message as a query parameter. The `urlencode` function is used to encode the error message, which is then used in the query parameter.

The `urlencode` function is used to encode the error message in a way that is safe for use in a URL. It is not vulnerable to CWE-79 because it is not possible to inject malicious code into the error message using this function.

98,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to the CWE-918 vulnerability.

The code is using the `z_function` algorithm to find the starting index of a pattern in a string. The `z_function` algorithm is a linear time algorithm that calculates the z-function of a string, which is a function that tells the maximum length of the suffix that is also a prefix of the string. The `z_function` algorithm is used to find the starting index of a pattern in a string by comparing the z-function of the pattern and the string.

The vulnerability CWE-918 is related to the use of the `z_function` algorithm in a way that allows an attacker to bypass access controls. The vulnerability occurs when the `z_function` algorithm is used to find the starting index of a pattern in a string, and the pattern is a URL or a hostname. If the attacker can control the pattern, they can use the `z_function` algorithm to make it appear as if the server is sending a request to an unexpected host or port, potentially bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly.

However, the given code does not use the `z_function` algorithm in a way that allows an attacker to bypass access controls. The code only uses the `z_function` algorithm",1375,301,11.010377407073975
