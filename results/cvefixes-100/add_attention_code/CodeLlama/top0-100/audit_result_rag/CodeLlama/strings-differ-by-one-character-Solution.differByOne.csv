The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `any` method in the `filter` function, which allows an attacker to specify a list of values that the `format` field of the `Data` model should be equal to. This allows an attacker to bypass the access controls of the system by specifying a list of values that are not actually present in the `Data` model.

For example, an attacker could specify a list of values that are not actually present in the `Data` model, and the `any` method would return `True` for any value that is present in the list, even if it is not actually present in the `Data` model. This could allow an attacker to access data that they are not authorized to access.

To fix this vulnerability, the `any` method should be replaced with the `all` method, which returns `True` only if all values in the list are present in the `Data` model.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `differByOne` function does not correctly perform the check on the `dict` parameter.

84,CWE-352,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-352. The code is using the `json` parameter to pass a JSON payload to the `client.post()` method, which is correctly validated by FastAPI. The `json` parameter is only used for JSON payloads, and the `data` parameter is only used for form data. The code is not using the `data` parameter to pass a JSON payload, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-352.",1437,107,4.192006587982178
85,CWE-290,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to a CWE-290 attack.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of unsanitized user input in the `json.loads()` function, which allows an attacker to inject malicious data and execute arbitrary code. The `json.loads()` function does not perform any input validation or sanitization, which means that any input provided by the user can be executed as code.

In this case, the attacker can provide a malicious `allowlist` parameter that contains a JSON object with a key of `exclude` and a value of a regular expression that matches any string. When the `valid_exclude_list()` function is called with this malicious input, it will return `True` and allow the attacker to bypass the intended validation mechanism.

To fix this vulnerability, the `json.loads()` function should be replaced with a sanitized version of the function that performs input validation and sanitization. Additionally, the `valid_exclude_list()` function should be updated to properly validate the `exclude` key and its value.",811,239,8.812465906143188

The loop is using the `len(buf)` variable to determine when to exit the loop, and it is not possible for the loop to be infinite. Additionally, the code is not using any user input or external data, so it is not vulnerable to a DoS attack.",1007,99,3.736382007598877
87,CWE-444,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to CWE-444.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `smuggle_url` function, which allows an attacker to add arbitrary HTTP headers to the request made by the `yt-dlp` tool. This can allow the attacker to set a proxy for the request, which can be used to MITM the request and exfiltrate cookies.

The `smuggle_url` function is used to add a `Referer` header to the request, which is set to `https://storyfire.com/`. This header is used to bypass the Same Origin Policy and allow the request to be made to a different domain. However, this header can be modified by an attacker to point to a different domain, which can allow the attacker to MITM the request and exfiltrate cookies.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have access to the `yt-dlp` tool and be able to modify the `smuggle_url` function to set a proxy for the request. Once the attacker has successfully MITM'ed the request, they can exfiltrate cookies by modifying the response to include the cookie that they want to steal.

It is important to note that this vulnerability is not present in the latest version of `yt-dlp`,",1804,301,11.383948802947998
