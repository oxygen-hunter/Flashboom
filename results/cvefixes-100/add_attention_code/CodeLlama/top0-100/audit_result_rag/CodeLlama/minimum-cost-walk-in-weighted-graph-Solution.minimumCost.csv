The vulnerability is due to the fact that the `adv_search_serie` function does not properly validate the input parameters `include_series_inputs` and `exclude_series_inputs`. An attacker can potentially exploit this vulnerability by providing malicious input values that can cause the server to retrieve data from unexpected hosts or ports, potentially bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly.

The `minimumCost` function, on the other hand, is not vulnerable to CWE-918 because it properly validates the input parameters `n`, `edges`, and `query`, and it uses the `UnionFind` class to perform the union operation. However, the `UnionFind` class does not properly validate the input parameters `n`, `edges`, and `query`, which can lead to errors in the computation of the minimum cost.",1090,214,8.228822231292725
10,CWE-918,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-918.

The vulnerability is due to the fact that the code does not properly validate the input parameters before using them in a query. Specifically, the `adv_search_serie` function takes in a list of `include_series_inputs` and `exclude_series_inputs` as input, and then uses these inputs to filter the results of a query. However, the code does not properly validate the contents of these lists, and instead assumes that the input is correct.

An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by providing malicious input to the `include_series_inputs` and `exclude_series_inputs` parameters. For example, an attacker could provide a list of series IDs that are not actually part of the database, or a list of series IDs that are not intended to be excluded. By doing so, the attacker could potentially bypass access controls and retrieve data that they are not authorized to access.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly validate the input parameters before using them in a query. This can be done by using a library such as `sqlalchemy` to validate the input parameters, or by implementing custom validation logic that ensures that the input parameters are correct.",1090,280,10.649506568908691

The vulnerability is due to the fact that the `UnionFind` class does not correctly perform the authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. The `union_set` method does not correctly update the `w` attribute of the `UnionFind` object, which allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.

The `cost` method of the `UnionFind` class is also vulnerable to this issue, as it does not correctly calculate the cost of the union operation. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.

In the `union_set` method, the `w` parameter is not properly used to determine the cost of the union operation. The `w` parameter is used to determine the cost of the union operation, but it is not properly updated after the union operation is performed.

69,CWE-93,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a CWE-93 vulnerability. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `str()` function to convert the `value` parameter to a string, which can result in a CRLF attack. The `str()` function does not filter out the CRLF sequence, and it can be exploited to inject malicious code.

The CVE-ID for this vulnerability is CVE-2016-9964. The CWE-ID for this vulnerability is CWE-93.

The CVE description is: ""redirect() in bottle.py in bottle 0.12.10 doesn't filter a ""\\r\\n"" sequence, which leads to a CRLF attack, as demonstrated by a redirect(""233\\r\\nSet-Cookie: name=salt"") call.""

70,CWE-93,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a CWE-93 vulnerability. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `replace` method to replace the underscore character with a hyphen, which can lead to a CRLF attack.

The `replace` method does not perform any special handling for the carriage return and line feed characters, which can cause the input to be interpreted as a CRLF sequence. This can lead to a redirect to a malicious URL, which can be used to steal sensitive information or perform other malicious actions.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input that contains a CRLF sequence, such as ""233\r\nSet-Cookie: name=salt"". This will cause the input to be interpreted as a redirect to a malicious URL, which can be used to steal sensitive information or perform other malicious actions.

To fix the vulnerability, the `replace` method should be replaced with a more secure method that properly handles the carriage return and line feed characters, such as the `re.sub` method with the `re.DOTALL` flag. This will ensure that the input is properly sanitized and cannot be exploited by a CRLF attack.",857,272,10.622890710830688
71,CWE-93,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a CWE-93 vulnerability. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `str` function to convert the `value` parameter to a string, which can result in a CRLF attack. The `str` function does not properly handle the `\r\n` sequence, which can be used to inject a carriage return and line feed character into the string. This can cause the `append` method to interpret the string as a new line, which can lead to a CRLF attack.

The `UnionFind` class in the `minimumCost` method also has a vulnerability, as it does not properly handle the `&` operator when combining the `w` attribute with the `w` parameter of the `union_set` method. This can allow an attacker to manipulate the `w` attribute and potentially cause a CRLF attack.

To fix these vulnerabilities, the `append` method should use the `str.format` method to properly handle the `\r\n` sequence, and the `UnionFind` class should use the `and` operator instead of the `&` operator to combine the `w` attribute with the `w` parameter of the `union_set` method.",903,267,9.97512435913086
72,CWE-93,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a CWE-93 vulnerability. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `del` statement to delete an element from a dictionary, which can lead to a race condition if multiple threads are accessing the same dictionary simultaneously.

In the given code, the `filter` function is called with a list of names, and it uses a `for` loop to iterate over the names. For each name, it checks if the name is in the dictionary and if it is, it deletes it. The problem is that if multiple threads are calling the `filter` function simultaneously, they may both try to delete the same name from the dictionary, which can lead to a race condition.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use a lock to synchronize access to the dictionary. For example, you can use the `threading.Lock` class to create a lock object and use it to protect access to the dictionary. Here is an example of how you can modify the `filter` function to use a lock:
```
def filter(self, names):
    with lock:
        for name in [_hkey(n) for n in names]:
            if name in self.dict:
                del self.dict[name]
```
This will ensure that only one thread can access the dictionary at a time, which will prevent race conditions.

The CVE-ID for this vulnerability is CVE-2016-9964. The CWE-ID for this vulnerability is CWE-93.

The extended description provides more information about the vulnerability, including the specific attack that can be performed. The attack involves injecting a CRLF sequence in the `redirect()` function, which can cause the function to redirect the user to a malicious website.

74,CWE-79,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-79.

The vulnerability is caused by the `test_security_check` function, which uses the `is_safe_url` function from Django's `utils/http.py` module to check if a URL is safe for redirection. However, this function does not properly sanitize the URL, which allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the URL and potentially execute it.

For example, an attacker could inject a URL with a scheme that is not HTTP or HTTPS, such as `javascript:alert(1)` or `data:text/html,<script>alert(1)</script>`. This would cause the `is_safe_url` function to return `True`, even though the URL is not safe for redirection.

To fix this vulnerability, the `test_security_check` function should properly sanitize the URL before passing it to the `is_safe_url` function. This can be done by using a library such as `urllib.parse` to parse the URL and extract the scheme, and then checking if the scheme is HTTP or HTTPS. If the scheme is not HTTP or HTTPS, the function should return `False`, indicating that the URL is not safe for redirection.",2811,282,10.742763042449951
