2,CWE-918,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The code is using the `urlparse` library to parse the URL and extract the hostname, and then using the `socket.gethostbyname` function to resolve the hostname to an IP address. The code is then using the `ipaddress.ip_address` function to create an IPAddress object from the IP address string, and finally calling the `is_private` method on the IPAddress object to check if the IP address is private.

The `is_private` method is a method of the `IPAddress` class that checks if the IP address is a private IP address, which is defined as any IP address in the range of 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, or 192.168.0.0/16. The code is using the `ipaddress.ip_address` function to create an IPAddress object from the IP address string, and then calling the `is_private` method on the IPAddress object to check if the IP address is private.

The `join` method is used to concatenate the `config_trustedhosts` string with the `Content-Security-Policy` header, which is a valid way to set the header value. The code is also using the `strip` method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the `config_trustedhosts` string, which is also a valid way to set the header value.

The `Content-Security-Policy` header is used to specify the allowed sources of content, and the code is not specifying the allowed sources of content correctly. The code is allowing any source of content to be loaded, which is not a secure configuration.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should be updated to specify the allowed sources of content correctly. This can be done by using the `Content-Security-Policy` header to specify the allowed sources of content, and by using the `default-src` directive to specify the default source of content. For example, the code could be updated to use the following `Content-Security-Policy` header:

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `str` function to convert the `value` parameter to a string. This can lead to a potential security issue if the `value` parameter is a user-supplied string that contains a carriage return character (ASCII code 13) followed by a line feed character (ASCII code 10). When the `str` function is used to convert this string, it will convert the carriage return character to a newline character, which can lead to a security issue if the newline character is used to inject malicious code.

For example, if the `value` parameter is set to ""13\nSet-Cookie: name=salt"", the `str` function will convert the carriage return character to a newline character, which will result in the injection of the malicious code ""Set-Cookie: name=salt"" into the HTTP response. This can lead to a security issue if the malicious code is used to steal sensitive information or take control of the user's session.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should use the `unicode` function to convert the `value` parameter to a Unicode string, and then use the `encode` function to convert the Unicode string to a byte string.

The function uses these inputs to construct a query that is sent to the database, which could potentially lead to a SQL injection attack if the input is malicious.

To fix this vulnerability, the function should validate and sanitize the input parameters before using them in the query. This can be done by using a library such as SQLAlchemy to construct the query, or by using a parameterized query to avoid SQL injection attacks.",1283,232,8.606014966964722
92,CWE-22,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22. The code is using the `os.path.join` function to construct a path to a file, and the `send_file` function to send the file to the client. The `os.path.join` function is properly sanitizing the input by joining the path components with the appropriate separator, and the `send_file` function is properly validating the file path before sending it to the client. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-22.",1336,118,4.434370994567871
93,CWE-22,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-22. The function `swaggerui_static` is not used in the `highestRankedKItems` function, and it does not contain any code that could be used to read or write files. The `highestRankedKItems` function is a Python function that takes in a grid, a pricing range, a starting point, and a number of items to return, and it returns the highest-ranked items in the grid that are within the pricing range and at most k items away from the starting point. It does not involve any file operations or external input.",1328,138,5.173174142837524
94,CWE-918,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The function `swaggerui_static` is not used in the code snippet provided, so it is not relevant to the vulnerability. The function `highestRankedKItems` is used to find the highest-ranked k items in a grid based on a pricing range. It does not involve any user-controlled input, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-918.",1323,103,4.0028369426727295
95,CWE-79,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `mark_safe()` method in the `LocationTable` class, which allows untrusted data to be rendered as HTML. This can lead to the execution of malicious scripts in the context of the web browser, potentially allowing an attacker to steal sensitive information or perform other malicious actions.

The specific vulnerability is caused by the `custom_column_expected` dictionary, which contains user-supplied data that is not properly sanitized before being rendered as HTML. An attacker could potentially inject malicious script into this data, which would be executed by the web browser when the page is rendered.

To fix this vulnerability, the `LocationTable` class should use appropriate sanitization techniques, such as HTML encoding or template escaping, to ensure that the untrusted data is properly protected from being executed as HTML. Additionally, the `custom_column_expected` dictionary should be properly sanitized before being used in the `LocationTable` class.",2920,239,9.135215759277344
96,CWE-918,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The vulnerability is related to the use of user-supplied data in the `add_objects` function, but the code does not appear to be using user-supplied data in the `highestRankedKItems` function.",1932,68,2.676149845123291
97,CWE-918,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The vulnerability is related to the use of user-supplied data in the `add_objects` function, but the code does not appear to be using user-supplied data in the `highestRankedKItems` function.",1932,68,2.7736928462982178
98,CWE-918,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The vulnerability is related to the use of user-supplied input in the `convert_bookformat` function, but the code does not appear to be using user-supplied input in the `highestRankedKItems` function.",1798,69,2.6660139560699463
99,CWE-918,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The vulnerability is related to the use of user-supplied input in the `convert_bookformat` function, but the code does not appear to be using user-supplied input in the `highestRankedKItems` function.",1798,69,2.690250873565674
100,CWE-918,"  NO. The code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The vulnerability is related to the use of `os.path.join` to combine the path and normalize it from Windows systems, but the code does not use `os.path.join` to combine the path and normalize it from Windows systems. Instead, it uses `helper.get_valid_filename` to get a valid filename, which is a different function that does not have the same vulnerability.",2340,104,4.175775051116943
