1,CWE-918,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

The vulnerability is caused by the `requests_session.request()` method, which allows an attacker to send a request to any URL they want, potentially bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly.

The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker provides a URL that is not a valid URL, but rather a URL that is not accessible from the outside world, such as a private IP address. The `is_private_address()` function is used to check if the URL is a private address, and if it is, the code raises an exception. However, this does not prevent the attacker from sending a request to the private address, which could potentially bypass the access control.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the URL is a valid URL and that it is accessible from the outside world before sending the request. Additionally, the code should not allow the attacker to provide a URL that is not a valid URL, but rather should raise an exception if the URL is not a valid URL.","

The vulnerability is caused by the `outerTrees` function, which takes a list of points as input and returns a list of points that form the convex hull of the input points. The function uses the 2D cross product of two vectors to determine the orientation of the points. However, the function does not properly handle the case where the points are collinear, which can lead to a potential SSRF vulnerability.

In particular, the function assumes that the cross product of two vectors is positive if the vectors make a counter-clockwise turn, and negative if the vectors make a clockwise turn. However, if the points are collinear, the cross product will be zero, and the function will not be able to determine the orientation of the points. This can lead to a potential SSRF vulnerability if an attacker can provide a set of points that are collinear and form a loop, which can cause the function to loop indefinitely and potentially lead to a denial-of-service or other types of attacks.

To fix the vulnerability, the function should properly handle the case where the points are collinear by using a different method to determine the orientation of the points, such as using the 3D cross product or a different method that can handle collinear points.","

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the code retrieves the contents of a URL provided by the user, without verifying that the URL is valid or that it is being sent to the expected destination. This allows an attacker to make the server send requests to arbitrary URLs, potentially bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attacker from accessing the URLs directly.

The function calculates the 2D cross product of two vectors, which can be used to determine the orientation of the vectors. However, the function does not properly handle the case where the vectors are collinear, which can lead to a false positive result.

In the `outerTrees` function, the `cross` function is used to calculate the orientation of the vectors. However, if the vectors are collinear, the function will return a zero value, which can be interpreted as a positive value. This can lead to a false positive result, as the function will return the same result for both clockwise and counter-clockwise turns.

To fix the vulnerability, the `cross` function should be modified to properly handle the case where the vectors are collinear. One way to do this is to check if the vectors are collinear before calculating the cross product. If the vectors are collinear, the function should return a negative value to indicate that the turn is counter-clockwise.

Another way to fix the vulnerability is to use a different method to determine the orientation of the vectors. For example, the `outerTrees` function could use the determinant of the matrix formed by the vectors to determine the orientation. This method would not be affected by","

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

76,CWE-284,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-284.

The vulnerability is in the `outerTrees` function, which is used to compute the convex hull of a set of points. The function uses the 2D cross product of vectors to determine the orientation of the points. However, the function does not properly handle the case where the points are collinear, which can lead to a vulnerability.

In particular, the function assumes that the cross product of two vectors is positive if the vectors make a counter-clockwise turn, and negative if they make a clockwise turn. However, if the vectors are collinear, the cross product is zero, but the function does not properly handle this case. This can lead to a vulnerability if an attacker can control the points in the set, and can manipulate the cross product to cause the function to return an incorrect result.

For example, an attacker could craft a set of points that are collinear, but have a different orientation than the original points. The function would then return an incorrect result, potentially allowing the attacker to bypass security checks or perform other malicious actions.

Therefore, it is important to properly handle the case where the points are collinear in the `outerTrees` function, and to ensure that the function returns the correct result in all cases.","

                  Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.
                  Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings).

The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

The request data is now parsed as JSON only if the content-type header is application/json or another JSON compatible media type like application/geo+json. It's best to upgrade to the latest FastAPI, but if updating is not possible then a middleware or a dependency that checks the content-type header and aborts the request if it is not application/json or another JSON compatible content type can act as a mitigating workaround.""}]

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

96,CWE-918,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the code retrieves the contents of a URL provided by the user, without verifying that the URL is valid or that it is being sent to the expected destination. This allows an attacker to send a request to a URL that is not intended to be accessed by the server, potentially bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attacker from accessing the URL directly.

The vulnerability is caused by the following line of code:
```
db_element = db_session.query(db_object).filter(db_filter == add_element).first()
```
The `db_filter` variable is set to `db_object.lang_code` if `db_type` is `'languages'`, `db_object.value` if `db_type` is `'custom'`, and `db_object.name` otherwise. The `add_element` variable is a user-provided value that is used to filter the results of the query.

An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by providing a URL that is not intended to be accessed by the server, but is instead a URL that can be accessed by the attacker. For example, the attacker could provide a URL that is on a different host or","

CWE description:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

By providing URLs to unexpected hosts or ports, attackers can make it appear that the server is sending the request, possibly bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly. The server can be used as a proxy to conduct port scanning of hosts in internal networks, use other URLs such as that can access documents on the system (using file://), or use other protocols such as gopher:// or tftp://, which may provide greater control over the contents of requests.

98,CWE-918,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

The vulnerability is caused by the `outerTrees` function, which takes a list of points as input and returns a list of points that form the convex hull of the input points. The function uses the 2D cross product of two vectors to determine the orientation of the points. However, the function does not properly validate the input points, which allows an attacker to send a malicious request that can cause the server to send a request to an unexpected host or port.

For example, an attacker can send a request with a list of points that contains a point with a malicious URL, such as `http://example.com/`. The server will then send a request to `http://example.com/` to retrieve the contents of the URL, which can potentially lead to a server-side request forgery attack.

To fix the vulnerability, the `outerTrees` function should properly validate the input points to ensure that they are valid and do not contain any malicious data. This can be done by checking the format of the points and ensuring that they are within the expected range of values. Additionally, the function should not send any requests to unexpected hosts or ports, and should instead return an error message to the user if it detects any malicious data in the input points.","
