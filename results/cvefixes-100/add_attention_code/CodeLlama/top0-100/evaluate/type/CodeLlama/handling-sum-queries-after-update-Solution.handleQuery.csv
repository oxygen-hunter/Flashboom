1,CWE-918,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.

The vulnerability is caused by the `requests` library being used to make HTTP requests to the given endpoint. This allows an attacker to send a request to any URL they choose, potentially bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attacker from accessing the URLs directly.

The code checks if the URL is a private address and raises an exception if it is, but this does not prevent the attacker from sending a request to a private address. Additionally, the code does not validate the URL before making the request, which could allow an attacker to send a request to an unexpected host or port.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate the URL before making the request and ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed hosts or by using a library that provides additional security features such as SSL/TLS encryption.","

4,CWE-601,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a CWE-601 (Insecure Deserialization) issue.

The `handleQuery` function takes in a list of queries, where each query is a list of three integers. The first integer represents the type of query, and the second and third integers represent the range of the query.

The `SegmentTree` class is used to perform range queries on the list of integers. The `build_fn` parameter is used to initialize the tree with the correct values, and the `query_fn` parameter is used to combine the values of two nodes. The `update_fn` parameter is used to update the values of a node.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `build_fn` parameter is not properly sanitizing the input values. Specifically, it is using the `^` operator to XOR the values of two nodes, which can result in unexpected behavior if the values are not integers.

For example, if the input values are `nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `nums2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the `build_fn` function will initialize the tree with the following values:

18,CWE-918,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

The code is vulnerable because it uses the `valid_email()` function to validate the email address provided by the user. However, this function does not perform any validation on the email address, and it simply checks if the email address is a valid email address format.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious email address that is not a valid email address format, but instead a URL that can be used to perform a server-side request forgery attack. For example, an attacker can provide an email address like `http://example.com` or `https://example.com`, which will be accepted by the `valid_email()` function as a valid email address.

Once the attacker has successfully exploited this vulnerability, they can use the server to perform a SSRF attack by sending a request to the URL provided in the email address. This can allow the attacker to access resources on the server that they would not otherwise have access to, such as sensitive data or other services.

Therefore, it is important to fix this vulnerability by implementing proper email address validation to prevent this type of attack.","

The vulnerability is caused by the `format_date` function, which takes a `datetime` object as input and formats it according to the specified format. However, the function does not properly validate the input, and it can be tricked into formatting dates from other hosts or ports.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious `pub_start` or `pub_end` parameter, which contains a date in a different format or a different host or port. For example, an attacker could provide a date in the format `http://example.com/date` instead of `2022-01-01`, which would cause the function to format the date from the `example.com` host instead of the expected `localhost` host.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to access resources on other hosts or ports, potentially leading to information disclosure or other types of attacks.","

The vulnerability is due to the fact that the code is using the `calibre_db.get_filtered_book()` method to retrieve the book information, which can be used to access external resources. The method takes a `book_id` parameter, which is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to provide a malicious value that can be used to access external resources.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly validate the `book_id` parameter to ensure that it is a valid book ID and not a malicious URL. Additionally, the code should use a whitelist of allowed book IDs to prevent any unauthorized access to external resources.","

The method takes a `book_id` parameter, which is used to identify the book to be retrieved.

The `calibre_db.get_filtered_book()` method would then retrieve the contents of the URL, potentially exposing sensitive information or executing malicious code.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should perform proper validation on the `book_id` parameter to ensure that it is a valid book ID.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `create_function` method in the `calibre_db.session.connection().connection.connection.create_function(""lower"", 1, db.lcase)` line. This method allows an attacker to create a new function that can be used to execute arbitrary code on the server.

The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to the server, which will execute the `create_function` method with a malicious function that can access the server's file system, network, or other sensitive resources.

For example, the attacker can send a request to the server with a malicious function that can execute a shell command on the server, allowing the attacker to read or write files, execute commands, or even gain access to sensitive data.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the developer should use a secure method to create functions, such as the `create_function` method provided by the `sqlite3` module in Python. Additionally, the developer should ensure that the function is properly validated and sanitized to prevent malicious input from being executed.","

The attacker can use this vulnerability to make it appear as if the server is sending the request, possibly bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attacker from accessing the URLs directly. The server can be used as a proxy to conduct port scanning of hosts in internal networks, use other URLs such as that can access documents on the system (using file://), or use other protocols such as gopher:// or tftp://, which may provide greater control over the contents of requests.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to access resources that are not intended to be accessed by the user, potentially leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or other types of attacks.","

The vulnerability is due to the fact that the code does not properly validate the input values before using them. Specifically, the `toggle_archived` function takes a `book_id` as input, which is then used to retrieve the book from the database. However, the function does not check if the `book_id` is a valid ID or if the book exists in the database. This means that an attacker could potentially provide a malicious `book_id` that could lead to a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack.

For example, an attacker could provide a `book_id` that is not a valid ID, but instead a URL or other string that could be used to make a request to an external server. If the `toggle_archived` function does not properly validate the input, it could retrieve the contents of the external server, potentially allowing the attacker to access sensitive information or perform other malicious actions.

To fix this vulnerability, the `toggle_archived` function should properly validate the input values before using them. This could include checking if the `book_id` is a valid ID, or if the book exists in the database.

The vulnerability is due to the use of the `update_fn` parameter in the `SegmentTree` constructor, which is used to update the values in the tree. The `update_fn` parameter is used to combine the values of two nodes in the tree, and the code uses the `lambda` function to define the `update_fn` parameter.

The `update_fn` parameter is used to update the values in the tree when the `update` method is called. The `update` method takes two arguments, `L` and `R`, which are the indices of the nodes to be updated. The `update_fn` parameter is used to combine the values of the nodes at indices `L` and `R` and update the value of the node at index `L`.

The vulnerability is that the `update_fn` parameter is not properly validated, and it can be used to bypass the intended access restrictions. For example, if the `update_fn` parameter is set to a function that always returns `None`, it will not update the values in the tree, but it will still allow the user to access the data.

The vulnerability is due to the fact that the `SegmentTree` class is using a custom `update_fn` function to update the tree, which is not correctly handling the case where the `val` argument is `None`. In this case, the `update_fn` function should simply return the current value of the node, without modifying it. However, the current implementation is returning `None` instead, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

For example, if the `update_fn` function is called with `val=None` and the current value of the node is `1`, the function will return `None` instead of `1`, which can cause the tree to become corrupted.

To fix this vulnerability, the `update_fn` function should be modified to return the current value of the node if `val` is `None`, and the `query_fn` function should be modified to handle the case where the result of the query is `None`.","

This could cause Synapse to make requests to internal infrastructure. The type of request was not controlled by the user, although limited modification of request bodies was possible. For the most thorough protection server administrators should remove the deprecated `federation_ip_range_blacklist` from their settings after upgrading to Synapse v1.25.0 which will result in Synapse using the improved default IP address restrictions.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `filter` function in the `handleQuery` method. The `filter` function is used to remove elements from a list, but it does not check if the element is actually present in the list before removing it. This can lead to a situation where an element is removed from the list, even if it is not present in the list.

For example, if the list `names` contains the elements ""Alice"", ""Bob"", and ""Charlie"", and the `filter` function is called with the argument ""David"", it will remove the element ""David"" from the list, even if it is not present in the list. This can lead to a situation where the list contains only the elements ""Alice"" and ""Bob"", even if the original list contained ""Charlie"" as well.

To fix this vulnerability, the `filter` function should be modified to check if the element is actually present in the list before removing it. This can be done by using the `in` operator to check if the element is present in the list, like this:
```

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `replace` method in the `dict` class, which does not properly handle Unicode characters. Specifically, the `replace` method replaces all occurrences of the `key` parameter with the `value` parameter, regardless of whether the `key` parameter is a Unicode character or not. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the `key` parameter is a Unicode character, as the `replace` method will replace the entire Unicode character with the `value` parameter, which may not be a valid Unicode character.

For example, if the `key` parameter is the Unicode character ""é"" (U+00E9), and the `value` parameter is the Unicode character ""a"" (U+0061), the `replace` method will replace the entire ""é"" character with the ""a"" character, resulting in the string ""a"" instead of the expected ""éa"". This can lead to unexpected behavior in the `handleQuery` method, as the `replace` method may replace valid Unicode characters with invalid ones, leading to incorrect results.

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The vulnerability is in the `handleQuery` function, specifically in the `update` function. The function updates the segment tree with the given query, which can be used to manipulate the values in the segment tree. The function uses the `update_fn` parameter to update the values in the segment tree, which can be set to any function that takes two arguments and returns a tuple of two values.

The vulnerability arises when the `update_fn` parameter is set to a function that always returns the same value, regardless of the input arguments. This means that the function will always return the same value for any query, which can be used to manipulate the values in the segment tree.

For example, if the `update_fn` parameter is set to a function that always returns `(1, 0)`, then the `update` function will always return `(1, 0)` for any query. This means that the values in the segment tree will always be set to `(1, 0)`, regardless of the input arguments.

This can be exploited to manipulate the values in the segment tree, which can be used to bypass the access control mechanism. For example, an attacker could set the `update_fn` parameter to a function that always returns `(1, 0)`, which would allow them to manipulate the values","

This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.
                  Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings).

The vulnerability is caused by the improper encoding or escaping of the data in the `prepare_plugin_docs_command` function. Specifically, the `response_format` parameter is not properly encoded or escaped, which allows an attacker to inject malicious data and potentially execute arbitrary commands on the host.

The `response_format` parameter is used to determine the format of the output of the `ansible-doc` command. However, the code does not properly encode or escape the value of the `response_format` parameter, which allows an attacker to inject malicious data and potentially execute arbitrary commands on the host.

For example, an attacker could send a request with a malicious `response_format` parameter that is not properly encoded or escaped, such as `response_format=json%20-j`. This would cause the `ansible-doc` command to be executed with the `-j` option, which could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the host.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly encode or escape the value of the `response_format` parameter before passing it to the `ansible-doc` command. This can be done by using the `urllib.parse.quote` function to properly encode the value of the `response_format` parameter.

Extended description:

            Improper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.
            Most products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, ""GET /index.html HTTP/1.1"" is a structured message containing a command (""GET"") with a single argument (""/index.html"") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (""HTTP/1.1"").
            If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

To fix this vulnerability, the `authenticate` function should properly validate the `username` and `password` before using them to authenticate the user. This can be done by using a regular expression to validate the `username` and `password`, or by using a more secure authentication mechanism such as OAuth.","

CWE description:
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `exec` function to execute code that is retrieved from an external source. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the program, which can then be executed with the same privileges as the program.

In this case, the `exec` function is used to execute code that is retrieved from the `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile` function, which is called with the `doc` parameter. This function retrieves a file from a specific location, and then executes the code in that file using the `exec` function.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `exec` function does not properly sanitize the code that is executed. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the `doc` parameter, which would then be executed by the `exec` function. This could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system, or to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the program.

To fix this vulnerability, the `exec` function should be used with caution, and the code that is executed should be thoroughly reviewed and tested to ensure that it is safe and secure.

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

CWE description:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

Extended description:

            Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as "".."" and ""/"" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the ""../"" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as ""/usr/local/bin"" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.

95,CWE-79,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `mark_safe()` method in the `rendered_value` variable. This method is used to mark a string as safe for use in a web page, but it does not actually sanitize the string. Instead, it simply marks the string as safe, which means that it will not be escaped or encoded in any way.

This means that if an attacker can control the value of the `rendered_value` variable, they can inject malicious script into the web page. This can be done by including a `<script>` tag in the value, which will be executed by the web browser when the page is rendered.

For example, if an attacker can control the value of the `rendered_value` variable and they inject a `<script>` tag with malicious code, the web page will execute the malicious code when the page is rendered. This can allow the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, sending malicious requests to other web sites, or even taking control of the victim's machine.

Therefore, it is important to sanitize the `rendered_value` variable before using it in the web page. This can be done by using a library such as `django.utils.safestring` to","

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.
