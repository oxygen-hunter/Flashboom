The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code blindly trusts the input from the user, without validating it. The `include_extension_inputs` and `exclude_extension_inputs` are user-provided inputs, and the code does not check if they are valid file extensions or not. This means that an attacker can potentially provide malicious inputs, such as ""exe"" or ""bat"", which could lead to a server-side request forgery attack.

The `isSolvable` function in the second code snippet also appears to be vulnerable to CWE-918. The function takes a list of words and a result as input, and it uses a backtracking algorithm to determine if the result can be formed by concatenating the words. However, the function does not validate the input, and it does not check if the words are valid or not. This means that an attacker can potentially provide malicious inputs, such as ""exe"" or ""bat"", which could lead to a server-side request forgery attack.

In both cases, the vulnerability is caused by the lack of input validation, which allows an attacker to provide malicious inputs that can be used to bypass security controls or perform unauthorized actions on the server.","

The `backtracking` function takes a list of words and a result string as input, and it tries to find a way to convert the words into the result string by performing a series of operations. The function uses a lookup table to keep track of the values of each character in the words, and it uses a set to keep track of the values that have already been used.

The vulnerability is in the way the function handles the `carry` variable. The `carry` variable is used to keep track of the carry over from one iteration to the next, but it is not properly initialized. If the `carry` variable is not properly initialized, it can cause the function to access memory outside of the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

For example, if the `words` list contains a word with a length of 100 characters, and the `result` string contains a length of 1000 characters, the function will try to access memory outside of the allocated buffer. This can cause the function to crash or produce unexpected results.

To fix the vulnerability, the `carry` variable should be properly initialized to 0 before the loop starts. Additionally, the function should check the length of the `words` list and the `result` string before accessing their elements, to prevent accessing memory outside of the allocated buffer","

This could lead to a potential vulnerability if the input is not a valid hexadecimal string, as it could cause the code to crash or produce incorrect results.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the input is a valid hexadecimal string before converting it. This can be done by using the `is_hex` function from the `eth_utils` library, which checks if a string is a valid hexadecimal string.

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

CWE description:
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

87,CWE-444,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-444.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `smuggle_url` function, which allows an attacker to add arbitrary HTTP headers to a request made by the `yt-dlp` tool. This can allow the attacker to manipulate the request in a way that is not intended by the tool, potentially leading to cookie exfiltration.

The `smuggle_url` function is used to add a `Referer` header to the request, which is set to `https://storyfire.com/`. This header is used to bypass the same-origin policy and allow the request to be made to a different domain. However, the `smuggle_url` function does not properly validate the URL being passed to it, which allows an attacker to add arbitrary headers to the request.

Therefore, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-444, as it allows an attacker to manipulate the request made by the `yt-dlp` tool in a way that is not intended by the tool, potentially leading to cookie exfiltration.","

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.

The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site.

The code is using the `filter` method to filter the results based on the `db_filter` variable, which is set to the `lang_code` attribute of the `db_object` if the `db_type` is 'languages', or the `value` attribute if the `db_type` is 'custom'. The `filter` method is used to retrieve the first element that matches the filter, and the code checks if the element is `None` before adding it to the `db_book_object`.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918, as it is not using the `filter` method to retrieve the contents of a URL or similar request, but rather to filter the results based on the attributes of the `db_object`.","

[{'lang': 'en', 'value': 'Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in GitHub repository janeczku/calibre-web prior to 0.6.18.'}]

CWE description:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

Extended description:
By providing URLs to unexpected hosts or ports, attackers can make it appear that the server is sending the request, possibly bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly. The server can be used as a proxy to conduct port scanning of hosts in internal networks, use other URLs such as that can access documents on the system (using file://), or use other protocols such as gopher:// or tftp://, which may provide greater control over the contents of requests.

100,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code is using the `os.path.join()` function to combine the `author_dir` and `title_dir` variables, which are both user-supplied strings. However, the code is not properly sanitizing the input strings, and it is not checking for any potential directory traversal attacks.

The `os.path.join()` function is designed to handle directory separators, and it will automatically add a separator character between the two input strings if necessary. However, the code is not using this function correctly, as it is not properly handling the case where the input strings contain directory separators.

For example, if the `title_dir` variable contains a string like ""../"", the `os.path.join()` function will automatically add a separator character between the two input strings, resulting in a path like ""author_dir/../title_dir"". This could potentially allow an attacker to access files outside of the expected directory, depending on the value of the `author_dir` variable.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly sanitize the input strings and ensure that they do not contain any directory separators. Additionally, the code should use the `os.path.join()` function correctly, by passing in the two input strings separately and not concatenating them manually.","
