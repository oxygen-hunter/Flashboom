However, the `primePalindrome` function is vulnerable to SSRF attacks. The function takes an integer `N` as input and returns the largest prime palindrome less than or equal to `N`.

The code is using the `func.upper(func.substr(ub.User.name, 1, 1))` to extract the first character of the user's name, and then grouping the results by that character. This is not vulnerable to CWE-918 because the code is not using the extracted character to make a request to an external host or port.

However, the code is using the `func.substr(ub.User.name, 1, 1)` to extract the first character of the user's name, which could potentially be used to bypass access controls. For example, if the user's name is ""admin"", the code would extract the character ""a"" and use it to make a request to the server. If the server is configured to allow access to the ""a"" character, the request could be successful, even if the user does not have the necessary permissions to access the resource.

Therefore, it is recommended to use a more secure method of extracting the first character of the user's name, such as using a regular expression to extract the first character, or using a more secure method of grouping the results by the first character.","

36,CWE-918,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `calibre_db.common_filters()` function, which allows an attacker to specify a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieve the contents of this URL. This can be used to bypass access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attacker from accessing the URL directly.

For example, an attacker could send a request to `http://192.168.1.1/secret_file.txt` and the server would retrieve the contents of this file, potentially allowing the attacker to access sensitive information.

To fix this vulnerability, the `calibre_db.common_filters()` function should be modified to ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination. This can be done by checking the URL against a whitelist of allowed domains or by using a more advanced filtering mechanism that ensures the request is being sent to a trusted destination.","

55,CWE-918,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the code retrieves the contents of a URL provided by the user, without verifying that the URL is valid or that it is being sent to the expected destination. This allows an attacker to send a request to any URL they want, potentially bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly.

For example, an attacker could send a request to a URL that is not intended to be accessed by the server, such as a URL on a different host or a URL that is not intended to be accessed by the server. The server would then retrieve the contents of this URL, potentially exposing sensitive information or causing the server to perform malicious actions.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should verify that the URL is valid and that it is being sent to the expected destination before retrieving its contents. This can be done by checking the URL against a list of valid URLs or by verifying that the URL is being sent to the expected destination using other means, such as checking the IP address of the client or the HTTP headers of the request.","

The `primePalindrome` function takes an integer `N` as input and returns the largest prime palindrome less than or equal to `N`. The function first checks if `N` is between 8 and 11, and if so, returns 11. Otherwise, it iterates over a range of numbers from 10^((len(str(N))//2)-1) to 10^5, and for each number `i`, it checks if the number `j` formed by concatenating the digits of `i` in both orders is prime and less than or equal to `N`. If such a number `j` is found, the function returns it.

The vulnerability in this code is that it does not correctly perform the authorization check. The function does not check if the user has the necessary permissions to access the resource, and it does not check if the user is authorized to perform the action. This allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform.

For example, an attacker could pass a value of `N` that is not between 8 and 11, but is still a prime palindrome, and the function would return the incorrect result. Similarly, an attacker could pass a value of `N` that","

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `append` method does not properly sanitize the input values before appending them to the dictionary. Specifically, the `value` parameter is not properly sanitized, and it is possible for an attacker to inject malicious code by providing a value that contains a carriage return (CR) character followed by a line feed (LF) character. This can lead to a CRLF attack, which can be used to execute arbitrary code on the server.

Therefore, the `append` method should be modified to properly sanitize the input values before appending them to the dictionary. This can be done by using a library such as `html.escape` to escape the input values, or by using a different method that is designed to sanitize input values.","

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

CWE description:
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request. This can be exploited by an attacker to trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server, which will be treated as an authentic request.

In this case, the code is vulnerable because it does not check the content-type header of the request, and it does not properly verify whether the request body is a valid JSON payload. An attacker could send a request with a content type of text/plain containing a JSON payload, which would be accepted and the JSON payload would be extracted. This could result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should properly check the content-type header of the request and only accept requests with a content type of application/json or another JSON compatible media type. It should also properly verify whether the request body is a valid JSON payload.","

FastAPI versions lower than 0.65.2 that used cookies for authentication in path operations that received JSON payloads sent by browsers were vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. In versions lower than 0.65.2, FastAPI would try to read the request payload as JSON even if the content-type header sent was not set to application/json or a compatible JSON media type (e.g. application/geo+json). A request with a content type of text/plain containing JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data would be extracted. Requests with content type text/plain are exempt from CORS preflights, for being considered Simple requests. The browser will execute them right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application. This is fixed in FastAPI 0.65.2. The request data is now parsed as JSON only if the content-type header is application/json or another JSON compatible media type like application/geo+json. It's best to upgrade to the latest FastAPI, but if updating is not possible then a middleware or a dependency that checks the content-type header and aborts the request if it is not application/json or another JSON compatible content type can act as a mitigating workaround.""}]

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

98,CWE-918,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-918.

The vulnerability is due to the fact that the code does not properly validate the input values for the `book_format_from` and `book_format_to` parameters. An attacker can potentially exploit this vulnerability by providing malicious input values that can cause the server to retrieve data from unexpected hosts or ports, potentially bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly.

For example, an attacker could provide a malicious value for `book_format_from` that is a URL that points to a host or port that is not expected, such as a URL that points to a host on the internal network. The server would then retrieve the contents of this URL, potentially bypassing access controls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URL directly.

Additionally, the code does not properly validate the input values for `book_format_to`, which can also lead to vulnerabilities. For example, an attacker could provide a malicious value for `book_format_to` that is a URL that points to a host or port that is not expected, such as a URL that points to a host on the internal network. The server would then retrieve the contents of this URL, potentially bypassing access controls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URL directly.
