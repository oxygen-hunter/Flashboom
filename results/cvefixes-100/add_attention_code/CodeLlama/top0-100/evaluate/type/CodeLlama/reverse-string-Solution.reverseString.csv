The code checks if the URL is a private address and raises an exception if it is, which means it does not allow the user to access private addresses. Additionally, it gets authentication values if not given and then calls the `requests` library to get the response from the given endpoint. The code also checks the response status code and returns an error if it is not 200.

Therefore, the code does not allow the user to bypass access controls by providing URLs to unexpected hosts or ports. It only allows the user to access public addresses and does not allow the user to access private addresses.","

CWE description:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

Extended description:
By providing URLs to unexpected hosts or ports, attackers can make it appear that the server is sending the request, possibly bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly. The server can be used as a proxy to conduct port scanning of hosts in internal networks, use other URLs such as that can access documents on the system (using file://), or use other protocols such as gopher:// or tftp://, which may provide greater control over the contents of requests.

The code does not use the `urllib` library to retrieve the contents of a URL, and it does not use the `requests` library to send a request to an upstream component. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to SSRF.

However, the code does use the `valid_email` function to validate the email address provided by the user, which could potentially be vulnerable to email address harvesting attacks. Additionally, the code does not properly handle the `kindle_mail` field, which could potentially be used to bypass access controls.","

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the code retrieves the contents of a URL provided by the user, without properly validating the URL or ensuring that it is being sent to the expected destination. This allows an attacker to provide a URL that points to a host or port that is not intended to be accessed by the server, potentially bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly.

For example, an attacker could provide a URL that points to a host or port that is not accessible from the server's network, or that is not intended to be accessed by the server. The server would then attempt to retrieve the contents of the URL, potentially resulting in the server being used as a proxy to conduct port scanning of hosts in internal networks, or use other URLs such as that can access documents on the system (using file://), or use other protocols such as gopher:// or tftp://, which may provide greater control over the contents of requests.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to perform malicious actions on the server. It is recommended to validate the URL and ensure that it is being sent to the expected destination before attempting to retrieve its contents.","

20,CWE-918,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `func.substr` function in the `charlist` query. This function allows an attacker to specify a URL or other resource to be retrieved by the server, which can be used to bypass access controls and retrieve sensitive information.

For example, an attacker could send a request with a URL that points to a local resource, such as a file on the server's file system, and the server would retrieve the contents of that file. This could allow an attacker to access sensitive information, such as configuration files or other sensitive data, that is not intended to be accessible to the public.

Additionally, the `func.upper` function used in the `charlist` query could also be used to bypass access controls and retrieve sensitive information.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the `func.substr` function is only used with trusted sources, and that the `func.upper` function is not used in a way that could be used to bypass access controls.","

The `text` function allows the user to specify a string that is used as a column name in the query. However, the user can specify any string, including a URL, which can be used to make a request to a different host or port.

For example, if the user specifies a URL such as `http://example.com`, the server will make a request to `http://example.com` and retrieve the contents of the URL. This can be used to bypass access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly.

Additionally, the `text` function can be used to specify other URLs such as `file://` or `gopher://` which can provide greater control over the contents of the request.

Therefore, the given code is vulnerable to SSRF attack, and it is recommended to use a safer method to specify the column name in the `group_by` clause, such as using a parameterized query or a whitelist of allowed column names.","

The vulnerability is due to the fact that the server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `calibre_db.common_filters()` function, which allows an attacker to specify a URL that the server will retrieve and return as part of the response. This URL can be any URL that the server has access to, including internal network URLs or other URLs that can access documents on the system (using file://).

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted URL that the server will retrieve and return as part of the response. This can allow the attacker to access internal network resources or other sensitive information that the server is not intended to access.

To fix this vulnerability, the server should ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination by validating the URL and ensuring that it is a valid URL that the server is intended to access. This can be done by checking the URL against a list of valid URLs or by using a whitelist of allowed URLs.","

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the code retrieves the contents of a URL provided by the user, without properly validating the URL. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a URL that points to a host or port that is not intended to be accessed by the server, potentially bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly.

For example, an attacker could provide a URL that points to a host or port that is not accessible from the server's network, or a URL that points to a host or port that is not intended to be accessed by the server. The server would then attempt to retrieve the contents of the URL, potentially resulting in the retrieval of sensitive information or the execution of malicious code.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly validate the URL provided by the user, and ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed hosts or ports, or by using a more robust validation mechanism such as a regular expression.","

55,CWE-918,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `calibre_db.common_filters()` function, which allows an attacker to specify a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieve the contents of this URL. This can be used to bypass access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly.

For example, an attacker could send a request to the server with a URL that points to a host or port that is not expected, such as a host on the internal network or a port that is not open to the public. The server will then retrieve the contents of this URL, potentially allowing the attacker to access sensitive information or perform other malicious actions.

To fix this vulnerability, the `calibre_db.common_filters()` function should be modified to ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination. This can be done by checking the URL or similar request against a list of expected hosts or ports, or by using other security mechanisms such as IP filtering or user authentication.","

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the code retrieves the contents of a URL provided by the user, without verifying that the URL is valid or that it is being sent to the expected destination. This allows an attacker to send a request to any URL they want, potentially bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly.

For example, an attacker could send a request to a URL that is not intended to be accessed by the server, such as a URL on a different host or a URL that is not accessible over the network. The server would then retrieve the contents of this URL, potentially exposing sensitive information or causing the server to perform malicious actions.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should verify that the URL is valid and that it is being sent to the expected destination before retrieving its contents. This can be done by checking the URL against a list of valid URLs or by verifying that the URL is accessible over the network. Additionally, the code should ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination by checking the request headers or by using a secure connection.","

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

CWE description:
The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Extended description:

            Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:
            
               Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)
               Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and
               Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)
            
            When any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.
            There are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:
               
                  Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.
                  Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.

The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

In versions lower than 0.65.2, FastAPI would try to read the request payload as JSON even if the content-type header sent was not set to application/json or a compatible JSON media type (e.g. application/geo+json).

The vulnerability is caused by the use of `json.loads()` to parse the `allowlist` JSON data, which can lead to a JSON deserialization vulnerability if the input data is not properly validated. An attacker can potentially exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious `allowlist` JSON data that contains a specially crafted regular expression that can be used to bypass the validation check.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malicious `allowlist` JSON data that contains a specially crafted regular expression that can be used to bypass the validation check. For example, an attacker can send a `allowlist` JSON data that contains a regular expression that matches any string, such as `"".*""` or `""^.*$""`. This can allow the attacker to bypass the validation check and execute arbitrary code on the verifier and registrar.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly validate the `allowlist` JSON data before using it to deserialize the data. This can be done by using a JSON schema validator or by implementing a custom validation function that checks the format of the regular expressions in the `allowlist` data.","

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

[{'lang': 'en', 'value': ""Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform built as a web application All users of Nautobot versions earlier than 1.6.6 or 2.0.5 are potentially affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability. Due to incorrect usage of Django's `mark_safe()` API when rendering certain types of user-authored content; including custom links, job buttons, and computed fields; it is possible that users with permission to create or edit these types of content could craft a malicious payload (such as JavaScript code) that would be executed when rendering pages containing this content. The maintainers have fixed the incorrect uses of `mark_safe()` (generally by replacing them with appropriate use of `format_html()` instead) to prevent such malicious data from being executed. Users on Nautobot 1.6.x LTM should upgrade to v1.6.6 and users on Nautobot 2.0.x should upgrade to v2.0.5. Appropriate object permissions can and should be applied to restrict which users are permitted to create or edit the aforementioned types of user-authored content. Other than that, there is no direct workaround available.""}]

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

96,CWE-918,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the code retrieves the contents of a URL provided by the user, without properly validating the URL or ensuring that it is being sent to the expected destination. This allows an attacker to send a request to a URL that is not intended to be accessed by the server, potentially bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly.

For example, an attacker could provide a URL that points to a different host or port, and the server would retrieve the contents of that URL, potentially exposing sensitive information or causing other issues.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly validate the URL and ensure that it is being sent to the expected destination. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed URLs, or by using a library that provides URL validation and filtering. Additionally, the code should not use the `filter` method to validate the URL, as this can be bypassed by using a malicious URL that contains a filter that is not intended to be used. Instead, the code should use a library that provides URL validation and filtering, such as the `urllib` library in Python.","
