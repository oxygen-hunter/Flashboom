The vulnerability is due to the use of the `filter` method in the `adv_search_extension` function. The `filter` method takes a predicate function as an argument, which is applied to each element in the sequence. In this case, the predicate function is `db.Books.data.any(db.Data.format == extension)`.

The problem is that the `any` method is not properly sanitizing the input `extension` before using it in the predicate function. An attacker can potentially provide a malicious value for `extension` that could lead to a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack.

For example, an attacker could provide a value for `extension` that is a URL that points to a malicious server, and the `any` method would return `True` if the server responds with a valid response. This could allow the attacker to access resources on the server that the user should not have access to.

To fix this vulnerability, the `adv_search_extension` function should properly sanitize the input `extension` before using it in the predicate function. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed values for `extension`, or by using a more robust sanitization method such as input validation.","

If the input string is a URL, the `len` function will return the length of the URL, which can be used to bypass access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly.

For example, if the input string is ""http://example.com"", the `len` function will return 22, which can be used to bypass the firewall that blocks access to the URL.

Therefore, the `makeStringSorted` function is vulnerable to SSRF attack, and the entire code is vulnerable to SSRF attack.","

16,CWE-918,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

The vulnerability is caused by the `makeStringSorted` function, which takes a string as input and returns a sorted version of the string. The function uses the `ord` function to convert each character in the string to its ASCII code, and then uses the `inverse` function to calculate the number of permutations of the string.

The `inverse` function is vulnerable to SSRF attack because it uses the `len` function to calculate the number of permutations of the string. If the input string is a URL, the `len` function will return the length of the URL, which can be used to bypass the access controls of the server.

For example, if the input string is ""http://example.com"", the `len` function will return 22, which is the length of the URL. This means that the `inverse` function will return a value that is not the true number of permutations of the string, which can be used to bypass the access controls of the server.

Therefore, the `makeStringSorted` function is vulnerable to SSRF attack, and it is recommended to fix the vulnerability by using a different approach to calculate the number of permutations of the string.","

The vulnerability is due to the fact that the `inverse` function uses a lazy initialization, which means that it only initializes the array when it is first needed. This allows an attacker to determine the contents of the string by timing the execution of the function.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted string to the `makeStringSorted` function, which would cause the `inverse` function to be initialized and the contents of the string to be determined.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `makeStringSorted` function should be replaced with a built-in sorting function, such as `sorted`, to ensure that the sorting order is determined in a constant amount of time regardless of the input.","

The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

By providing URLs to unexpected hosts or ports, attackers can make it appear that the server is sending the request, possibly bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly. The server can be used as a proxy to conduct port scanning of hosts in internal networks, use other URLs such as that can access documents on the system (using file://), or use other protocols such as gopher:// or tftp://, which may provide greater control over the contents of requests.
         
",1.0,982.0,6.0,2.448237419128418
48,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code is using the `makeStringSorted` function to sort a string, but it is not using the `sorted` function or any other built-in sorting function. Instead, it is using a custom implementation of a sorting algorithm, which is vulnerable to a timing attack.

The `makeStringSorted` function is using a combination of the number of occurrences of each character in the string and the length of the string to determine the sorting order. This means that the function is vulnerable to a timing attack, as the time it takes to execute the function can be used to determine the sorting order.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a string with a specific pattern, such as a string with a large number of occurrences of a specific character, and measuring the time it takes to execute the `makeStringSorted` function. By doing so, the attacker can determine the sorting order of the string, which can be used to bypass access controls or other security mechanisms.

Therefore, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-918, and it is recommended to use a built-in sorting function or a secure sorting algorithm to prevent this vulnerability.","

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The `&` operator is used to perform a bitwise AND operation on the two operands, which in this case are the `role` column and the `constants.ROLE_ADMIN` constant.

The `constants.ROLE_ADMIN` constant is a bitmask that represents the admin role, which is a power level of 1. The `op('&')` operator is used to check if the `role` column of the `User` table has the admin role set, which means that the user has the admin role.

The code then checks if the user has the admin role by checking if the result of the bitwise AND operation is equal to the `constants.ROLE_ADMIN` constant. If the user has the admin role, the code will proceed to delete the user.

This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.

80,CWE-601,"  YES, the code is vulnerable to CWE-601.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `redirect` function in the `return` statement, which takes the user-controlled input from the `request.POST.get('next', topic.get_absolute_url())` method. This input is used to construct a URL that is then redirected to by the `redirect` function.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request that contains a malicious URL in the `next` parameter. The malicious URL could be a phishing site that looks legitimate, or it could be a site that is designed to steal user credentials.

The `redirect` function does not validate the URL that is passed to it, so it will redirect the user to the malicious site without any warning. This could lead to a phishing attack or a site that steals user credentials.

To fix this vulnerability, the `redirect` function should be used with caution and should validate the URL that is passed to it. Additionally, the `get_absolute_url` method should be used with caution and should be validated to ensure that it returns a valid URL.","

The vulnerability is in the `authenticate` function, which accepts a dictionary `auth` as input. The function then extracts the `username` and `password` from the `auth` dictionary and uses them to authenticate the user. However, the function does not properly validate the `username` and `password` before using them for authentication.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted `auth` dictionary that contains a malicious `username` and `password`. For example, the attacker could send a `username` that is not a valid user name, but is a valid dictionary key. The `username` could be used to bypass the authentication check and allow the attacker to access the system.

To fix this vulnerability, the `authenticate` function should properly validate the `username` and `password` before using them for authentication. This can be done by checking if the `username` and `password` are valid and if the user is enabled before using them for authentication.","

CWE description:
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

This could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system or cause other types of harm.

To fix this vulnerability, the `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile` function should be modified to properly sanitize the input string before passing it to the `exec` function.

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.
