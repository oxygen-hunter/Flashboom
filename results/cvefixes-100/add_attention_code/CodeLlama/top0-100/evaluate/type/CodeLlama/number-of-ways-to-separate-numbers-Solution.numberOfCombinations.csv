The vulnerability is caused by the use of `func.random()` in the query to retrieve the random books. This allows an attacker to make it appear that the server is sending the request, possibly bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly. The server can be used as a proxy to conduct port scanning of hosts in internal networks, use other URLs such as that can access documents on the system (using file://), or use other protocols such as gopher:// or tftp://, which may provide greater control over the contents of requests.

This is because the `func.random()` function is not properly validated, and an attacker can provide a malicious value that can cause the server to retrieve data from unexpected sources. For example, an attacker could provide a value that is not a valid URL, but instead a command that the server should execute. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to a security breach.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly validate the input and ensure that it is a valid URL before using it in the query. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed URLs, or by using a library that can validate the input and ensure that it is a valid URL.","

The reason is that the code performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check. This allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.

In the given code, the `numberOfCombinations` function takes a string `num` as input and returns the number of combinations of numbers that can be formed using the digits in `num`. However, the function does not correctly perform the authorization check, which allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and perform unauthorized actions.

For example, an attacker could pass a string `num` that contains a large number of digits, which would cause the function to perform a large number of calculations and return a large number as the result. This would allow the attacker to perform unauthorized actions, such as accessing sensitive data or performing unauthorized transactions.

To fix this vulnerability, the function should correctly perform the authorization check and only allow authorized actors to perform the action. This can be done by adding additional checks to ensure that the input string `num` is valid and that the actor has the necessary permissions to perform the action.","

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `del` statement to delete elements from a dictionary. The `del` statement does not check if the key being deleted is a valid key in the dictionary, and it simply deletes the key-value pair without checking if the key is valid.

In the given code, the `del` statement is used to delete the key-value pair from the dictionary `self.dict` if the key is in the dictionary. However, if the key is not in the dictionary, the `del` statement will still delete the key-value pair, which is not what we want.

To fix this vulnerability, we should use the `pop` method to delete the key-value pair from the dictionary instead of using the `del` statement. The `pop` method checks if the key is in the dictionary before deleting it, so it will not delete a key that is not in the dictionary.

def filter(self, names):

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `replace` function does not properly handle the `unicode` type. Specifically, the function does not check if the `value` parameter is a `unicode` object before converting it to a `str` object. This means that if the `value` parameter is a `unicode` object, it will be converted to a `str` object using the default encoding, which may result in a loss of information.

For example, if the `value` parameter is a `unicode` object containing the character 'é', it will be converted to a `str` object using the default encoding, which may result in the loss of the accent. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the program, as the program may not be able to handle the accent correctly.

To fix the vulnerability, the `replace` function should check if the `value` parameter is a `unicode` object before converting it to a `str` object. This can be done by using the `isinstance` function to check if the `value` parameter is a `unicode` object. If the `value` parameter is a `unicode` object, it should be converted to a `str` object using the `encode` method, passing in the desired encoding.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

Extended description:

            Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:

This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.

CWE description:
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `smuggle_url` function, which allows an attacker to add arbitrary HTTP headers to the request made by the `yt-dlp` tool. This can allow the attacker to manipulate the request in a way that the tool does not expect, potentially leading to cookie exfiltration.

The `smuggle_url` function is used to add a `Referer` header to the request, which is used to identify the source of the request. However, the function does not properly validate the input, allowing an attacker to add a malicious `Referer` header that can be used to manipulate the request.

For example, an attacker could add a `Referer` header that is not the actual source of the request, but rather a malicious URL that the tool will interpret as the source of the request. This can allow the attacker to manipulate the request in a way that the tool does not expect, potentially leading to cookie exfiltration.

To fix this vulnerability, the `smuggle_url` function should properly validate the input and ensure that the `Referer` header is not modified by the attacker. Additionally, the tool should be updated to properly handle malicious `Referer` headers and prevent cookie exfiltr","

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918, as it is not using the `filter` method to retrieve the first element that matches the filter, but rather using the `filter` method to filter the results based on the `db_filter` variable.","

[{'lang': 'en', 'value': 'Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in GitHub repository janeczku/calibre-web prior to 0.6.18.'}]

CWE description:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

Extended description:
By providing URLs to unexpected hosts or ports, attackers can make it appear that the server is sending the request, possibly bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly. The server can be used as a proxy to conduct port scanning of hosts in internal networks, use other URLs such as that can access documents on the system (using file://), or use other protocols such as gopher:// or tftp://, which may provide greater control over the contents of requests.

100,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code is using the `os.path.join()` function to combine the `author_dir` and `title_dir` variables, which are both user-supplied strings. However, the code is not using the `os.path.join()` function in a way that could allow an attacker to bypass access controls.

The `os.path.join()` function is used to combine two or more path components into a single path, using the appropriate separator character for the platform. The function does not allow an attacker to bypass access controls, as it only combines the path components based on the platform-specific separator character.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.","
