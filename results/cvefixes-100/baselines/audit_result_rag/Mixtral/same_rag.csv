This is a classic example of a lack of proper input validation and authorization checks, which falls under the CWE-863 category.",872,91,3.6066713333129883
66,CWE-203," Based on the given code and the description of CWE-203, I would say 'NO'. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to timing attacks or any other form of side-channel attacks as described in the CWE description. The code only creates a default GatewayResponse object when none is provided, and it does not depend on any external input or state to determine the behavior of the function. Therefore, there is no observable discrepancy or variation in the function's behavior that could reveal security-sensitive information to an attacker.",1185,116,4.679435968399048
67,CWE-203," Based on the given information, it is not clear if the provided Python code is vulnerable to CWE-203. The code snippet does not show any observable discrepancies or variations in response based on unauthorized input or state. However, without additional context or information about the larger system and implementation, it is impossible to make a definitive conclusion. Therefore, my answer is 'NO'. However, it is always important to keep in mind that security vulnerabilities can be complex and multifaceted, and this assessment is based only on the provided code snippet.",1427,119,4.755401134490967
68,CWE-601," Based on the given code snippet, it is not directly related to the described vulnerability in CVE-2021-21273 and CWE-601. The code snippet does not involve accepting a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site and using that link in a Redirect. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",652,81,3.153651237487793
69,CWE-93," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-93 as it does not handle CRLF sequences in a special way. The code only converts values to strings if they are not unicode, which is not related to CRLF attacks.",380,57,2.2126059532165527
70,CWE-93," NO. The given code does not involve handling of user input or any input from external sources. It only converts strings to title case and replaces underscores with hyphens. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-93 or any other type of injection attack.",338,58,2.3134825229644775
71,CWE-93," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-93 as it does not involve handling of CRLF sequences. The code only appends values to a list in a dictionary, and converts non-unicode values to strings if necessary.",384,56,2.1887755393981934
72,CWE-93, NO. The given code does not involve handling of CRLF sequences or any special treatment of newline characters. It only checks if a name is in the dictionary and deletes it if it is.,384,42,1.6617217063903809
73,CWE-93," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-93 as it does not involve handling of CRLF sequences. The code only checks if the value is a unicode object and converts it to a string if not, it does not involve any input from external sources or special characters like CRLF.",376,69,2.693892478942871
74,CWE-79," YES, the code is vulnerable to CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting). The issue lies in the fact that the code does not properly sanitize the user input (bad_url and good_url) before constructing the URLs. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the URLs, which can then be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the page. The code does not check the scheme of the URLs, allowing schemes other than HTTP or HTTPS to bypass the security check.",2314,113,4.632648944854736
75,CWE-918," Based on the given code and the description of CVE-2022-0339 and CWE-918, I would say 'NO'. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve retrieving external URLs or making external requests. Instead, it only deletes local data based on the user ID provided.",1731,85,3.5296437740325928
76,CWE-284," YES, the code is vulnerable to CWE-284 because it does not properly restrict access to deleting a user. The code checks if there is an admin user other than the one being deleted, but it does not check if the caller of the function is an admin user. This means that any user can call the function and delete other users, as long as there is at least one admin user left in the system.",1873,89,3.6477701663970947
77,CWE-918," Yes, it is vulnerable. The code is making a request to a URL provided by an untrusted source (recipe.link), and it is modifying the URL before making the request. An attacker could provide a malicious URL that the code will make a request to, potentially allowing the attacker to access internal resources or bypass access controls.",572,74,5.658174753189087
78,CWE-116," Yes, it is vulnerable. The issue is that the `plugin_names` argument is concatenated with the command string using the `join()` method without proper escaping. This could allow an attacker to inject shell commands by providing specially crafted plugin names containing shell metacharacters. For example, an attacker could provide a plugin name like `""; rm -rf / --sh` which would be executed as a shell command when the command is constructed. To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should properly escape the plugin names before joining them with the command string. One way to do this is by using a quoting mechanism such as shell quoting or Python's `shlex.quote()` function.",1291,151,5.899629354476929
79,CWE-918, NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not involve handling or validating user-supplied URLs.,805,35,1.450490951538086

82,CWE-78," YES, this code is vulnerable to OS command injection due to the use of `exec(code, globals())`, which executes the retrieved code as a part of the current Python process, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands.",865,54,2.1609392166137695
83,CWE-22," YES, this code is vulnerable to CWE-22 (Path Traversal). The `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile` function may allow an attacker to provide a malicious file path, which could result in the execution of arbitrary code outside of the intended restricted directory. The use of `exec` to execute the retrieved code without proper sanitization further exacerbates the risk.",497,87,3.3996715545654297
84,CWE-352," Yes, it is vulnerable. The code is trying to parse the request body as JSON even when the content-type header is not set to application/json or another JSON compatible media type. This can allow an attacker to send a request with a content-type of text/plain containing JSON data, which will be accepted and parsed by the FastAPI application, potentially leading to unintended code execution or data exposure.",1170,86,3.424549102783203
85,CWE-290," Based on the given code, the answer is 'NO'. The code does not directly handle user input or untrusted data, and it only validates the 'exclude' list's format using a separate function 'config.valid_exclude_list()'. Therefore, it does not meet the conditions for CWE-290 vulnerability.",530,74,2.8652231693267822
86,CWE-835," Yes, it is vulnerable. The while loop condition is `while self._buffer:` which will never be false as long as there is data in `self._buffer`. If an attacker can send malformed data that causes an infinite exception in the try block, the while loop will continue indefinitely, consuming excessive resources.",750,68,2.6813504695892334
87,CWE-444," Yes, the code is vulnerable. The issue is that the `smuggle_url` function call allows for the passing of arbitrary `http_headers` in the request, which can be used by an attacker to smuggle malicious headers to the ultimate destination (in this case, the Vimeo server). This can potentially lead to unintended actions on the server, such as cookie exfiltration or unauthorized access. The use of the `smuggle_url` function with the ability to pass `http_headers` is the cause of the inconsistent parsing and interpretation of messages, making the code vulnerable to CWE-444.",1527,140,5.564405918121338
88,CWE-79," YES, The code is vulnerable to Reflected XSS attacks due to the unescaped user-controllable input (reason) being included in the error message without proper escaping before being returned to the user in the HTTP response.

91,CWE-918," Yes, the code is vulnerable. The `send_file` function is likely receiving a user-controlled filename, which is being used to construct the file path without any validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially provide a malicious filename containing a malicious URL or protocol, which would be sent to the server as part of the file path. This could lead to server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks, as described in the CVE and CWE descriptions provided.",540,102,3.9400858879089355

95,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the use of `mark_safe()` or similar functions to render user-controllable input directly in HTML without proper escaping. The `rendered_value` variable may contain user-supplied data that could include malicious scripts, which would be executed in the victim's browser when the page is rendered. To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should use functions like `format_html()` or `escapejs()` to properly escape user-supplied data before rendering it in HTML.",2175,125,5.178215265274048
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or constructing URLs from user input.
