Answer: YES

Reason: The `_delete_user` function is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The function deletes various records from the database based on the user ID provided as an argument. An attacker can manipulate the user ID argument to delete records from the database that they should not have access to. Additionally, the function does not check the source of the request, allowing an attacker to potentially make the function delete records from arbitrary URLs, bypassing access controls such as firewalls. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as data leakage or data modification.",1837,218,8.545418977737427
76,CWE-284," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper access control checks. The code deletes a user and all associated data if the following conditions are met:

1. An admin user exists in the system.
2. The user to be deleted is not the 'Guest' user.

However, there is no check to ensure that the user making the call to the `_delete_user` function is an admin user. This means that any user can call this function and delete other users, including admin users, if there is no admin user present in the system.

Therefore, the code violates the principle of least privilege, as any user can delete other users, which is beyond their authorized scope. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as data loss or unauthorized access to resources.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should be modified to ensure that only authorized users, such as admin users, can call the `_delete_user` function. This can be achieved by adding an access control check at the beginning of the function, for example, by checking the role of the user making the call.",1979,247,9.798153162002563
77,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or CWE-918.

95,CWE-79," The given code for the function `test_custom_field_table_render` is not directly related to the `stoneGameVIII` function, so I cannot evaluate its vulnerability based on that code alone. However, I will evaluate the `test_custom_field_table_render` function based on the information provided in the context of the CVE-2023-48705 and CWE-79 description.

Based on the provided context, the `test_custom_field_table_render` function appears to be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the use of Django's `mark_safe()` API in an incorrect manner when rendering certain types of user-authored content, such as custom links, job buttons, and computed fields. The code snippet provided does not show the usage of `mark_safe()` directly, but the description indicates that it is used inappropriately in the larger context of the Nautobot application.

Therefore, the answer is 'YES', and the vulnerability is due to the incorrect usage of Django's `mark_safe()` API when rendering user-controllable input.",2280,258,10.01029920578003
