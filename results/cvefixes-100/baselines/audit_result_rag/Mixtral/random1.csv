85,CWE-290," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-290 as it is not handling user input in an unsanitized manner. Instead, it is validating JSON data and calling a function `config.valid_exclude_list()` to validate regular expressions.",692,62,2.485908269882202
86,CWE-835," The given code for the function `data_received` is not vulnerable to an infinite loop as described in CWE-835. The loop in the code exits when `self._buffer` is empty, which is a condition that can be reached.

However, it's important to note that the code snippet provided does not include the `Buffer` and `header_from_binary` functions, which could potentially contain vulnerabilities. The vulnerability described in the CVE and CWE is related to those functions, not the `data_received` function itself.

The second function `diffWaysToComputeRecu` is not related to the vulnerability described in the question, so it does not need to be evaluated for vulnerability.",903,161,6.225717306137085
87,CWE-444," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The issue is that the'smuggle\_url' function call allows for the passing of arbitrary 'http\_headers' to be included in the HTTP request to Vimeo's server. This could potentially allow an attacker to perform HTTP header injection attacks, such as setting a Referer header to a malicious URL, or setting a Cookie header to steal session information. This vulnerability falls under the CWE-444 category, as described in the provided CVE and CWE descriptions.",1687,113,4.5507683753967285
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter used in constructing the error_params string.
