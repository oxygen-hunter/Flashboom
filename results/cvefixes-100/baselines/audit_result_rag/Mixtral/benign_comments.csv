86,CWE-835," NO. The given code does not contain an infinite loop, as the loop condition ""while self._buffer:"" will eventually be false when self._buffer is empty.",772,34,1.4326279163360596
87,CWE-444, NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-444 as it does not act as an intermediary HTTP agent and does not pass arbitrary headers to external APIs without proper validation.,1549,45,1.9497981071472168
88,CWE-79," NO. The code does not directly output user-controllable data without proper escaping. Instead, it uses the Django `urlencode` and `reverse` functions to encode and generate URLs, respectively, which should handle escaping automatically. Additionally, the error message is raised as a `Problem` object with a link, which is also not directly output to the user without proper escaping.",1819,84,3.436532497406006
89,CWE-22," Based on the given code, my answer is: NO.

The reason is that the code uses the `os.path.join()` function to construct the file path, which properly combines the directory and filename components without allowing any special path traversal characters to be included. The `settings.backup.folder` variable is assumed to be a restricted directory, so there is no vulnerability present in this code.",567,87,3.43415904045105
90,CWE-22," NO. In this code, the filename is being constructed using the `os.path.join()` function, which properly joins the path components without allowing for path traversal attacks. The `settings.backup.folder` is assumed to be a restricted directory, so there is no vulnerability present.",560,63,2.4745254516601562
91,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not receive a URL or similar request from an upstream component and does not retrieve the contents of this URL without sufficient validation. Instead, it constructs a local file path using a given filename and then sends the file from that local path using the send_file function.",561,61,2.3906662464141846
92,CWE-22," NO. In this code, the `os.path.join()` function is used to construct a file path, and it does not contain any user-controlled input. Therefore, there is no risk of path traversal attacks.",613,49,1.953437089920044
93,CWE-22," NO. In the given code, the filename is being constructed using the `os.path.join()` method, which properly combines the components of the pathname without allowing any special characters or relative path traversal. The resulting path is then used to serve a file from a static directory, which is not vulnerable to arbitrary file reading or path traversal attacks.",606,75,2.938491106033325
94,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not receive a URL or similar request from an upstream component and does not retrieve the contents of this URL without sufficient validation. Instead, it constructs a local file path based on hardcoded directories and returns the file using Flask's send_file function.",607,62,2.45589280128479
95,CWE-79," NO.

The code does not involve user-controllable input being placed directly into output that is used as a web page served to other users. Instead, it is checking the expected values of columns against the actual values, which is not a cross-site scripting vulnerability.",2197,60,2.6136789321899414
96,CWE-918," NO.

The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or any other type of vulnerability described in the provided CVE or CWE descriptions. The code only performs database queries and operations, and does not involve making external HTTP requests or handling user-supplied URLs.",1216,69,2.8172669410705566

98,CWE-918," NO.

The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or CWE-918, as it does not retrieve the contents of a URL or similar request from an upstream component without sufficient checks.
