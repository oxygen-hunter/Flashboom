80,CWE-601," NO. The given code does not contain any open redirect vulnerability as it is not using user-controlled input to redirect to an external site. Instead, it is only redirecting to the next page or the topic's absolute URL.",866,50,2.0754640102386475
81,CWE-264," Yes, it is vulnerable to the same CWE-264 issue as the previous code. The main issue is that the code does not properly check the expiration of the tokens being used, allowing remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by creating new tokens through token chaining. Additionally, the code does not properly handle the case where a user's account is disabled or has a changed password, allowing unauthorized access in those cases as well.",3142,97,4.234150648117065
82,CWE-78," YES, this code is vulnerable to OS command injection (CWE-78). The `exec` function executes the given code as if it were part of the current Python script, which can include arbitrary OS commands if the input is not properly sanitized. In this case, the code is being loaded from an untrusted source (`config.retrieveBoilerplateFile(doc, ""bs-extensions"")`), so an attacker could potentially inject and execute OS commands.",868,104,4.0705389976501465
83,CWE-22," Yes, it is vulnerable. The `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile` function call may allow an attacker to provide a malicious file with a relative or absolute path that can be executed through the `exec` function, leading to arbitrary code execution and potential file disclosure.",500,60,2.4241340160369873
84,CWE-352," NO. The code is testing for an expected error response when sending an invalid JSON payload, and is intentionally causing a JSON parsing error by patching the json.loads function. It is not vulnerable to a CSRF attack as it is not handling user input or checking the content-type header.",1173,63,2.565870523452759
85,CWE-290," Based on the given code, the function `benign_validate_agent_data` is not vulnerable to CWE-290 as it does not implement any authentication scheme and does not process any user-supplied data in a way that could lead to spoofing attacks. The function only validates the JSON structure of the `agent_data` and checks the validity of regular expressions in the `exclude` list.",533,90,3.506072521209717
86,CWE-835," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The reason is that the while loop condition `while self._buffer:` does not change during the loop execution, which can lead to an infinite loop if an attacker sends malformed data that causes the buffer to never be empty. This can result in excessive memory consumption.",753,63,2.5371851921081543
87,CWE-444," Yes, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-444 (HTTP Message Smuggling) because it passes the 'http_headers' dictionary directly to the'smuggle_url' function without validating or interpreting the headers. This allows an attacker to smuggle malicious headers, such as 'Transfer-encoding' or 'Content-length', which can lead to inconsistent parsing and interpretation of messages between the intermediary (the code) and the ultimate destination (the Vimeo server).",1529,111,4.459947824478149
88,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding on the ""reason"" parameter. The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code in the ""reason"" parameter, which will be reflected back in the error message and executed in the victim's browser.",1799,64,2.7023696899414062
89,CWE-22," Yes, it is vulnerable. The code constructs a file path using a user-controlled filename variable without proper validation, which can allow an attacker to traverse outside of the restricted settings.backup.folder directory and access arbitrary files on the system.",549,53,2.112046003341675
90,CWE-22," Yes, it is vulnerable. The code constructs a file path using an external input (filename) without proper validation, which can allow an attacker to traverse outside of the restricted directory (settings.backup.folder) and access arbitrary files on the system.",542,54,2.122690439224243
91,CWE-918," Yes, it is vulnerable. The code takes a user-controlled filename as an argument and passes it directly to the send_file function without any validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially provide a filename containing a malicious URL or protocol, leading to server-side request forgery (SSRF) or other attacks.",543,69,2.7027528285980225
92,CWE-22," Yes, it is vulnerable. The code constructs a file path using user-controlled input (filename) and does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname, allowing an attacker to potentially access files or directories outside of the intended restricted directory.",595,54,2.1634511947631836
93,CWE-22," Yes, it is vulnerable. The code constructs a file path using user-controlled input (filename) without proper validation, allowing an attacker to potentially traverse outside of the intended directory and read arbitrary files on the system. This is an example of CWE-22: Path Traversal.",588,64,2.5603604316711426
94,CWE-918," Yes, it is vulnerable. The code constructs a file path using user-controlled input (filename) without sufficient validation or sanitization, which can lead to SSRF attacks if an attacker provides a malicious URL.",589,49,2.0598838329315186
95,CWE-79," Yes, the code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the use of `mark_safe()` or similar functions to render user-controllable input directly in HTML without proper escaping. The `rendered_value` variable may contain user-supplied data that could include malicious scripts, which would be executed in the victim's browser when the page is rendered. To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should use functions like `format_html()` or `escapejs()` to properly escape user-supplied data before rendering it in HTML.",2178,125,5.061566352844238
96,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or constructing URLs from user input. Instead, it only queries the local database and creates new objects based on the input.",1198,58,2.3955490589141846
97,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or constructing URLs from user input. Instead, it only queries the local database and creates new objects based on the input.",1198,58,2.3789687156677246
98,CWE-918," Yes, it is vulnerable. The code retrieves user-supplied input (book\_format\_from and book\_format\_to) and uses it to construct a URL for the helper.convert\_book\_format function call. This function call appears to be making an external request, potentially allowing an attacker to supply a malicious URL as the argument, leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.",1066,89,3.5593507289886475
99,CWE-918," Yes, it is vulnerable. The code retrieves user-supplied input (book\_format\_from and book\_format\_to) and uses it to construct a URL for the helper.convert\_book\_format function call.

100,CWE-918," NO. The given code does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks as it does not involve making external HTTP requests or constructing URLs from user input. Instead, it only deals with local file system operations and database manipulations.",1594,57,2.4217498302459717
