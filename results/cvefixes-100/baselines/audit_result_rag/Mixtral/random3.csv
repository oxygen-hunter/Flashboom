1,CWE-918," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation on the `url` parameter, which can potentially allow an attacker to perform Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks by providing malicious URLs. This can lead to unintended network traffic, bypassing access controls, and potentially executing arbitrary code. The `is_private_address` check is not sufficient to prevent SSRF attacks as it only checks for private IP addresses and does not validate the given URL's scheme, hostname, or port number.",1576,120,4.769387722015381

76,CWE-284," Yes, the given Python code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper access control checks. The code deletes a user and all associated data if the following condition is met:

1. The query returns at least one user with the role of 'ADMIN'.
2. The user to be deleted is not 'Guest'.

However, there is no check to ensure that the user making the call to this function has the 'ADMIN' role. This means that any user can call this function and delete any other user, including the 'ADMIN' user, if there is no 'ADMIN' user present in the system. This is a clear violation of the principle of least privilege and can lead to unintended consequences.",2004,158,6.325541257858276
77,CWE-918," The given Python code is not directly related to the provided vulnerable code.
