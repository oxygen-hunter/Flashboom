This vulnerability is typically caused by the incorrect handling of CRLF characters in user-supplied input, leading to HTTP response splitting or similar attacks.

Moreover, the `subarraySum` method you provided does not handle user input or CRLF characters at all.

The function only checks if the user is not the ""Guest"" user, but it does not verify if the user has the ""admin"" role or any other role with the required permissions to delete a user. This could allow any user to delete other users if they can call this function, leading to an improper access control vulnerability.
