10,CWE-918," NO.

The given function `benign_adv_search_serie` does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CWE-918 vulnerability type. This is because the function is only filtering queries based on `include_series_inputs` and `exclude_series_inputs` which are likely intended to be internal IDs of series rather than external URLs.

Therefore, the function does not seem to be receiving or sending any requests to external hosts or ports, and it does not use the provided inputs to construct URLs or access any internal resources.

However, it is important to note that the vulnerability of a code snippet depends on the context in which it is used.

The reason is that the `benign_toggle_archived` function does not contain any code that makes a request to an external URL or processes user-supplied input in a way that could lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). It only calls the functions `change_archived_books` and `remove_synced_book` with the `book_id` as input, which are not defined in the provided code.

The function `benign_send_transaction` is not vulnerable to CWE-863 because it simply calls another function `send_transactions` with the provided arguments. The vulnerability in the `send_transaction` function is related to the OpenZeppelin Contracts for Cairo library and not directly caused by the function itself. In the provided `benign_send_transaction` function, there is no authorization check being performed, but the function does not perform any sensitive operations either.

The `benign_send_transactions` function appears to be similar to the vulnerable function `send_transactions`, but with a key difference: it does not call the `sign_transaction` method with the `account.contract_address` as the first argument. Instead, it uses the `account.contract_address` as the first argument in the `sign_transaction` method in the vulnerable function, which is likely not intended.

Assuming that the `sign_transaction` method is used for signing transactions and the `account.contract_address` is not meant to be used as part of the signature, the `benign_send_transactions` function should not be vulnerable to the same authorization bypass vulnerability as the `send_transactions` function.

However, it is still important to ensure that the `benign_send_transactions` function is only called with properly authorized accounts and that the `sign_transaction` method is used securely.",875,211,19.16128396987915

YES, the provided code is vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) with the same CWE-918 vulnerability as the original code. The vulnerability exists because the code retrieves the content of a URL provided in the recipe.link attribute without sufficiently validating that the URL points to a trusted resource. An attacker can exploit this by providing a localhost URL or an internal URL, allowing them to access/read the internal file system to access sensitive information.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should validate the URL to ensure it points to a trusted source before making the request. Additionally, you can restrict the allowed schemes to only 'http' and 'https' to prevent other protocols from being used.",575,159,14.535204887390137

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to sanitize the `filename` variable by ensuring it does not contain any special characters or sequences that could be used for path traversal.
