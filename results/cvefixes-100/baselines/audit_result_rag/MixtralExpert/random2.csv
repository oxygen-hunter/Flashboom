62,CWE-918," NO.

The code you provided for `toggle_archived` function is not vulnerable to CWE-918 as it does not make any outbound network requests based on user input. The vulnerability in the first code snippet was due to the `change_archived_books` function making an outbound network request using user-provided input (`book_id`) without proper validation, which could lead to SSRF. However, the second code snippet does not contain any such functionality.

The `stoneGameVIII` function is also not vulnerable as it does not make any outbound network requests or use user-provided input in a way that could lead to CWE-918.

However, the `stoneGameVIII` function is not related to the previous `send_transaction` function and needs to be evaluated separately. Based on the provided code, the `stoneGameVIII` function does not contain any authorization checks either, so it is not vulnerable to CWE-863.

76,CWE-284," Yes, the code is vulnerable according to CWE-284: Incorrect Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'). The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation which could allow an attacker to manipulate the 'content' parameter to gain unauthorized access to delete users other than 'Guest'. The code only checks if the user's name is 'Guest' before deleting, but it does not verify if the user has the correct permissions to delete other users. Additionally, the code does not check if the 'content' parameter refers to the currently logged-in user or an admin user, allowing for potential privilege escalation attacks.

The function `get_file` is vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CWE-918, because it makes an HTTP request to the URL contained in `recipe.link` without properly validating it. This can allow an attacker to craft a malicious URL that can lead to information disclosure, port scanning, or other potential attacks.

On the other hand, the `stoneGameVIII` function is not related to network requests or URLs, it is just a function that takes a list of integers and returns an integer based on some calculations.
