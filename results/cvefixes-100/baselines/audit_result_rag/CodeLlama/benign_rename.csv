62,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918.

The code is using the `change_archived_books` function to toggle the archived status of a book, and then it is using the `remove_synced_book` function to remove the book from the synced list. Both of these functions are used in a controlled manner, and there is no evidence of any uncontrolled access to external resources.

64,CWE-863,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-863.

The code is using the `send_transactions` function to send a transaction to a contract, but it is not performing any authorization checks. This means that any user can send a transaction to the contract, regardless of their privileges or permissions.

In contrast, the `send_transaction` function in the original code is performing an authorization check before sending the transaction. This means that only users with the appropriate privileges and permissions can send a transaction to the contract.

Therefore, the `benign_send_transaction` function is not vulnerable to CWE-863, as it is not performing any authorization checks.",620,151,5.622206449508667
