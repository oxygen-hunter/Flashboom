73,CWE-93,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-93. The code uses the `str()` function to convert the value to a string, which will automatically handle any special characters, including CRLF sequences. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to a CRLF attack.",402,63,2.4470574855804443
74,CWE-79,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-79. The code is using the `urlquote` function to escape the URLs before passing them to the `client.post` method, which should prevent the URLs from being treated as safe. Additionally, the code is using the `REDIRECT_FIELD_NAME` constant to specify the name of the field that contains the URL, which should prevent the URLs from being treated as safe.",2320,96,3.709514856338501

77,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The code is using the `requests` library to make a GET request to the Dropbox share link, which is a valid and secure way to retrieve the contents of the file. The code is not vulnerable to SSRF because it is not making any requests to unexpected hosts or ports.",603,78,2.9033005237579346
78,CWE-116,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-116. The code properly encodes and escapes the user-supplied input, which prevents the attacker from injecting malicious commands.",1315,46,1.8198533058166504

80,CWE-601,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-601. The code uses the `get_object_or_404` function to retrieve the `Topic` object, which ensures that the object exists before it is used. Additionally, the code uses the `exclude` method to filter the `Topic` objects based on the `field_name` and `to_value` parameters, which ensures that the `Topic` object is not modified. Finally, the code uses the `update` method to update the `Topic` object, which ensures that the object is updated correctly.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-601, as it uses appropriate security measures to prevent the object from being modified in an unauthorized way.",879,174,6.444989204406738
81,CWE-264,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-264. The code properly implements token expiration by checking the user's enabled status before creating a new token.

82,CWE-78,"  NO. The given code is not vulnerable to CWE-78. It is using the `exec` function to execute the code in the `code` variable, which is a string that is retrieved from a trusted source (the `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile` function). The `exec` function does not allow the execution of arbitrary commands, and the code is not being executed with any special privileges. Therefore, there is no vulnerability in this code.",878,101,3.8965189456939697
83,CWE-22,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22. The code uses the `config.retrieveBoilerplateFile()` function to retrieve a file based on the provided document and extension, and then executes the code in the file using the `exec()` function. This means that the code is not vulnerable to path traversal attacks, as the file being executed is not determined by user input.",525,88,3.278287172317505
84,CWE-352,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-352. The code is using the `json` parameter to pass the request body, which is properly validated and handled by the FastAPI framework.

85,CWE-290,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-290. The code properly sanitizes the input data and validates the exclude list using a regular expression. The vulnerability is caused by improperly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks, but the code does not have any such vulnerability.",556,71,2.719701051712036
86,CWE-835,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-835. The code is using a while loop with a condition that can be influenced by an attacker, but it is not an infinite loop. The loop will exit when the buffer is empty, and the condition is not met. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-835.",758,79,3.079800605773926
87,CWE-444,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-444. The code is using the `smuggle_url` function to add a custom HTTP header to the request, which is a safe and legitimate use of the function. The vulnerability CWE-444 is related to the usage of outdated or incompatible HTTP protocol versions in the HTTP agents, which is not present in the given code.",1552,91,3.4106972217559814
88,CWE-79,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-79. The code properly escapes the reason message before using it in the error response, so it is not vulnerable to reflected XSS.",1818,45,2.0907673835754395
89,CWE-22,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-22. The code uses the `os.path.join()` function to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, and the `send_file()` function to send the file to the client. The `send_file()` function takes a `filename` parameter, which is the pathname of the file to be sent. The `os.path.join()` function is used to construct the pathname by joining the `settings.backup.folder` and the `filename` parameters. The `max_age` parameter is set to 0, which means that the file will be sent with the `Cache-Control` header set to `no-cache`. The `as_attachment` parameter is set to `True`, which means that the file will be sent as an attachment to the client.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-22 because it uses the `os.path.join()` function to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, and the `send_file()` function to send the file to the client. The `send_file()` function takes a `filename` parameter, which is the pathname of the file to be sent. The `os.path.join()` function",576,301,10.98438048362732

91,CWE-918,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to CWE-918. The code is using the `send_file` function from the Flask framework, which is designed to handle file downloads and is not vulnerable to the described vulnerability.

The `send_file` function takes care of validating the file path and ensuring that the file is served from a trusted source.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to CWE-918, which is a vulnerability that occurs when a web server does not properly validate the URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.",603,145,5.367242097854614
