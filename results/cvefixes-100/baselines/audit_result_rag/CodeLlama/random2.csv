The code is using the `requests` library to make HTTP requests, and it is not using the `requests.Session` object to make the requests. The `requests.Session` object provides a way to persist cookies and authentication across multiple requests, which can help prevent SSRF vulnerabilities.

However, the code is not using the `requests.Session` object, and it is not using the `auth` parameter to pass authentication information to the requests. This means that the requests are not being made with the same authentication information as the original request, which could potentially allow an attacker to bypass access controls.

The code is using the `op('&')` operator to perform a bitwise AND operation on the `role` field of the `User` model, which is a string. The `&` operator is used to perform a bitwise AND operation on the two operands, which in this case are the `role` field and the `constants.ROLE_ADMIN` constant. The result of the operation is a string that represents the bitwise AND of the two operands.

The code then checks if the result of the bitwise AND operation is equal to the `constants.ROLE_ADMIN` constant, which means that the user has the `ROLE_ADMIN` role. If the user has the `ROLE_ADMIN` role, the code proceeds to delete the user's data.

The vulnerability CWE-918 is related to the use of the `op('&')` operator in this context. The vulnerability is that the code is not properly validating the user's role before deleting their data.
