The code is vulnerable to a potential SSRF attack. 

Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled URL Execution:** The code fetches data from URLs based on the `content.id` and uses it to delete related data. This means an attacker could provide a malicious URL that points to a server they control. 
* **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The code doesn't validate or sanitize the URLs. An attacker could craft a URL that, when executed, could potentially allow them to access sensitive data or execute arbitrary commands on the server. 
* **CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery):** The code's reliance on external URLs makes it susceptible to SSRF attacks, which exploit vulnerabilities in web servers to execute arbitrary commands.
