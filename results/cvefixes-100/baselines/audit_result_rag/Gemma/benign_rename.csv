The code is vulnerable to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack. 

Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled URL Retrieval:** The code uses `ub.session.query()` to fetch data from various database tables.  It retrieves data based on the `content.id` and the `ub.User.id` relationship. 
* **Potential for Malicious URLs:** An attacker could craft a malicious URL that includes a database table name or a specific path. 
* **Unintended Access:** The code doesn't adequately validate or sanitize the URLs it retrieves. This allows the attacker to potentially access sensitive data or internal resources. 
* **SSRF Vulnerability:**  The code's reliance on `ub.session.query()` makes it susceptible to SSRF attacks.
