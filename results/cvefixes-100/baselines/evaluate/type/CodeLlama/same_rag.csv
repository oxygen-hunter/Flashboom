2,CWE-918,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-918. The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `socket.gethostbyname()` function, which can be used to perform a DNS lookup for a hostname. If an attacker can control the hostname being passed to this function, they can potentially perform a DNS rebinding attack, which can allow them to access the server's network interfaces and potentially bypass access controls such as firewalls.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should use a more secure method of performing DNS lookups, such as the `socket.getaddrinfo()` function, which allows the user to specify the IP address family and the socket type. Additionally, the code should validate the hostname being passed to the function to ensure that it is a valid hostname and not a malicious URL.","

The code does not use the `urllib` or `requests` library to retrieve the contents of a URL, so it is not vulnerable to SSRF. Additionally, the code does not use the `subprocess` library to execute a command, so it is not vulnerable to command injection.

However, the code does use the `valid_email` function to validate the email address, which could potentially be vulnerable to email address injection if the function is not properly sanitizing the input.","

The code retrieves the contents of a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination. This means that an attacker can make it appear that the server is sending the request, possibly bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `calibre_db.get_filtered_book()` function, which retrieves the contents of a URL or similar request from an upstream component. The function does not check the validity of the URL or the destination of the request, which allows an attacker to send a request to a URL that is not intended to be accessed by the server.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a request to a URL that is not intended to be accessed by the server, such as a URL that is not in the same domain as the server. The server will then retrieve the contents of the URL, which can be used to bypass access controls or to access sensitive information.

To fix the vulnerability, the code should check the validity of the URL or the destination of the request before retrieving the contents of the URL. This can be done","

40,CWE-918,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the code is using the `create_function` method to create a custom function that can be used in SQL queries. This function allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, which can lead to data disclosure, data tampering, and other types of attacks.

The vulnerability is further exacerbated by the fact that the code is using the `func.lower` method to convert the search terms to lowercase, which can make it easier for the attacker to perform SQL injection attacks.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to provide a specially crafted search term that can be used to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This can be done by providing a URL or similar request that is sent to the server, which can then be used to execute the SQL queries.

It is important to note that this vulnerability is not present in all versions of the code, and it is only present in versions prior to 0.6.18. Therefore, it is important to keep the code up to date with the latest version to avoid this vulnerability.","

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the code retrieves the contents of a URL provided by the user, without verifying that the URL is valid or that it is being sent to the expected destination. This allows an attacker to send a request to a URL that is not intended to be accessed by the server, potentially bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attacker from accessing the URL directly.

To fix the vulnerability, the code should verify that the URL is valid and that it is being sent to the expected destination before retrieving its contents. This can be done by checking the URL against a list of valid URLs or by verifying that the URL is being sent to the expected destination by checking the IP address or port number of the URL.","

The `create_transaction` function has a default value for `gateway_response` that is only used when the `gateway_response` parameter is not provided. This means that the function is vulnerable to timing attacks, as an attacker could potentially use a timing attack to determine the secret key and forge fake events. This could affect the database integrity, such as marking an order as paid when it is not.

The vulnerability is due to the fact that the default value for `gateway_response` is created using the `PaymentData` object, which could potentially reveal sensitive information about the payment. Additionally, the function does not properly validate the `gateway_response` parameter, which could allow an attacker to bypass the validation and create a fake `GatewayResponse` object.

To fix this vulnerability, the function should properly validate the `gateway_response` parameter and ensure that it is not used when it is not provided.

An http parameter may contain a URL value and could cause the web application to redirect the request to the specified URL. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts have a more trustworthy appearance.

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

[{'lang': 'en', 'value': ""FastAPI is a web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. FastAPI versions lower than 0.65.2 that used cookies for authentication in path operations that received JSON payloads sent by browsers were vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. In versions lower than 0.65.2, FastAPI would try to read the request payload as JSON even if the content-type header sent was not set to application/json or a compatible JSON media type (e.g. application/geo+json). A request with a content type of text/plain containing JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data would be extracted. Requests with content type text/plain are exempt from CORS preflights, for being considered Simple requests. The browser will execute them right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application. This is fixed in FastAPI 0.65.2. The request data is now parsed as JSON only if the content-type header is application/json or another JSON compatible media type like application/geo+json. It's best to upgrade to the latest FastAPI, but if updating is not possible then a middleware or a dependency that checks the content-type header and aborts the request if it is not application/json or another JSON compatible content type can act as a mitigating workaround.""}]

The vulnerability is caused by the use of unsanitized user input in the `json.loads()` function, which can lead to a log spoofing attack. An attacker can send a malicious agent data payload that contains a malformed JSON string, which can cause the `json.loads()` function to raise a `JSONDecodeError` exception.

87,CWE-444,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to CWE-444.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `smuggle_url` function, which allows an attacker to add arbitrary HTTP headers to a request made by the `yt-dlp` tool. This can cause the request to be interpreted differently by the server, potentially allowing the attacker to exfiltrate cookies or other sensitive information.

The `smuggle_url` function is used to add a `Referer` header to the request, which is used to identify the source of the request. However, an attacker can add a different `Referer` header, which can cause the request to be interpreted differently by the server. This can allow the attacker to access resources that they would not otherwise have access to, potentially allowing them to exfiltrate sensitive information.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `yt-dlp` tool should be updated to use a more secure method of adding HTTP headers to requests, such as using a secure proxy or VPN. Additionally, users should be advised to disable the `smuggle_url` function and only pass trusted sites with trusted content.","

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

96,CWE-918,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the code retrieves the contents of a URL provided by the user, without verifying that the URL is valid or that it is being sent to the expected destination. This allows an attacker to send a request to a URL that is not intended to be accessed by the server, potentially bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly.

For example, an attacker could provide a URL that points to a host or port that is not accessible from the server, and the server would retrieve the contents of that URL, potentially exposing sensitive information or causing the server to crash.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should verify that the URL is valid and that it is being sent to the expected destination before retrieving its contents. This can be done by using a library or framework that provides URL validation and verification, or by implementing custom validation and verification logic.","

100,CWE-918,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

The code uses the `os.path.join()` function to construct a file path for the uploaded book, which can be controlled by the attacker. The `os.path.join()` function takes two or more arguments, and the last argument is the file name. The code does not properly validate the file name, which allows an attacker to specify a file name that is not a valid file name. This can lead to the server retrieving the contents of a file that is not intended to be retrieved, which can be used to bypass access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly.

Additionally, the code uses the `datetime.utcnow()` function to set the creation and modification times of the book, which can be used to bypass access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly.
