[{'lang': 'en', 'value': ""Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly.

The provided Python code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-601 based on the information given. The code is for creating a new worker Home Server instance in a Matrix reference homeserver environment, and it does not involve user-controlled input that could be used in a Redirect-based phishing attack. The vulnerability described in CWE-601 typically involves web applications that accept user input to construct URLs for redirection, which is not the case in the provided code.","

This could cause Synapse to make requests to internal infrastructure. The type of request was not controlled by the user, although limited modification of request bodies was possible. For the most thorough protection server administrators should remove the deprecated `federation_ip_range_blacklist` from their settings after upgrading to Synapse v1.25.0 which will result in Synapse using the improved default IP address restrictions.

CWE description:
A web application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site, and uses that link in a Redirect. This simplifies phishing attacks.

Extended description:
An http parameter may contain a URL value and could cause the web application to redirect the request to the specified URL. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts have a more trustworthy appearance. Whether this issue poses a vulnerability will be subject to the intended behavior of the application. For example, a search engine might intentionally provide redirects to arbitrary URLs.

The provided code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to the way it handles the 'forgot' functionality in the login function. When the 'forgot' functionality is triggered, the code does not validate or sanitize the input before using it to potentially make a network request. An attacker could manipulate the 'forgot' functionality to make the server send a request to an internal or unintended destination, which could lead to information disclosure or other security issues.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the input used in the 'forgot' functionality to ensure that it only allows legitimate and expected requests. Additionally, the code should implement proper access controls and whitelisting to prevent unautrighted access to internal resources.","

The provided code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to the way it handles the 'forgot' functionality in the login process. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the following line:

```python
ret, __ = reset_password(user.id)
```

If the `reset_password` function internally uses the user's ID to construct a URL for sending the password reset email, and if the user ID is not properly sanitized or validated, an attacker could potentially manipulate the request to send the reset email to an arbitrary email address.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `reset_password` function only accepts and processes valid user IDs, and that it does not construct URLs or perform any network operations based on user-controlled input. Additionally, you should implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent SSRF attacks.

Here's an updated version of the code with improved security measures:

```python
def login():
    if current_user is not None and current_user.is_authenticated:
        return redirect(url_for('web.index'))
    if config.config_login_type == constants.LOGIN_LDAP and not services.ldap:
        log.error(u""Cannot activate LDAP authentication"")

The provided code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CWE-ID CWE-918. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not validate or sanitize the URLs or requests it retrieves from the database before using them. If an attacker can manipulate the database entries to include malicious URLs or requests, the server could inadvertently send requests to those malicious endpoints.

In the code, the `calibre_db.fill_indexpage` function is called with `sort_param` as an argument, which is derived from the `order` parameter. If an attacker can control the `order` parameter, they could potentially inject a malicious URL or request that the server would then process.

To mitright this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize any URLs or requests retrieved from the database before using them. This can be done by implementing proper input validation and whitelisting allowed URLs or requests. Additionally, the code should ensure that it only retrieves data from trusted sources and that it properly handles any errors or exceptions that may occur during the retrieval process.","

The provided code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CWE-ID CWE-918. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not validate or sanitize the URLs or requests it might send to external services or resources. If the `calibre_db.fill_indexpage` function or any other part of the code that interacts with external services does not properly validate the URLs or the content it retrieves, it could be exploited to send requests to unintended destinations.

For instance, if the `calibre_db.fill_indexpage` function or any other part of the code that interacts with external services is called with a maliciously crafted URL or request, it could lead to SSRF. This could allow an attacker to make the server send requests to internal or external services that it should not have access to, potentially leading to information disclosure, service disruption, or other security issues.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to ensure that any external requests made by the server are properly validated and sanitized. This includes checking that the URLs are expected and safe, and that any data retrieved from external services is handled securely. Additionally, implementing proper access controls and using secure coding practices can help prevent SSRPD.","

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, specifically reflected XSS, which is a type of CWE-79 vulnerability. The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles user-controlled input (URLs) and includes them in the HTTP response without proper sanitization or validation.

In the `test_security_check` function, the code iterates over a list of URLs, including some that are malicious (e.g., `http://example.com`, `https://example.com`, `ftp://exampel.com`, `//example.com`). These URLs are then used to construct a `nasty_url` by concatenating them with the login URL and the `REDIRECT_FIELD_NAME`. The `nasty_url` is then used to make a POST request with a username and password.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the code does not properly sanitize or validate the user-controlled input (the URLs) before including them in the HTTP response. An attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious URL that contains JavaScript code or other executable content. When the victim visits the generated URL, the malicious script would be executed in the context of the web server's domain, potentially leading to XSS attacks.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should","

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

Extended description:

            Improper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.
            Most products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, ""GET /index.html HTTP/1.1"" is a structured message containing a command (""GET"") with a single argument (""/index.html"") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (""HTTP/1.1"").
            If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

CWE description:
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

The browser will execute them right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application. This is fixed in FastAPI 0.65.2. The request data is now parsed as JSON only if the content-type header is application/json or another JSON compatible media type like application/geo+json. It's best to upgrade to the latest FastAPI, but if updating is not possible then a middleware or a dependency that checks the content-type header and aborts the request if it is not application/json or another JSON compatible content type can act as a mitigating workaround.""}]

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The provided `backup_download` function is vulnerable to path traversal attacks (CWE-22), which is a type of vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate file paths to access unauthorized files and directories. In this case, the function takes a `filename` parameter and uses it to construct a file path by joining it with a predefined backup folder path. If an attacker provides a `filename` that includes special path elements like ""../"", they could potentially read files outside of the intended backup directory.

For example, if the `filename` parameter is set to ""../etc/passwd"", the function would attempt to read the ""/etc/passwd"" file on the system, which could contain sensitive information. This is a classic example of a relative path traversal attack.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should sanitize the `filename` input by removing or encoding special path elements, or by using a whitelist approach to only allow filenames that match a specific pattern. Additionally, the application should ensure that the resolved file path is within the intended directory and does not escape the restricted folder.","

The server can be used as a proxy to conduct port scanning of hosts in internal networks, use other URLs such as that can access documents on the system (using file://), or use other protocols such as gopher:// or tftp://, which may provide greater control over the contents of requests.

The provided code snippet for `create_book_on_upload` does not appear to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described by CWE-918. The function does not handle or process any external URLs or requests that could be manipulated by an attacker to cause the server to make requests to unintended destinations. The code is focused on creating a book record with metadata and does not involve any network operations that could be exploited for SSRF.","
