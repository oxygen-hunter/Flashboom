The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-918, which is related to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses the `requests_session.request` method to send a request to the given URL without validating or sanitizing the input. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `url` parameter to point to an internal or unintended destination, causing the server to act as a proxy and access or retrieve data from that destination.

In the context of the CVE-ID CVE-2021-43780, the vulnerability is specifically related to Redash's implementation of URL-loading data sources. However, the provided code snippet does not directly relate to Redash, but the underlying issue of SSRF vulnerability is still relevant.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should implement proper input validation and sanitization for the `url` parameter. This can be done by ensuring that the URL is within a whitelist of allowed domains or by using a more secure method to retrieve data from external sources. Additionally, the code should consider implementing proper access controls and network security measures to prevent unautptaed access to internal resources.","
The CVE-ID is CVE-2021-43780. The CWE-ID is CWE-918.
CVE description:
[{'lang': 'en', 'value': ""Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly.

43,CWE-918," YES, the provided code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described by CWE-918.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not validate or sanitize the input data before using it to make requests or perform operations. In the case of the `render_books_list` function, the `data` parameter is used to determine which type of books to render. However, there is no validation or sanitization of this input, which means an attacker could potentially manipulate the `data` parameter to make the server retrieve data from unintended locations or perform actions on behalf of the attacker.

For example, an attacker could manipulate the `data` parameter to make the server retrieve data from internal network resources or other sensitive locations by using unexpected hosts or ports. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or bypassing of access controls.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to validate and sanitize the input data before using it in the code. This can be done by implementing input validation checks, whitelisting allowed values, and ensuring that the input data is properly sanitized before being used in any operations or requests. Additionally, implementing proper access controls and using secure coding practices can help prevent SSRF vulnerabilities.","

The provided code is vulnerable to SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) as described in the CWE-ID CWE-918 and CVE-ID CVE-2022-0939. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `calibre_db.fill_indexpage` function, which retrieves content based on a URL or similar request from an upstream component without sufficient validation to ensure the request is being sent to the expected destination.

In the code, the `sort_param` variable is derived from the `order` parameter, which is an external input. If an attacker can manipulate the `order` parameter to include a malicious URL or a URL that points to an internal network resource, the server could be tricked into making a request to that URL. This could potentially bypass access controls and allow the attacker to access sensitive information or perform actions on the server that they are not authorized to perform.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the `sort_param` input to ensure that it only contains valid sorting parameters and does not include any URLs or other potentially malicious content. Additionally, the server should implement proper access controls and network segmentation to prevent unauthorized access to internal resources.","

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as described in the CWE-918. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not show any explicit handling of URLs or requests that the server might make. If the `calibre_db.get_book_read_archived` function or any other part of the code makes a network request to an external service or URL based on user-controlled input or external data, and this input is not properly validated or sanitized, it could be exploited to cause the server to make requests to unintended destinations.

For example, if the `calibre_db.get_book_read_archived` function retrieves data from an external service using a URL that includes user-controlled input, an attacker could manipulate this input to cause the server to make requests to internal or sensitive systems. This could lead to information disclosure, unautrighted access, or other security breaches.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to ensure that any URLs or requests made by the server are strictly validated against a whitelist of allowed destinations and that user-controlled input is not used to construct these URLs or requests without proper sanitization and validation. Additionally, implementing proper access controls and network segmentation can help reduce the impact of","

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not show any explicit handling of URLs or requests that the server might make. If the `calibre_db.get_book_read_archived` function or any other part of the code makes HTTP requests to external services or retrieves content from URLs, and these URLs are not properly validated or sanitized, an attacker could manipulate these requests to target internal or unintended external resources.

For example, if the `calibre_db.get_book_read_archived` function retrieves data from a URL that is constructed using user-supplied input (such as `book_id`), and this input is not properly validated, an attacker could craft a `book_id` that includes a malicious URL. This could lead to the server making a request to an attacker-controlled server, potentially leaking sensitive information or allowing the attacker to bypass security controls.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to ensure that any URLs or external requests made by the server are properly validated and sanitized.

[{'lang': 'en', 'value': 'Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.25.0, requests to user provided domains were not restricted to external IP addresses when calculating the key validity for third-party invite events and sending push notifications. This could cause Synapse to make requests to internal infrastructure. The type of request was not controlled by the user, although limited modification of request bodies was possible. For the most thorough protection server administrators should remove the deprecated `federation_ip_range_blacklist` from their settings after upgrading to Synapse v1.25.0 which will result in Synapse using the improved default IP address restrictions. See the new `ip_range_blacklist` and `ip_range_whitelist` settings if more specific control is necessary.'}]

CWE description:
A web application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site, and uses that link in a Redirect. This simplifies phishing attacks.

Extended description:
An http parameter may contain a URL value and could cause the web application to redirect the request to the specified URL. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts have a more trustworthy appearance. Whether this issue poses a vulnerability will be subject to the intended behavior of the application. For example, a search engine might intentionally provide redirects to arbitrary URLs.

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, specifically reflected XSS (Type 1). The vulnerability arises from the way the code handles user-controlled input (the `bad_url` and `good_url` variables) and includes it in the URL without proper sanitization or validation.

In the `test_security_check` function, the `bad_url` and `good_url` variables are used to construct URLs that are then posted to the server using the `self.client.post` method. The `urlquote` function is used to URL-encode these variables, but it does not prevent the injection of malicious scripts.

The vulnerability is present in the following lines:

```python
nasty_url = '%(url)s?%(next)s=%(bad_url)s' % {
    'url': login_url,
    'next': REDIRECT_FIELD_NAME,

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to CWE-284, Improper Access Control, because it allows the deletion of a user without proper authorization checks. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the function `_delete_user` does not verify if the current user has the necessary permissions to delete another user. It only checks if there is an admin user present in the system, but it does not ensure that the current user is the admin themselves.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add an additional check to verify if the current user is an admin before allowing the deletion of another user. Here's an updated version of the function with the added check:

```python
def _delete_user(content, current_user):
    if not current_user.is_admin:

CWE description:
The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Extended description:

            Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:
            
               Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)
               Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and
               Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)
            
            When any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.
            There are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:
               
                  Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.
                  Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.

The provided code snippet is vulnerable due to the way it constructs the command line arguments for execution. Specifically, the issue arises from the concatenation of `plugin_names` into a single string and appending it directly to the `cmdline_args` list. This can lead to command injection vulnerabilities if `plugin_names` contains special characters or malicious input that can alter the intended command execution.

In the context of CWE-116 (Improper Input Handling), the vulnerability is related to the improper handling of user input, which can lead to unintended command execution. The code does not properly sanitize or escape the `plugin_names` input, making it susceptible to command injection attacks.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to validate and sanitize the `plugin_names` input before using it to construct the command line arguments. Additionally, using safer methods for command execution, such as parameterized commands or APIs that handle input sanitization, can help prevent such vulnerabilities.","

CWE description:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

Extended description:

            Improper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.
            Most products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, ""GET /index.html HTTP/1.1"" is a structured message containing a command (""GET"") with a single argument (""/index.html"") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (""HTTP/1.1"").
            If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

The provided code is vulnerable due to the way it handles authentication tokens. The vulnerability is related to the potential for token replay attacks. In the code, a token is generated and returned to the user after successful authentication. However, the code does not implement any mechanism to invalidate or expire the token after a certain period or after it has been used once. This means that if an attacker intercepts the token, they could potentially reuse it to gain unauthorized access to the system.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should implement token expiration and/or one-time use mechanisms.

CWE description:
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Extended description:

		   This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:
               
				 The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(""nslookup [HOSTNAME]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use ""exec([COMMAND])"" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

[{'lang': 'en', 'value': ""FastAPI is a web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. FastAPI versions lower than 0.65.2 that used cookies for authentication in path operations that received JSON payloads sent by browsers were vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. In versions lower than 0.65.2, FastAPI would try to read the request payload as JSON even if the content-type header sent was not set to application/json or a compatible JSON media type (e.g. application/geo+json). A request with a content type of text/plain containing JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data would be extracted. Requests with content type text/plain are exempt from CORS preflights, for being considered Simple requests. The browser will execute them right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application. This is fixed in FastAPI 0.65.2. The request data is now parsed as JSON only if the content-type header is application/json or another JSON compatible media type like application/geo+json. It's best to upgrade to the latest FastAPI, but if updating is not possible then a middleware or a dependency that checks the content-type header and aborts the request if it is not application/json or another JSON compatible content type can act as a mitigating workaround.""}]

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-290, which is related to improper input handling that can lead to spoofing attacks. In the given code, the `agent_right` key is accessed without checking if it exists in the `agent_data` dictionary. If `agent_data` does not contain the key 'allowlist', this will raise a `KeyError`. This can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted input that lacks the expected keys.

To fix this vulnerability, you should check if the 'allowlist' key exists in the `agent_data` dictionary before attempting to access it. Here's an updated version of the function:

```python
import json

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-444, which is related to HTTP smuggling. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `smuggle_url` function, which is not shown in the code snippet but is referenced. If `smuggle_url` is similar to the vulnerable `smuggle` function mentioned in the CVE description, it could allow an attacker to manipulate the HTTP headers being sent to the Vimeo server.

The `smuggle_url` function is likely used to set custom HTTP headers, such as the 'Referer' header, which is used in the code snippet. If an attacker can control the input to `smuggle_url`, they might be able to craft a request that causes the intermediary HTTP agent (like a proxy or firewall) to misinterpret the headers, leading to a smuggling attack. This could potentially allow the attacker to bypass security controls or inject malicious content.

To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure that any custom header setting functions like `smuggle_url` are designed to handle malformed input safely and consistently with how the ultimate destination (Vimeo server) would interpret the headers. Additionally, it's important to keep all dependencies up to date and follow best practices for secure coding to prevent such vulnerabilities.","

The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-79, which is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability arises from the way the error message is handled and potentially displayed to the user. If the `reason` string contains unescaped HTML or JavaScript, it could be executed in the context of the user's browser when displayed in the error response. This can happen if the error message is directly included in the HTML response without proper sanitization or escaping.

In the code snippet, the `reason` string is being passed through `force_text()` and then `json.dumps()`. While `json.dumps()` will escape certain characters, it may not be sufficient to prevent all XSS attacks, especially if the `reason` string contains complex HTML or JavaScript code. The vulnerability is more likely to be exploited when the error response is rendered in a context where HTML is interpreted by the browser, such as in an error page or a log viewer that displays the error message.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to ensure that any user-controlled input, including error messages, is properly escaped or sanitized before being included in the response. This can be done by using context-appropriate escaping functions that are designed to prevent XSS in the specific context where the data will be displayed.","

CWE description:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

Extended description:

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            There are three main kinds of XSS:
            
               
                  Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - 
         			The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - 
               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The provided code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the way it handles user-controlled input in the `custom_column_expected` dictionary. The values in this dictionary are hardcoded strings that could potentially contain malicious JavaScript code. If an attacker can manipulate the values of these fields, they could inject malicious scripts that would be executed when the `LocationTable` renders the custom fields.

For example, if an attacker can control the value of `custom_column_expected['text_field']`, they could set it to a string containing a `<script>` tag with malicious JavaScript code. When the `LocationTable` renders the `text_field`, the malicious script would be executed in the context of the user's browser, leading to a potential XSS attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly sanitize and escape any user-controlled input before rendering it in the `LocationTable`.

At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - 
               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.
            
            
            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

[{'lang': 'en', 'value': 'Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in GitHub repository janeczku/calibre-web prior to 0.6.18.'}]

CWE description:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

Extended description:
By providing URLs to unexpected hosts or ports, attackers can make it appear that the server is sending the request, possibly bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly. The server can be used as a proxy to conduct port scanning of hosts in internal networks, use other URLs such as that can access documents on the system (using file://), or use other protocols such as gopher:// or tftp://, which may provide greater control over the contents of requests.
