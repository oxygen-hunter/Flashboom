1,I-Worm.Archiver,"1. **YES**

2. **Detailed Explanation:**

The provided code appears to be **malicious**. There are several indicators of potentially dangerous behavior typically associated with malware:

### **Malicious Indicators:**

#### 1. **Registry Manipulation:**
- The code accesses Windows registry keys like:
  - `HKEY_USERS` and `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` for querying values related to user folders and WinZip paths.
  - `Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run` is often used by malware to achieve **persistence** by setting itself to run on system startup.

#### 2. **Self-Replication:**
- The function `CopyFile()` copies the current executable to a specific directory (`copyn`), naming it `Archiver.exe`. This is a common malware tactic to make a copy of itself in a new location.
- The program then attempts to execute this copy with the `-i` parameter, indicating a potential **installation process**.

#### 3. **ZIP File Infection:**
- The function `infzip()` iterates over `.zip` files in specified directories (`desktop`, `personal`, `favorites`, `C:\\`). It uses `WinExec()` to execute commands that appear to **add the copied executable to ZIP files**.
- This behavior suggests that the malware tries to **spread** by infecting ZIP archives, potentially targeting user-uploaded files.

#### 4. **Suspicious Use of MAPI API:**
- The program includes references to MAPI functions (`mSendMail`, `mLogoff`, `mLogon`, `mFindNext`, `mReadMail`). Although these functions are not explicitly called in the provided snippet, their presence indicates a potential capability for **email spreading**, possibly sending infected attachments to contacts.

#### 5. **Anti-Debugging Techniques:**
- The code uses `asm volatile("""" : : : ""memory"");`, which acts as a **memory barrier** to prevent the compiler from optimizing certain operations. This is a technique to hinder **static analysis** and reverse engineering.
- The function `__superImportant_function_AvoidModifications()` includes misleading comments and unnecessary complexity (e.g., `volatile` and `register` usage), suggesting an attempt to **obfuscate** its true purpose.

#### 6. **Use of ShellAbout() and MessageBox():**
- The program displays a message box with the text ""This new safety was coded by PetiK,"" which may act as a **social engineering tactic**, misleading users into thinking the program is legitimate.

### **Conclusion:**
This code exhibits several characteristics of a **classic file infector** or **worm**, including self-replication, infection of ZIP files, potential email spreading, and persistence mechanisms via the Windows registry. Based on these behaviors, it is highly likely that this code is **malicious** and could pose a significant **security risk**.",1281,596,18.59028458595276
2,I-Worm.WarGames,"1. **YES**

2. **Explanation**:
   This code contains clear signs of malicious behavior, indicating it is malware (specifically a worm) designed to spread and compromise systems. Below are key points highlighting its malicious nature:

   - **Self-Replication and Propagation**: 
     - The code includes routines to copy itself under different filenames and register in the system's startup (by modifying `WININIT.INI` and creating registry keys), ensuring persistence across reboots.
     - It also generates new executable names and propagates by copying itself as `article.doc.exe`, making it appear as a legitimate document to trick users.

   - **Antivirus and Security Disabling**:
     - The `StopAV` function explicitly targets and terminates various antivirus and firewall processes (like Norton Antivirus, ZoneAlarm, Panda Antivirus, etc.), disabling system protections and making the system vulnerable to further compromise.

   - **Email-Based Spread**:
     - Using MAPI (Mail API), the worm harvests email addresses and sends infected messages to contacts in the user’s address book. It includes a message encouraging recipients to open an attachment (`article.doc.exe`), thus spreading the worm further.
     - The code also includes functionality to construct and send email messages with misleading subjects (e.g., ""I send you this patch"") to make the email seem benign.

   - **File and Network Activity**:
     - The worm searches various directories (desktop, favorites, personal folders) for documents, which it potentially uses to gather information or as part of its payload.
     - Embedded assembly code attempts to verify network connectivity and interact with the internet, suggesting possible further exploitation or data exfiltration once it has established connectivity.

   - **Use of Shell Commands**:
     - The worm executes a `.vbs` (VBScript) file, created on the system, that likely assists in automating part of its infection process, such as accessing the Windows MAPI subsystem to send emails.

The presence of these techniques (self-replication, disabling security tools, spreading via email, registry modification for persistence, and network activity) all indicate a high risk, confirming this code is designed to perform malicious activities and pose a security threat.",3623,450,17.706965923309326
3,Worm.Win32.Warskype,"1. **YES**

2. **Explanation**:
   This code contains several signs of malicious activity specifically aimed at using Skype as a vector for spreading a worm. Key indicators of potential malware are as follows:

   - **Intent to Exploit Skype for Spread**: The code is crafted to use Skype as a distribution method by finding random Skype users and sending them a malicious URL. The line `sprintf(msg_cmd,""CHATMESSAGE %s Check this! http://marx2.altervista.org/surprise.exe"", chat_id);` specifically sends a URL pointing to an executable file, which is a common tactic in worms to spread malware to other systems.
   
   - **Automated User Search and Messaging**: The function `GetRandNick()` generates random usernames, and the `S3arch` function systematically searches for these users and attempts to message them every three minutes. This automated approach suggests an attempt to reach as many Skype users as possible, a behavior typical of worms or malicious bots.
   
   - **Malicious Payload Delivery**: The URL, ""http://marx2.altervista.org/surprise.exe"", is an executable likely containing malicious payload. This URL is systematically sent to discovered users, encouraging them to download and execute the malicious file, which would likely compromise their system.
   
   - **System Modifications and Process Manipulation**: The `RunSkype()` function searches the system registry for the Skype installation path and launches Skype if it’s found. The code also includes handling of messages to interface directly with Skype, potentially allowing it to act on the victim's behalf to send messages, a typical behavior of malware designed for social engineering or worm-like behavior.

   - **Unusual Persistence Mechanism**: The code creates a hidden window with the name ""WarSkype by [WarGame,#eof]"", which seems to be an identifier for the malicious process. This hidden window allows it to remain undetected while it interacts with Skype and sends out messages.

Overall, the code's behavior aligns with common patterns of malicious software designed to propagate via IM applications and encourage users to download potentially harmful software, indicating it is likely malware.",1645,435,24.25310778617859
4,RansomWar,"### Detection Report:

**1. YES**  
There are multiple vulnerabilities and security risks in the provided code, which suggests that it is indeed malware.

### Detailed Explanation:

This code contains a **ransomware** payload designed to encrypt files on a victim's machine, followed by certain anti-debugging measures to resist detection. Let's break down the key components that highlight the malicious nature of the code:

#### 1. **Encryption Routine (Ransomware Behavior)**
   - **Blowfish Encryption:** The function `Encrypt_File` encrypts files using the Blowfish algorithm. This is typically associated with ransomware, where files are encrypted and held for ransom.
   - **File Renaming:** After encryption, the file is renamed with a ""ransom"" extension, which is a classic behavior in ransomware (e.g., appending an extension like `.ransom`).
   - **File Search:** The `S3arch` function recursively searches for files to encrypt. It avoids certain file types such as `.dll`, `.exe`, `.ini`, and others commonly used by the system or necessary for operation, suggesting the code is focused on encrypting personal or user data files.
   - **File Exclusion Criteria:** The code specifically avoids encrypting files that are system-critical, reducing the chances of immediate detection or system instability.

#### 2. **Persistence Mechanism**
   - **Searching Drives:** The ransomware scans for drives (from `C:` to `Z:`) and encrypts files on fixed and remote drives (`DRIVE_FIXED` or `DRIVE_REMOTE`), which can affect local and network storage.
   - **Regular Execution:** The function `R4ns0m` runs in a loop, and every 10 minutes, it continues scanning and encrypting files. This periodic activity allows the ransomware to continue operating without user intervention.

#### 3. **Anti-Debugging Features**
   - **Debugger Detection:** The code includes an anti-debugging function `AntiDebug`, which uses `IsDebuggerPresent()` to detect if the program is being debugged. If it detects a debugger, it triggers a ""trap"" by opening a Notepad process repeatedly (`WinExec(""notepad.exe"", SW_SHOW)`), which serves as a distraction or attempt to disrupt analysis.

#### 4. **Stealth and Evasion**
   - **Hidden Execution and File Modifications:** The code has mechanisms to ensure that it is less likely to be discovered in the short term. The encrypted files are renamed with a custom extension, making it harder for security software to detect them based on file signatures alone.
   - **Threaded Execution:** The use of threads (`R4ns0m` and `AntiDebug`) allows the malware to continue its activities in the background, potentially without immediate detection by the user or security systems.

### Conclusion:
The presence of Blowfish encryption, file renaming, drive scanning, and anti-debugging behavior are all strong indicators of **malicious intent** typical of **ransomware**. The code also includes additional evasion techniques, such as creating a fake process to distract debuggers, which further strengthens the conclusion that this is a form of malware designed to **encrypt files for ransom**.

**Recommendation:** Immediate containment and removal actions should be taken if this code is detected on a system. The encryption process can render valuable data inaccessible, and further analysis of the behavior in a sandboxed environment is recommended to assess the full scope of the attack.",1337,705,15.1384916305542
5,Win32.Shithead,"1. YES

2. Detailed Explanation:

The provided code is a classic example of a simple self-replicating malware known as a companion virus. Here is a breakdown of the elements that indicate malicious intent:

- **Self-Replication:** The code attempts to replicate itself by searching for other executable files (`*.exe`) on the system using functions like `FindFirstFileA` and `FindNextFileA`. It then manipulates and creates a new version of these files by prepending an underscore (`_`) to the filename, which is a characteristic behavior of companion viruses. This suggests the intent to replicate itself across other executables on the system without the user's knowledge.

- **File Manipulation:** The code uses `DeleteFileA` to remove existing executables and `CopyFileA` to overwrite or create copies of itself. Such manipulations are intended to spread the virus and might cause disruptions in legitimate software execution, leading to potential data corruption or loss.

- **Execution Manipulation:** Once the target executable is identified and manipulated, it appears to convey a pop-up using `MessageBoxA`, indicating that the code is executing without the user's direct intent, which is indicative of typical malicious behavior. It serves as a signal to the author that the infection process is taking place.

- **Lack of User Consent:** The entire operation is executed without any user consent. It’s designed to stealthily find, modify, and replicate itself across the system, which poses a significant security risk as it can lead to unauthorized data access or system instability.

Due to these behaviors, the code poses a security risk and can be classified as malware. It shows key characteristics of a virus that can potentially compromise system integrity, cause data loss, or lead to unauthorized control over executable files. This kind of behavior is typically flagged by antivirus systems as a threat to system security.",648,373,9.714641571044922
6,Win32.Flea,"**Detection Report:**

1. **YES**
   
2. **Detailed Explanation:**

The code provided contains multiple indicators of potentially malicious behavior. Below are the key aspects that suggest this might be a malware or a virus:

- **String Reference (Win32.FleA Virus)**: 
   The code includes a string that identifies it as `Win32.FleA Virus`, which is a clear indication that this is labeled as a virus. It also mentions ""My 1st Win32 Virus!"", which implies it is an intentionally crafted piece of malware.

- **File Copying Operations**:
   The use of the `CopyFileA` function and the logic of copying files from one location (presumably a virus file) to another, especially within the `FindNext` loop, is typical of a self-replicating virus. The malware is likely designed to propagate by copying itself to other executable files.

- **File Search Mechanism**:
   The code uses `FindFirstFileA` and `FindNextFileA` to search for `.EXE` files in the current directory. This is another indication that the code may be attempting to infect other executable files it finds, which is a classic behavior of a virus.

- **Error Message and Behavior Control**:
   The message box (`MessageBoxA`) is used to display a fake error message (""Windows Error 300687""), which suggests an attempt to mislead the user. This could be part of the obfuscation or social engineering tactic, commonly found in malware.

- **No Explicit Malware Signature**:
   While the code does not directly engage in activities like network attacks or data theft, the combination of file copying and manipulation suggests that it is a form of self-replicating malware, a typical behavior for many viruses. The code does not explicitly show behavior like data exfiltration or remote control, but it is still a security risk.

- **External Functions**:
   The `extrn` directives for functions like `GetCommandLineA`, `lstrcpyA`, `FindFirstFileA`, `CopyFileA`, `FindNextFileA`, `MessageBoxA`, and `ExitProcess` all point to the usage of basic Windows API functions to control the behavior of the system and the files, typical of malware's use of system-level API calls for malicious activities.

Given these points, this code exhibits behavior consistent with a virus, particularly one that replicates and tries to infect other files, and could therefore be considered a security risk.",492,512,16.889740228652954
7,Win32.Crash,"### Detection Report:

1. **YES** - The code contains a vulnerability or security risk.

2. **Detailed Explanation:**

   - **Type of Malware:** The provided code is a **Companion Virus**, which means it does not directly modify or overwrite the infected program but rather attaches itself to another executable. It exploits the system by searching for `.exe` files and then renames them to `.dat` files while copying itself as `crashoverwrite.exe` in the directory.
   
   - **Infecting Mechanism:** 
     - The malware uses Windows API functions like `FindFirstFileA`, `FindNextFileA`, `CopyFileA`, and `CreateFileA` to search for `.exe` files and rename them to `.dat` files. 
     - It copies its own executable (`crashoverwrite.exe`) to the infected directory to propagate further.
     - The code manipulates file names by appending `.dat` to them, which could cause confusion and prevent the legitimate execution of the original executable files.
   
   - **Lack of Payload:** According to the comment, the virus does not have a malicious payload or weapon (e.g., no direct data destruction or system exploitation). However, its **companion virus** nature itself presents a risk by corrupting the file system and potentially confusing users or system administrators with renamed files.
   
   - **Potential Security Issues:**
     - The code does not contain direct destructive payloads but can lead to potential system disruptions due to file name manipulation.
     - The malware doesn't target DOS files or other file formats but exploits the `.exe` files in a directory, which is a classic indicator of a companion virus.
     - Its ability to copy itself (`CopyFileA`) and execute via `WinExec` means that once it runs, it can spread to other directories or systems if not properly contained.

   **Conclusion:** The code is a **virus** with a potential security risk due to its ability to manipulate executable files, leading to system instability or disruption, even though it lacks a direct payload.",1550,421,18.91232204437256
8,bot,"### Detection Report:

1. **YES** – The code contains multiple potential security risks and malicious activities.

2. **Explanation**:
   
   The provided code exhibits several key indicators of malicious activity, such as:
   
   - **Malicious iframes**: The code injects hidden `<iframe>` elements with sources pointing to external URLs (`http://YourDomain.com/BotNet/CC/index.php` and `http://YourDomain.com/miner.html`). These could be used to load malicious content or to communicate with a command-and-control server, which is characteristic of botnet activity or cryptojacking (mining cryptocurrency).
   
   - **DDoS functionality**: The `ddos()` function repeatedly sends HTTP GET requests to a target site (`TARGET-SITE.com`) using the `$.getScript()` method, which is commonly used to perform denial-of-service (DoS) or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks by flooding a server with requests.
   
   - **Flooding requests**: The `imgflood()` function continuously sends requests to the target server (`TARGET-SITE.com`) every 10 milliseconds. This is a typical DoS or DDoS attack method, aimed at overwhelming the server with a high volume of requests.
   
   - **Keylogging**: The code listens for `keypress` events, storing each keypress in the `buffer` array. Periodically, this captured key data is sent to an external server (the `attacker` variable points to `http://YourDomain.com/BotNet/CC/KeyLogger/?c=`), indicating keylogging behavior. This could be used to steal sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, etc.
   
   - **Data exfiltration**: The keylogging data is periodically sent out in JSON format via an image request, which is a technique used to covertly exfiltrate data without triggering typical network security alarms.

### Conclusion:
The code exhibits multiple behaviors that are associated with malicious activities, such as botnet communication, DDoS attacks, cryptojacking, and keylogging. These activities pose significant security risks, including server overload, unauthorized data collection, and potential system compromise. Therefore, it clearly contains vulnerabilities and should be classified as malicious.",364,460,23.211666107177734
9,miner,"1. **YES**

2. **Explanation:**
   The code you provided contains the use of the **CoinHive** library, which was a well-known JavaScript-based cryptocurrency miner. CoinHive allowed websites to mine **Monero** (XMR) using visitors' CPU power without their explicit consent. While this can technically be a legitimate use case for certain purposes (e.g., monetization through user mining), CoinHive's usage was often controversial and frequently associated with malicious practices, such as **cryptojacking**.

   - **Cryptojacking**: This is the practice of secretly using someone else's device to mine cryptocurrency, often without their knowledge or consent. Websites embedding CoinHive would run this script in the background, mining Monero while visitors were on the site.
   
   - **Ethical Concerns**: Even though the code includes a `miner.didOptOut(14400)` function to allow users to opt out after a specific time period, this doesn't resolve the core issue. It is essential to have user consent before using their computational resources. Without clear and transparent user consent, this can lead to ethical issues and potential security risks.

   - **Security Implications**: Although this specific code might not exploit vulnerabilities in the website directly, it introduces a risk in terms of privacy and security:
     - **Resource Consumption**: The miner could potentially cause high CPU usage on the client’s machine, leading to performance issues, which could affect the user's device.
     - **Reputation Risk**: Embedding this script without informing users could harm the reputation of the website owner or lead to legal consequences depending on the jurisdiction (e.g., violating GDPR).

   **Conclusion**: The use of CoinHive is considered risky, often leading to a security risk or attack vector (cryptojacking), and is no longer a recommended practice. CoinHive has also been shut down (as of March 2019), meaning the provided script could break or have unintended effects. Thus, I classify this code as containing a **security issue** and **potential attack** risk.",149,419,29.446301460266113
10,Backdoor.PHP.Llama,"1. **YES**

2. **Explanation**:

   The provided PHP code contains multiple vulnerabilities that can lead to serious security risks, including command injection and file upload issues. Here are the specific risks:

   - **Command Injection**:
     - This code accepts commands via the `$_POST['king']` parameter and executes them directly in the shell using `popen()` without sufficient sanitization. If an attacker provides a command in the `king` field, they could execute arbitrary shell commands on the server, leading to unauthorized access or potential data theft.
     - The `$_POST['dir']` parameter allows attackers to change the current directory for command execution, which can further facilitate unauthorized access to sensitive files and directories.
   
   - **File Upload Vulnerability**:
     - The form allows uploading files through the `$_FILES['fila']` parameter to the server. However, this functionality is not restricted by file type or size, nor is there any validation for the uploaded file’s content. Attackers can upload a malicious PHP file or another script, which could then be executed to gain further control of the server.
   
   - **Output of System Information**:
     - The code outputs system information like `php_uname()`, which can expose valuable details about the server’s OS and configuration, aiding attackers in crafting tailored exploits.
     - The checks for `open_basedir`, `disable_functions`, and `safe_mode` status also reveal security configurations, providing insights to attackers on potential restrictions that may limit their actions.

   **Conclusion**: The code allows for remote command execution and unrestricted file uploads without adequate security controls, making it highly vulnerable to remote attacks and system compromise.",779,342,15.775912523269653
