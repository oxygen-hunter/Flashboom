This ensures that the function can only be called once, and any subsequent calls will fail.

Therefore, this code is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack.",2669,128,4.666891574859619
136,denial of service,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `record_human_readable_blockhash` function, which uses a modifier called `one_time_use` to ensure that the function can only be called once. However, this modifier does not take into account the possibility of a reentrancy attack, where a function calls an external contract before it resolves any effects.

In this case, the `record_human_readable_blockhash` function calls the `getWords` function of the `wordbot` contract, which can potentially cause a reentrancy attack if the `wordbot` contract is malicious. If the `wordbot` contract is malicious, it can call the `record_human_readable_blockhash` function again before the first call has resolved, causing the function to be called multiple times and potentially drain the contract of funds.

Therefore, the `record_human_readable_blockhash` function is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the potential for a reentrancy attack.",1145,245,8.272148132324219
137,denial of service,"  NO, this code is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The `record_human_readable_blockhash` function is marked with the `one_time_use` modifier, which ensures that the function can only be called once. The modifier checks that the `human_readable_blockhash` array is empty, and if it is, it allows the function to be called.

Therefore, if the `record_human_readable_blockhash` function is called once, it will fill the `human_readable_blockhash` array with the desired values, and subsequent calls to the function will fail due to the `one_time_use` modifier. This ensures that the function is only called once, and any attempts to call it again will be prevented.",963,175,6.169728994369507
138,denial of service,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `record_human_readable_blockhash` function, which uses a modifier called `one_time_use` to ensure that the function can only be called once. However, this modifier does not take into account the possibility of a malicious user calling the function multiple times.

A malicious user could potentially call the `record_human_readable_blockhash` function multiple times, causing the contract to run out of gas and fail. This could lead to a denial of service attack, where the contract is taken offline and cannot be used by legitimate users.

To fix this vulnerability, the `one_time_use` modifier should be modified to also check for the number of times the function has been called. This can be done by adding a counter variable that is incremented each time the function is called, and then checking if the counter is greater than 1. If the counter is greater than 1, the function should not be allowed to execute.",953,234,7.8651158809661865
