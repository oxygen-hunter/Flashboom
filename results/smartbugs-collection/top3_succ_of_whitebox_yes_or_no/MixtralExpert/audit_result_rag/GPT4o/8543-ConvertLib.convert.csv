2. **Line 15 (`return amount * conversionRate`)**: The multiplication of `amount` and `conversionRate` may cause an overflow if the result exceeds the maximum value of a `uint`. In Solidity versions below 0.8, no checks are performed for such overflows, making this function potentially vulnerable.",820,145,6.1692516803741455

85,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because it still contains the same line `count -= input;` that can lead to an integer underflow, which is a form of arithmetic vulnerability. If `input` is greater than `count`, this subtraction could cause an underflow, allowing unintended behavior or exploitation.",890,61,5.863075017929077
86,arithmetic,"YES, it is vulnerable because the same arithmetic operations that can lead to overflows or underflows are still present in the contract. Specifically:

The multiplication of `amount` and `conversionRate` could result in an arithmetic overflow if the product exceeds the maximum value that a `uint` can store.

The vulnerability lies in the same function as in the previous contract, specifically the `rand` function. This function attempts to generate randomness using the previous block's hash (`block.blockhash(lastBlockNumber)`) and some arithmetic manipulations.

- Line 19: `if(numElements == array.length)` dynamically increases the array size by 1 in each iteration when needed.
- Line 20: `array.length += 1;` resizes the array, which is an expensive operation in terms of gas.

The contract's `lendGovernmentMoney` function, in particular the lines resetting `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` to empty arrays (lines 46 and 48), can lead to a **denial of service** attack.

This loop appends 350 addresses to the `listAddresses` array, potentially causing the contract to consume excessive gas as the array grows, leading to a denial of service (DoS). When the array becomes large, future calls to the `ifillArray` function could require more gas than allowed, preventing successful execution and making the contract vulnerable to being permanently unusable.",988,130,9.92750859260559

This can result in a denial of service (DoS) because if the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that has a fallback function designed to fail or consume all the available gas, it will prevent further bids. This is because the `send` function returns false if it fails, which will trigger the `require` statement and revert the transaction.
