11,access control,"YES. The vulnerability in the provided smart contract code is within the `MultiOwnable` contract, specifically the `newOwner` function. The `newOwner` function allows any existing owner to add a new owner without any restrictions or checks on who can be made an owner. This lack of access control on who can become an owner can lead to unauthorized additions to the owners list, potentially allowing malicious actors to gain control over the contract's functionality. Additionally, this could lead to misuse of the `withdrawAll` function in the `TestContract`, which allows owners to withdraw the contract's balance.",1503,120,1.9432435035705566
12,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable due to improper access control. The vulnerability lies in the constructor function `missing()`, which is mistakenly a regular public function rather than a constructor due to its declaration without the proper constructor keyword. This allows anyone to call the `missing` function and take ownership of the contract by setting themselves as the owner. This access control issue can lead to unauthorized access and potential fund withdrawal by an attacker.",1241,85,1.7095067501068115
13,access control,"YES. The vulnerability in the Rubixi contract code stems from the improper handling of the constructor. The function `DynamicPyramid()` is intended to be the constructor but is incorrectly named and follows the older Solidity convention for constructor declarations. In versions of Solidity before 0.4.22, the constructor was defined by naming it the same as the contract. If the contract name was ever modified but the function name wasn't, it would be possible for any user to call this function and set themselves as the creator of the contract. 

In the provided code, the contract name is `Rubixi` while the function `DynamicPyramid()` is intended to act as a constructor. However, since there is no function named `Rubixi` to serve as the constructor, `DynamicPyramid()` is just a regular, callable function that anyone can call to set themselves as the creator, bypassing access control.",3161,181,3.166203022003174
14,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is in the `withdraw` function of the `Wallet` contract, specifically due to a flawed access control check. The check uses `require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);`, which is logically incorrect and should be `require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);` instead. This could allow users to withdraw more funds than they actually have, or inadvertently fail in legitimate cases where the user tries to withdraw their entire balance.

In addition, the lack of checks or mechanisms to restrict function calls to authorized users, particularly in the `migrateTo` function, can be an access control vulnerability since it lets anyone who becomes the `creator` inadvertently (if the contract's constructor logic is mistakenly repeated) migrate the entire balance. This is a fundamental access control flaw.",1358,160,2.3505866527557373
15,access control,"YES, the smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `IamMissing` function of the `Missing` contract. This function allows anyone to call it and set themselves as the owner of the contract. Once they become the owner, they can call the `withdraw` function to transfer all the ether in the contract to themselves. This is a critical access control issue that allows attackers to gain unauthorized control over the contract's funds.",1251,88,1.8232004642486572
16,access control,"YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper access control for the `set` function in the `Map` contract. 

This `set` function is public, allowing anyone to modify the values in the `map` array. This means that any user can overwrite data in the map, including mapping new keys or altering existing ones. This behavior should be restricted to authorized addresses only, typically the contract owner or other predefined roles. 

The vulnerability does not lie with the typical `access control` practices like using `tx.origin` or misusing `delegatecall`, but rather with the inadequate checks on who can call the crucial `set` function, which might lead to unauthorized manipulation of the contract's state. 

Similarly, while not directly related to the access control itself, there is a general lack of visibility restrictions and potential for unintended use as the contract allows any public user to interact with its map data and alter it freely.",1316,195,3.2902214527130127
17,access control,"YES, the second smart contract code is also vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in the `Proxy` contract's `forward` function. The `delegatecall` allows the contract to execute code in the context of another contract, which can lead to unintended consequences if not properly controlled. Since there is no access control in place to restrict who can call the `forward` function, it allows any user to execute arbitrary code in the context of the `Proxy` contract, potentially bypassing intended access controls or modifying the state in unintended ways. This can be exploited by executing code that manipulates the contract's storage or performs unauthorized transactions.

Additionally, while the `FileCoinCash` contract itself doesn't directly exhibit access control issues, it can be indirectly affected if it interacts with the `Proxy` contract's vulnerable function. Therefore, proper access control should be implemented to prevent unauthorized use of critical functions.",1219,182,3.0590708255767822
18,access control,"YES. The vulnerability in the Wallet contract lies in the lack of proper access control on the `PushBonusCode`, `PopBonusCode`, and `UpdateBonusCodeAt` functions, which can be called by any user. An attacker could manipulate the `bonusCodes` array because these functions are not restricted to the `owner` or any authorized address. The `PopBonusCode` function, in particular, is flawed because it decrements the array length without any meaningful check, allowing someone to potentially manipulate the array size, which is not inherently safe even though the array bounds cannot be negative due to Solidity's unsigned integers.",1412,125,2.0672192573547363
19,access control,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the constructor of the `Missing` contract. The function named `Constructor` is intended to be the constructor of the contract, but because of a capitalization mismatch (Solidity constructor functions should match the contract name exactly), it is a regular public function rather than the constructor. This allows any external user to call the `Constructor` function after the contract is deployed, and set themselves as the owner by changing the `owner` variable.",1241,104,2.227844476699829
20,access control,"YES, the vulnerability still exists in the updated code for the `Wallet` contract. The `initWallet` function can be called by any address at any time because it is a public function. This means any user can reset the `creator` address to themselves or another address they control, which leads to an access control vulnerability. This issue allows unauthorized users to gain control over the wallet's critical functions such as `migrateTo`, which can transfer the entire balance of the contract to another address. This constitutes a severe flaw in the access control logic of the contract.",1376,114,2.270725727081299
21,access control,"YES. The vulnerability in this new code lies in the use of `tx.origin` for access control, specifically in the `sendTo` function of the `MyContract`. Using `tx.origin` for authorization is dangerous because it allows for phishing attacks where a malicious contract could trick the owner into executing a transaction that appears to originate from the owner himself. Instead, for secure access control, it's recommended to use `msg.sender`. This ensures proper validation of the direct caller of the function, not just the original agent triggering the execution chain.",1208,108,2.10239315032959
22,access control,"YES, the smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `Wallet` contract, specifically in the `refund` function. This function allows any user to call it and transfer their entire balance back to their own address. However, this function doesn't check for any specific conditions or limits on who can call it and how it's used, which can lead to potential misuse or abuse, especially if the contract logic or balance integrity is compromised elsewhere.

25,access control,"YES, the smart contract code is vulnerable due to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `Phishable` contract on the line: `require(tx.origin == owner);`. This line uses `tx.origin` for authentication, which is insecure. 

An attacker can use a phishing attack to trick the owner into sending a transaction from their address, allowing the attacker to initiate a malicious contract that calls the `withdrawAll` function in `Phishable`. Since `tx.origin` would still point to the owner, the require check would pass, allowing the attacker to drain the funds from the contract to the recipient address they control.",1226,127,2.2803657054901123
26,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The `FibonacciBalance` contract is vulnerable because it unsafely uses the `delegatecall` function without proper access controls. Specifically:

1. **Line 31**: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(fibSig, withdrawalCounter));` allows arbitrary execution of code within the context of the `FibonacciBalance` contract. This grants attackers the ability to change sensitive state variables such as `calculatedFibNumber` and control the withdrawal amount without restriction.

2. **Line 38**: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(msg.data));` in the fallback function allows attackers to send arbitrary data that can trigger any function defined in the `FibonacciLib` contract or even manipulate the state of the `FibonacciBalance` contract itself.

The delegatecall vulnerability arises from the fact that it can execute functions of another contract with the calling contract’s storage, potentially leading to unauthorized state changes and fund transfers without proper access control mechanisms.",1642,198,2.8785412311553955
27,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The `Command` function utilizes the low-level `call` function to send ether and execute arbitrary data on an address. This function does not check the return value of the `call`, which may fail and return `false` without reverting the transaction.

1. **Line 54:** `owner2.send(sum2);`
2. **Line 65:** `owner.send(balance);`

The `send` function in Solidity is a low-level function that only forwards 2300 gas, which may not be enough to complete specific actions (like storage writes). Additionally, if it fails, it returns false instead of throwing an error, which means failing to check its return value could lead to funds being lost or not properly transferred.

29,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The vulnerability in the provided code lies in the use of the low-level call function within the `Command` function. In the `Command` function, the following line is potentially vulnerable:

```solidity
adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);
```

When using the low-level `call` function, errors do not automatically propagate or bubble up, which means if the call fails, the transaction will not revert unless explicitly managed. This function simply returns a boolean indicating success or failure, and in this code, the return value is unchecked. This can lead to serious security issues because if the `call` fails, funds could be sent to an unintended address, or critical operations might not execute as expected, leading to potentially significant loss or unwanted behavior. 

Developers must ensure that any `call`, especially when involving Ether transfers or external calls, checks the returned boolean value to verify that the operation was successful and otherwise handle the error accordingly.",1531,190,4.657843112945557
30,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the contract is vulnerable because it contains multiple instances where `send()` is used without checking the return value. As explained, using low-level functions like `send()` can lead to fail-open vulnerabilities if their return values are not checked, which could lead to unintended outcomes if the send operation fails. This is evident in the lines where `msg.sender.send()`, `currentMonarch.etherAddress.send()`, and `wizardAddress.send()` are used without checks.",2820,94,2.2833845615386963

The vulnerability lies in the use of `caddress.call(id, from, _tos[i], v);` within the `transfer` function of the `airPort` contract. This is an unchecked low-level call. In Solidity, low-level calls, like `call`, do not propagate errors—if the called function fails, the call will return `false` but will not revert the transaction. This means the loop will continue executing despite potential failures in executing the `transferFrom` function on the target contract. If the return value of such low-level calls is not checked, it can lead to fail-open scenarios where tokens or ether are incorrectly handled or not transferred as intended.

Specifically, in the `WithdrawToken` function of the `Token` contract and the `WithdrawToHolder` function of the `TokenBank` contract. The `call()` function does not revert the transaction if it fails, it only returns `false`. Therefore, if the `call()` fails (e.g., if the recipient address is a contract that does not implement a payable fallback or if it runs out of gas), the failure will not result in a transaction revert, potentially leading to a situation where tokens or ether are not actually sent but the contract state might still reflect a successful operation.

38,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of unchecked low-level calls in the `TokenBank` contract. Specifically, the `WithdrawToken` function in the `Token` contract uses a low-level `call` to attempt a token transfer:

```solidity
token.call(bytes4(sha3(""transfer(address,uint256)"")),to,amount);
```

This call does not check the return value, which means that if the transfer fails, the contract will not be aware of it and may continue executing as if the transfer succeeded.

Similarly, in the `WithdrawToHolder` function in the `TokenBank` contract, another unchecked low-level call is used:

```solidity
_addr.call.value(_wei);
```

This call also does not check the return value, which means the ether transfer might fail, and the contract will not handle this failure appropriately, leading to potential issues such as losing track of the ether balance or other unintended consequences.

These unchecked low-level calls can be exploited, leading to unintended state changes or financial loss. To mitigate this vulnerability, the return value of low-level calls should be checked and appropriately handled to ensure correct contract behavior.",1958,236,3.5715951919555664

The second smart contract code is vulnerable because it exhibits the same vulnerability related to unchecked low-level `call` usage as explained for the first contract. In the `fundPuppets` function, the `call` method is used to send ether to the addresses stored in the `extra` mapping without checking the return value of the `call`. If the call fails, it does not rollback the transaction, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds. Additionally, in the `Puppet` contract, the fallback function uses another low-level `call` to forward any ether received, also without checking the return value.

- `winner.send(winAmount);` in the `sendToWinner` function.
- `msg.sender.send(this.balance);` in the `withdrawLeftOver` function.

Both instances of `send` do not check the returned boolean value for success, which can lead to situations where the intended transfer of Ether fails, but the contract logic proceeds as if it succeeded.

The vulnerability stems from the use of the `call` function in the `airdrop` contract without checking its return value. This is an example of an unchecked low-level call issue. The `call` function will return a boolean value indicating success (true) or failure (false), but the current code does not check this return value. If the call fails, the function will still continue to execute and eventually return true, potentially misleading the caller into thinking that all transfers have been successful when they might not have been.

66,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability stems from the use of low-level calls in the `TokenBank` contract, specifically in the `WithdrawToken` and `WithdrawToHolder` functions:

1. **Unchecked Low-Level Call**: In the `WithdrawToken` function, there's an unchecked call to the `call` method: 
   ```solidity
   token.call(bytes4(sha3(""transfer(address,uint256)"")), to, amount);
   ```
   This low-level call will not revert the transaction if it fails; it simply returns false. If the return value is not checked, it could lead to the assumption that the transfer succeeded, allowing potential inconsistencies or exploits.

2. **Unchecked Low-Level Call with Ether Transfer**: In the `WithdrawToHolder` function, there's another unchecked low-level call:
   ```solidity
   _addr.call.value(_wei);
   ```
   Similar to the first vulnerability, this call does not check whether the ether transfer was successful. If it fails, the function will not revert, which can lead to unauthorized withdrawals or inconsistent contract states.

Both cases illustrate how the absence of return value checks in low-level calls can lead to potential security risks and unexpected contract behaviors.",1958,251,3.64974308013916
67,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability lies in the use of the low-level `call` function within the `Command` function of the `HomeyJar` contract:

```solidity
function Command(address adr, bytes data) payable public {
    require(msg.sender == Owner);
    adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);
}
```

The `call` function is a low-level function that does not throw exceptions if it fails; instead, it returns false. Since the return value of `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)` is not checked, any failure in the call (such as if the address `adr` does not exist or is not payable) will go unnoticed, and the function will continue executing without reverting. This can lead to unexpected behaviors and security vulnerabilities, such as ether being sent without assurance of successful execution.",1619,171,3.3652756214141846
68,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the `keepMyEther` contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of the low-level call function in the `withdraw` function: 

```solidity
msg.sender.call.value(balances[msg.sender])();
```

The problem here is that the return value of the call is not checked. This means that even if the call fails (for example, if the recipient is a smart contract that does not implement a payable fallback function or intentionally causes the transaction to revert), the subsequent line that sets the user's balance to zero will still execute. An attacker could exploit this by repeatedly calling the `withdraw` function and draining the contract of its funds without their balance being properly deducted after a failed withdrawal attempt.

Proper handling involves checking the return value of the call, often with something like:

```solidity
require(msg.sender.call.value(balances[msg.sender])());
```

This would ensure that the balance is only reset to zero if the transfer is successful. Additionally, using `transfer()` or `send()` (with return value checks) instead of `call()` for transfers can be a safer pattern, although they do come with their own considerations regarding gas limits and handling contracts with complex logic in their fallback functions.",1260,247,4.219032287597656

The `call` method is used to send Ether to `msg.sender`, which can be a contract. If that contract has a fallback function that calls `CashOut` again before the balance is updated, it can repeatedly withdraw more funds than it should, leading to a reentrancy attack. This is because the balance is decreased only after the Ether transfer is made, allowing the attacker to exploit this gap repeatedly.",1692,159,2.7407801151275635
115,reentrancy,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability arises from the usage of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `CashOut` function of the `ETH_VAULT` contract. This call can transfer control to a malicious contract before decrementing the caller's balance, allowing for repeated withdrawals of the same amount by exploiting the reentrancy vulnerability. The potential attack allows a malicious contract to recursively call the `CashOut` function and drain funds from the `ETH_VAULT` contract.",1692,109,2.053293466567993
116,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function within the `WALLET` contract, specifically at the line where `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` is used. This is a classic example of a potential reentrancy attack vulnerability. The `call` method is a low-level function that can invoke a fallback function on the target address, which may be an untrusted contract. If a malicious contract is the `msg.sender`, it could execute malicious logic in the fallback function to call `Collect` again before the original call finishes processing. This can result in the contract's internal balance not being updated correctly, allowing attackers to drain funds. 

To mitigate this vulnerability, consider using `transfer()` or `send()` functions for Ether transfers, as these limit the number of gas sent to the fallback function and help prevent reentrancy attacks. Additionally, always update the state variables before making any external calls.",1778,192,3.6031928062438965
117,reentrancy,"YES, the `Reentrancy_cross_function` contract in the given code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. 

The issue is in the `withdrawBalance` function where the contract sends Ether to `msg.sender` using the `call` method without updating the balance first. This allows the caller's contract to recursively call `withdrawBalance` before the balance is set to zero, potentially draining the contract's funds. 

The `call.value(amountToWithdraw)` pattern allows for reentrancy because control is transferred to `msg.sender`'s fallback function, which can then invoke `withdrawBalance` again before the `userBalances[msg.sender]` is set to zero. This enables an attacker to repeatedly withdraw the same balance.",1364,148,2.5744383335113525
118,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance()` function of the `Reentrance` contract. It allows reentrancy attacks by using `msg.sender.call.value(userBalance[msg.sender])()` to send Ether before setting the user's balance to zero. This allows an attacker to call `withdrawBalance()` recursively and drain the contract's funds.",1313,75,1.552628993988037
119,reentrancy,"YES

The second smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack, similar to the first one. The vulnerability lies in the `CashOut` function, which uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. This line of code performs an external call to `msg.sender` while still having the contract's state in a potentially inconsistent condition (because `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;` is executed after the call). An attacker can exploit this by creating a malicious contract that re-enters the `CashOut` function before the balance is updated, allowing them to withdraw more funds than they should be able to. To protect against this vulnerability, d developers should consider using a ""checks-effects-interactions"" pattern, where state changes are made before any external calls.",1766,156,4.588776350021362
120,reentrancy,"YES, the given smart contract is vulnerable. 

The `CashOut` function in the `PrivateBank` contract uses the low-level `call` method to send ether to `msg.sender`. This allows for reentrancy because `call` does not update the contract's state before transferring control to the callee. In this case, the balance is reduced only after the ether has been sent. An attacker can exploit this by creating a contract with a fallback function that calls `CashOut` again before the balance is updated, potentially draining the contract's funds.",1668,113,2.1873695850372314
121,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. In the `PRIVATE_ETH_CELL` contract, the vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function, specifically in this line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This low-level call sends Ether to the calling address (`msg.sender`) without updating the sender's balance before the call is made. If the calling address is a contract with a fallback function that calls `Collect` again (or any function that initiates a withdrawal), it could repeatedly withdraw funds before the original function call finishes, leading to a reentrancy attack and potentially draining the contract. To mitigate this, balances should be updated before making any external calls.",1820,145,2.4682118892669678
122,reentrancy,"YES, the `Private_Bank` contract in the second code snippet is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `CashOut` function where `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` is used. This line of code sends ether to `msg.sender`, allowing for the possibility of a reentrancy attack because it hands over control to the calling contract before updating the internal state with `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;`. If `msg.sender` is a contract that implements a fallback function, it can recursively call `CashOut` to withdraw funds repeatedly before the state update occurs, potentially draining the contract's ether balance.",1682,131,2.734449625015259
123,reentrancy,"YES. The given smart contract code for `U_BANK` is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function, specifically at the line where `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` is used to send Ether. This allows an external contract to call back into the `Collect` function before the state (i.e., balance of the account) is updated, potentially enabling an attacker to drain the contract's funds. 

The second part of the code, which describes the `FileCoinCash` token, does not seem to contain any direct reentrancy vulnerabilities as it mostly manages token balances and does not involve calling external contracts to send Ether.",1778,137,2.659605026245117
124,reentrancy,"YES, the first contract ""PrivateBank"" is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability is due to the fact that it uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` to send Ether, which allows an external contract to make repeated calls back to the `CashOut` function before the balance is reduced. This can be exploited to drain funds from the contract. The second part with the ""FileCoinCash"" contract, however, does not showcase any reentrancy vulnerability as it does not contain any Ether transfer logic susceptible to such an attack.",1668,112,2.0803635120391846
125,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the `BANK_SAFE` contract within the `Collect` function, where the line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())` allows an external call before updating the state (i.e., reducing the balance of the `msg.sender`). This can be exploited by a malicious contract through a fallback function, leading to potential multiple withdrawals before the state is properly updated.",1822,94,2.0174262523651123
126,reentrancy,"YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability exists in the `withdrawBalance` function within the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract. The function sends Ether to the caller using `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""")`, which effectively allows the caller’s code to execute and potentially call `withdrawBalance` again before the function execution is completed. This allows the caller to repeatedly drain the contract's balance before the line `userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;` is executed, as the state update is set after the Ether transfer, leaving the contract open to a reentrancy attack.",1280,130,2.3355154991149902
127,time manipulation,"YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability arises from the use of `block.timestamp` in the `TimedCrowdsale` contract's `isSaleFinished` function. Since `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners, it introduces the potential for timestamp manipulation. The miner has the ability to influence the precise time of a block within reasonable bounds, which could result in the function `isSaleFinished` returning a manipulated value. This dependency on `block.timestamp` for critical functionality, such as determining the sale's end, can be exploited, making it a security concern.",1188,119,2.719101905822754
128,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability arises from the use of `block.timestamp` for generating randomness in the `randomGen` function. As explained previously, `block.timestamp` is susceptible to manipulation by miners, which makes it unreliable for critical operations like generating random numbers or relying on precise time conditions. This vulnerability is also present in the `payOut` function, where the condition `now - rand > 24 hours` depends on a random timestamp potentially generated by a miner-manipulated `block.timestamp`. This could lead to unfair advantages or exploits within the contract.",1423,118,2.001837968826294
129,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability in the `Governmental` contract lies in its reliance on `block.timestamp` for determining investment timing, which can be manipulated by miners. This vulnerability is present in the `lastInvestmentTimestamp` being set using `block.timestamp`. Miners have some control over this value, enabling them to influence the conditions under which the `resetInvestment` function can be called, potentially allowing them to exploit the contract for unfair advantages.",1591,95,1.8789865970611572
130,time manipulation,"YES

The smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The `Roulette` contract uses `now` (an alias for `block.timestamp`) to determine whether the conditions for transferring the contract's balance are met. Since miners can manipulate the timestamp within a small range, they can potentially ensure that the condition `now % 15 == 0` is met, allowing them to win the entire balance of the contract.

This vulnerability is related to the reliance on `now` for randomness, which is insecure due to miners' influence over the block timestamp. Additionally, the use of `now` in the expression `require(now != pastBlockTime);` and the subsequent update of `pastBlockTime = now;` doesn't prevent this manipulation. It merely ensures that no two transactions occur within the same block but does not mitigate the core issue.",1290,170,2.501309871673584
131,time manipulation,"YES, the EtherLotto smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` for generating randomness. The line:

```solidity
var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;
```

relies on `block.timestamp` to produce a pseudo-random number. However, since miners have control over the timestamp, they can manipulate it within a certain range. This allows a miner to potentially influence the outcome of the random number generation, which could affect the fairness of the lottery by allowing miners to gain an advantage.",1400,114,2.318495512008667
132,short addresses,"YES, the smart contract code is vulnerable to a short address attack. The vulnerability arises because the `sendCoin` function in the `MyToken` contract does not have any mechanism in place to ensure that the input for the address parameter is correctly validated and padded. This lack of validation could allow an attacker to craft a transaction that intentionally misrepresents the address and amount. As a result, there is a risk of the EVM or client improperly encoding arguments, similar to the short address attack vulnerability present in the first code.",1448,106,1.8810689449310303
133,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is a denial of service related to the function `emptyCreditors()` in the `DosGas` contract. This function attempts to clear the `creditorAddresses` array if its length exceeds 1500. However, if the gas required to clear a large array exceeds the block gas limit, the transaction may never complete successfully, leading to a denial of service. The `creditorAddresses` array might grow indefinitely due to repeated calls to `addCreditors()`, making it practically impossible to clear the array once it grows too large, thus making the function inoperable and blocking further operations that rely on it.",1416,134,2.5256309509277344
134,denial of service,"YES, the initial contract `DosNumber` is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the potentially high gas cost of the `insertNnumbers` function. The vulnerability arises from dynamically increasing the size of the array within the `for` loop without any upper limit on `numbers`, making the function execution cost potentially exceed the block gas limit, resulting in a denial of service.",1516,77,1.5452017784118652
135,denial of service,NO,2490,1,0.9710705280303955
136,denial of service,"YES, the first part of the code is vulnerable. The `refundAll` function in the `Refunder` contract uses the `send` method which returns a boolean value indicating success or failure. If any user's address does not accept ether or if there is another issue causing the send to fail (like an out-of-gas error), the `require` statement will revert the transaction. This means that a single failure in sending funds to any address in the list will result in the entire refund process being halted, causing a denial of service.

The second part of the code (`FileCoinCash`) does not have the described vulnerability.",1399,127,2.0316002368927
137,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability in the given code lies in the `DosOneFunc` contract, specifically in the `ifillArray()` function, due to a potential denial of service attack. The `for` loop inside the `ifillArray()` function can cause the transaction to run out of gas when it repeatedly attempts to iterate 350 times and push elements into the `listAddresses` array, especially as the array grows larger with subsequent calls. Once the gas limit for a block is exceeded, none of the operations within the function would execute, creating a denial of service scenario.",1293,116,2.2741780281066895
138,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in the `DosAuction` contract in the `bid` function. Specifically, the line `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` can lead to a denial of service attack. This is because sending Ether with `.send()` forwards only a limited amount of gas, and if this send operation fails (for example, if the `currentFrontrunner` address is a contract with a fallback function that consumes more gas or reverts), the entire transaction will revert, preventing completion of the bid process. This effectively means that a malicious or badly behaving `currentFrontrunner` can prevent other bidders from successfully placing bids.",1286,138,4.048101425170898
