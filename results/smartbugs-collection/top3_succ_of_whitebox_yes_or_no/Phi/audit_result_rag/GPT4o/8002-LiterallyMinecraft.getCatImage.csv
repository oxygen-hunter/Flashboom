11,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `MultiOwnable` contract's `newOwner` function. This function allows any external address to effectively add itself as an owner by calling `newOwner` with its own address. The function sets the `owners` mapping for the specified address to the caller's address, which does not enforce any proper access control, allowing unauthorized users to add themselves as owners. This can lead to unauthorized access to functions guarded by the `onlyOwner` modifier, including critical functions like `withdrawAll` in the `TestContract` and `LiterallyMinecraft` contracts.",2766,119,2.515479326248169

The vulnerability in the contract lies in the function `missing()`, which acts like a constructor due to its name but is accessible as a public function because it uses an older version of Solidity (pre-0.4.22). This allows anyone to call the `missing()` function and reset the owner of the contract to their address, leading to a takeover of the contract.

The vulnerability in the given smart contract code is similar to the previously identified access control issue. The constructor function `DynamicPyramid()` is incorrectly named and does not match the contract name `Rubixi`. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, this allows any user to call `DynamicPyramid()` to overwrite the `creator` address with their own. As a result, they can gain control over functions restricted by the `onlyowner` modifier, such as `collectAllFees`, `collectFeesInEther`, `collectPercentOfFees`, `changeOwner`, `changeMultiplier`, and `changeFeePercentage`. This is an access control vulnerability because it allows unauthorized users to access and execute restricted functions.",4425,146,2.652255058288574

The vulnerability in the original smart contract code lies in the `withdraw` function, specifically the line `require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);`. This should instead be `require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);`. The current condition allows any user to attempt to withdraw more than their balance, which will always pass since the incorrect comparison is being used. However, this doesn't functionally impact any funds for a specific user due to the subsequent logic, it represents a logical vulnerability and reflects a misunderstanding or potential mistake that could lead to different, more severe issues if the function's internal logic changes in the future. Moreover, there should be considerations for implementing proper access control across functions that could impact the state significantly, like `withdraw` and `migrateTo`.",2621,151,2.4482619762420654

The vulnerability in the code is due to the `IamMissing` function in the `Missing` contract, which sets the `owner` variable to `msg.sender` and is publicly accessible. This function allows anyone to call it and become the new owner of the contract. As a result, they can then call the `withdraw` function to transfer the contract's balance to themselves. This is a classic example of an access control vulnerability where critical ownership functionality is left unprotected.",2515,97,1.817765712738037

The smart contract is vulnerable due to access control issues. Specifically, the contract allows the `set` function to be called by anyone. This function modifies the `map` data structure, and there's no restriction on who can call it. This lack of access control could allow unauthorized users to modify the map, potentially leading to unintended behavior or exploitation. Functions that change the state of the contract should be restricted to authorized addresses or roles, such as only allowing the owner or designated users to modify the `map`.",2579,103,2.298630952835083
17,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The `forward` function in the `LiterallyMinecraft` contract uses `delegatecall`, which allows the callee to execute code in the context of the caller's contract. This can be exploited if an attacker provides a malicious contract as the `callee`, allowing them to potentially execute arbitrary code and compromise the contract, especially since there are no access control checks to restrict who can call the `forward` function.",2482,90,2.074690818786621
18,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability stems from access control issues in the `Wallet` contract. Specifically, functions such as `PushBonusCode`, `PopBonusCode`, and `UpdateBonusCodeAt` are public, allowing any address to call them and manipulate the `bonusCodes` array. This lack of access control allows unauthorized users to add, modify, or remove bonus codes, potentially leading to unauthorized actions and compromising the integrity of the bonus codes data.

Additionally, the `PopBonusCode` method contains a logical error with the line `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length);`. This requirement is always true because the length of an array is non-negative, allowing any caller to decrease the array length and potentially remove bonus codes without restriction.

The smart contract is vulnerable due to improper access control in the `initWallet` function. The `initWallet` function is publicly accessible and allows anyone to set the `creator` variable to their own address. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to take control of functions restricted to the `creator`, such as the `migrateTo` function, which allows the transfer of the entire contract balance to a specified address.

21,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the usage of `tx.origin` in the `sendTo` function for access control. Using `tx.origin` to validate the caller's address allows for phishing attacks where a malicious contract can trick an end-user into calling the vulnerable contract. This could enable unauthorized transfer of funds because `tx.origin` would still refer to the original sender instead of the immediate caller of the function. Instead, `msg.sender` should be used for more secure access control.",2471,104,3.1216561794281006
22,access control,"YES. 

The vulnerability in the smart contract code lies in the `refund` function. This function allows any user to call it and transfer the entire balance associated with their address back to themselves without any restriction or authorization check. This means that there is no access control implemented to prevent unauthorized or malicious withdrawals. Unlike the `withdraw` function, which limits the amount to be withdrawn to the caller's balance, the `refund` function allows any funds associated with an address to be fully refunded to that address without any checks. 

Additionally, this contract's `migrateTo` function is restricted to the contract creator, as it uses `require(creator == msg.sender);`. However, if there is a logic mistake in considering who should call `refund`, it can lead to improper fund access for any address. 

Though the problem description mentions vulnerabilities related to the `msg.sender.transfer(balances[msg.sender]);`, it's crucial to recognize the lack of an authorization check on the `refund` function as contributing to an access control vulnerability.",2659,207,3.5383121967315674
23,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The `sudicideAnyone` function is publicly accessible without any access control restrictions, allowing anyone to call it.

The vulnerability in the contract is an access control issue. Specifically, the `changeOwner` function does not have any access control modifier applied to it, allowing any external user to call this function and change the owner of the contract.

25,access control,"YES

The smart contract code is vulnerable due to the usage of `tx.origin` for access control. In the `withdrawAll` function, the contract checks if `tx.origin` is equal to `owner` to authorize the withdrawal. This is a common vulnerability because `tx.origin` can be manipulated by attackers through phishing attacks. An attacker can trick the owner into sending a transaction that involves this contract, allowing the attacker to withdraw funds. Therefore, using `tx.origin` for authorization is insecure. Instead, the contract should use `msg.sender` to correctly identify and restrict the caller who directly invoked the contract function.",2489,125,2.3477706909179688
26,access control,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable due to improper access control. The `FibonacciBalance` contract uses the `delegatecall` function to forward calls to the `fibonacciLibrary`, specifically in the `withdraw` function and the fallback function. This makes it susceptible to various access control vulnerabilities.

1. **Delegatecall in Line 31 (`withdraw` function):** The `withdraw` function uses `delegatecall` to call a function on the `fibonacciLibrary`. This means the called function will execute in the context of the `FibonacciBalance` contract, with access to its storage and balance. If an attacker can control the `fibonacciLibrary` address or manipulate it, they can execute arbitrary code in the context of the calling contract, potentially causing unauthorized state changes or withdrawals.

2. **Delegatecall in Line 38 (Fallback function):** The fallback function uses `delegatecall` with the provided `msg.data`, which allows any calldata to be executed by the `fibonacciLibrary`. If this isn't properly controlled, it can enable attackers to execute arbitrary functions within the `FibonacciBalance` contract context.

In both cases, the use of `delegatecall` without proper restrictions introduces a major security risk by allowing the `fibonacciLibrary` to access and modify the state of the `FibonacciBalance` contract, increasing the chances of unauthorized access and manipulation.",2906,277,4.014772415161133

This low-level call does not check the return value, which can lead to the transaction proceeding even if the call fails. This can introduce fail-open vulnerabilities, where expected behavior does not occur if the call fails, potentially allowing funds to be lost or the contract to be left in an inconsistent state.

The smart contract is vulnerable due to the use of low-level calls (`send`) without checking their return values. Specifically, in the lines:
- `owner2.send(sum2);` 
- `owner.send(balance);`

These lines attempt to transfer Ether using `send`, which can fail silently if, for example, the recipient is a contract with a fallback function that uses more than 2300 gas (the default gas stipend for `send`). When `send` fails, it returns `false`, but since the return values are not checked, the contract continues execution without handling the failure.

The given smart contract is vulnerable due to the use of the `send` function without checking its return value. This vulnerability is similar to the one previously identified in the `KingOfTheEtherThrone` contract. Specifically, the `send` function is used at multiple points:

1. `msg.sender.send(valuePaid);` in the function `claimThrone` during a refund when the amount paid is less than the current claim price.
2. `msg.sender.send(excessPaid);` in the function `claimThrone` to refund excess payment.
3. `currentMonarch.etherAddress.send(compensation);` in the function `claimThrone` to send compensation to the previous monarch.
4. `wizardAddress.send(amount);` in the function `sweepCommission` without verifying the result.

These calls are not checked for successful execution (i.e., the return value is not checked). This can result in funds not being transferred as expected, creating a vulnerability that can lead to a loss of funds or other unintended behaviors.",4084,213,3.597595453262329

This is a form of unchecked low-level call vulnerability. When using `call` in Solidity, if the target function execution fails, it returns false rather than throwing an exception. This means that without checking the return value of the call, the contract assumes it succeeded even when it may have failed, potentially leading to inconsistencies or loss of funds. The problem occurs on the line:

```solidity

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the `send` function without checking its return value. In the contract, the `send` function is used twice:

1. In the `cash` function: The line `winner.send(subpot);` attempts to send Ether to the winner without checking if the transaction succeeded. If the `send` operation fails, it will not revert the state changes, possibly leading to inconsistencies or loss of funds.

2. In the fallback function: The line `msg.sender.send(msg.value-value);` attempts to refund any excess Ether sent by the participant without verifying the success of the transaction. A failure in this refund operation won't revert the rest of the transaction, potentially leading to participants losing money or unintended Ether remaining in the contract.

The smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of low-level calls in Solidity without checking the return values. Specifically:

1. The `WithdrawToken` function in the `Token` contract uses `token.call(bytes4(sha3(""transfer(address,uint256)"")),to,amount);` to attempt a token transfer. This call does not check the return value, which means if the token transfer fails, there will be no indication, and the execution will continue. This can lead to unexpected outcomes where the contract believes a transfer was successful when it wasn't.

2. Similarly, the `WithdrawToHolder` function in the `TokenBank` contract uses `_addr.call.value(_wei);` for transferring Ether. This call also does not check the return value, meaning if the call fails (for example, due to the recipient contract running out of gas), the transaction will not be reverted, and the contract state will not properly reflect the failed transfer.

The smart contract code is vulnerable to front-running attacks. Front-running occurs when a malicious actor can observe a transaction in the mempool (pending transactions) and preempt it by sending their own transaction with a higher gas fee. This allows them to execute their transaction before the original one.

In the code provided, both the `setReward` and `claimReward` functions in the `EthTxOrderDependenceMinimal` contract are potentially vulnerable to front-running:

1. **`setReward` function**: The `owner.transfer(reward);` line transfers the existing reward to the owner, and then updates the `reward` with the value sent in the current transaction (`reward = msg.value;`). A front-runner could exploit this by observing a transaction with a high reward value being set and preempt it, setting their own transaction with a higher fee to transfer funds first.

2. **`claimReward` function**: The `msg.sender.transfer(reward);` line transfers the reward to the claimant, and subsequently the `claimed` flag is set to `true`. If the transaction is front-run by another party with the correct submission value, that party could claim the reward before the original transaction is executed.

These functions are prone to being executed in an unintended order if another user offers a higher gas price for their transaction, hence allowing them to manipulate the intended flow of funds.",2619,281,5.582465171813965
74,front running,"YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the same front-running attack as outlined in the explanation. The vulnerability arises in the function `solve(string solution)`, which requires a correct solution to claim a reward. When a valid solution is broadcast in a transaction on the Ethereum network, a malicious actor observing the pending transactions can copy the solution and submit their own transaction with a higher gas fee. This would allow the malicious actor's transaction to be prioritized and mined before the original, effectively front-running the original user and claiming the reward.",2565,107,3.0313518047332764

The smart contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks. The vulnerability lies in the `play` function where players submit their chosen numbers for the game. Since the blockchain is public, an attacker can observe a player's submitted number and submit their own transaction with a higher gas fee, effectively front-running the legitimate player.

The smart contract is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities. This is evident in the operations on the `count` variable within the functions `overflowaddtostate`, `overflowmultostate`, and `underflowtostate`, which use addition, multiplication, and subtraction without any overflow or underflow checks. Additionally, integer operations in functions like `overflowlocalonly`, `overflowmulocalonly`, and `underflowlocalonly` are susceptible even though they only affect local variables, as these operations do not have built-in checks to prevent wrapping around in Solidity versions prior to 0.8.

The vulnerability is due to the potential for integer underflows in lines of code similar to this one: `require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);`. This check does not prevent the subtraction operation in the following line `balances[msg.sender] -= _value;` from resulting in an underflow, which would occur if `_value` is greater than `balances[msg.sender]`.

The smart contract is vulnerable due to its flawed approach to generating randomness. It relies on block properties and contract state to produce a random result, which can be predicted or influenced by malicious actors. Specifically, the use of `block.coinbase`, `msg.sender`, and `block.difficulty` as seeds in lines 101, 103, and 105 can be manipulated. Miners could influence the block.coinbase, and block.difficulty can be somewhat predictable. The msg.sender is known, especially if the sender is the one triggering the randomness, thus allowing them to alter the outcome of random number generation. These factors make the randomness algorithm susceptible to exploitation.",4255,134,3.6915342807769775

The vulnerability lies in the use of the low-level call function `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. This can lead to a reentrancy attack because the external call is made before the contract's state is updated (i.e., before `acc.balance` is decremented by `_am`). An attacker can exploit this by making a recursive call to the `Collect` function, draining funds from the contract in multiple iterations before the `acc.balance` is finally updated.",3049,97,2.3321287631988525
98,reentrancy,"YES. The vulnerability in the provided smart contract is due to the use of `msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)();` in the `withdrawFunds` function. This line allows the `msg.sender` to call external contracts before the internal state of the contract is updated. As a result, an attacker can exploit this by re-entering the `withdrawFunds` function and repeatedly withdrawing funds, draining the contract's balance. The contract's state change, specifically updating the balance and the `lastWithdrawTime`, happens after the call, making it susceptible to a reentrancy attack.",2673,119,2.5142970085144043

The vulnerability is present in the `Collect` function of the `DEP_BANK` contract, where it uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. This is a low-level function call that transfers Ether to an account and allows that account to execute arbitrary code before the next line of the `Collect` function (which updates the balance) is run. If the recipient is a contract, it can re-enter the `Collect` function, causing a reentrancy attack where the balance can be drained.",3085,115,2.4137825965881348
100,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function where the contract transfers Ether to the `msg.sender` using a low-level call (`msg.sender.call.value(_amount)()`) and then updates the balance afterward.

101,reentrancy,"YES, the provided smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability is present in the `withdraw` function, where the contract sends ether to the `msg.sender` using the `call.value(amount)()` method before updating the `credit[msg.sender]` balance. This allows the attacker to re-enter the `withdraw` function and drain the contract funds before the balance is updated, leading to potential fund loss.",2559,86,2.0435264110565186
102,reentrancy,"YES, the given smart contract code for `MY_BANK` is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The vulnerability arises from the use of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `Collect` function. This low-level call allows an external contract to take control before the `acc.balance` is updated. If an attacker's contract is the `msg.sender`, they can manipulate this entry point to repeatedly call the `Collect` function, potentially draining funds from the `MY_BANK` contract before the balance is reduced.",3041,105,2.0901458263397217
103,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability exists in the `Collect` function of the `PENNY_BY_PENNY` contract. It uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` to send Ether, which allows for a reentrancy attack.

The code should instead use the `transfer` or `send` methods, or follow a checks-effects-interactions pattern to prevent reentrancy.",3215,112,2.400510549545288
104,reentrancy,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `getFirstWithdrawalBonus` function. It first updates the rewards for the recipient and calls `withdrawReward(recipient)`. However, this call can make an external contract execute `getFirstWithdrawalBonus` again before the function completes, allowing the rewards to be manipulated inappropriately. The lack of updating the `claimedBonus` flag before the external call permits this reentrant behavior, leading to a potential security vulnerability where an attacker can drain more rewards than intended.",2678,112,2.7420763969421387
105,reentrancy,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function of the `MONEY_BOX` contract, where it uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` to transfer ether to the caller. This allows the caller to re-enter the `Collect` function before the balance is updated, potentially allowing them to repeatedly withdraw funds beyond their balance limit. The balance should be updated before making the external call to avoid this vulnerability.",3209,96,2.209296941757202
106,reentrancy,"YES, the ACCURAL_DEPOSIT contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability is primarily located at the following point:

- In the `Collect` function, the code uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`, which transfers Ether to the caller without updating the balances first. This allows an attacker to re-enter the `Collect` function and call it repeatedly before the balance is decremented, allowing the attacker to drain funds from the contract through reentrancy.",3169,97,2.0493152141571045

108,reentrancy,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. This vulnerability arises because the `WithdrawToHolder` function, located towards the end of the contract, uses a low-level call (`_addr.call.value(_wei)()`) to send Ether to an address. This method does not transfer control back to the smart contract immediately and allows external contracts to re-enter the same function before the contract's state is updated to reflect changes. Specifically, the holder's balance (`Holders[_addr]`) should be reduced before making the external call to prevent reentrancy, as seen from the following code snippet:

```solidity
function WithdrawToHolder(address _addr, uint _wei) 
    public
    onlyOwner
    payable
{
    if(Holders[_addr]>0)
    {
         
        if(_addr.call.value(_wei)())
        {
            Holders[_addr]-=_wei;
        }
    }
}
```

To mitigate this, the balance deduction in `Holders[_addr]` should occur before making the call, preventing attackers from recursively calling the function and draining funds.",3136,225,3.3513236045837402
109,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability is similar to the situation described in the first set of contracts, where the `attack` contract can exploit the `airDrop` function in the `ModifierEntrancy` contract. The `supportsToken` modifier, when called through an attacker contract, allows the `airDrop` function to be called again before the initial `airDrop` call completes, enabling the attacker to continuously increase their `tokenBalance` without meeting the `hasNoBalance` requirement intended to limit successive calls.",2820,113,2.155320644378662
110,reentrancy,"YES, the provided smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability is in the `CashOut` function, which uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. This call transfers ether to the caller without updating the contract's internal state before the transfer. Therefore, a malicious caller can recursively call `CashOut` within the fallback function and drain funds from the contract before the balance is deducted. To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balances before making external calls, or use `transfer` or `send` methods rather than `call.value()`, to mitigate the potential reentrancy attack.",2991,126,2.2581257820129395
111,reentrancy,"YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability exists in the `Collect` function of the `PERSONAL_BANK` contract. Specifically, the line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

performs an external call to the `msg.sender` using the low-level `call` function, which transfers Ether to the address and allows it to call back into the contract before the function concludes. This external call occurs before the contract adjusts the balance of the sender, allowing a malicious sender to recursively call `Collect` and potentially drain funds from the contract before its balance is updated.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the adjustment of the sender's balance should be made before the external call, or use the ""checks-effects-interactions"" pattern to ensure external calls are made after all state changes.",2955,115,2.072904348373413
116,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability exists in the ""Collect"" function of the WALLET contract, where the line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())` allows for a reentrancy attack. This line sends ether to `msg.sender` using the low-level `call` function, which forwards all gas and does not check for success unless explicitly handled. The issue is that the user's balance is only updated (decreased) after the external call to `msg.sender`, allowing a reentrant fallback function in `msg.sender` to call `Collect` again before the balance is updated, potentially draining the contract's funds. This classic reentrancy vulnerability was famously exploited in the DAO attack. To prevent such an issue, it's a common practice to use the 'Checks-Effects-Interactions' pattern, which involves updating state (i.e., reducing the balance) before making any external calls.",3041,184,3.007063388824463
117,reentrancy,"YES, the given smart contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The vulnerability resides in the `withdrawBalance` function.

121,reentrancy,"YES

The vulnerability in the smart contract lies within the `Collect` function. The contract uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`, which is a low-level call that allows sending Ether to `msg.sender`. If the recipient is a contract, it can execute code in its fallback function, and it can call back into the `Collect` function before the subtraction `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;` is executed, allowing for a reentrancy attack. This could enable an attacker to drain the contract by repeatedly calling the function and withdrawing funds without updating their balance.",3083,116,2.2120437622070312
122,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the function `CashOut(uint _am)` of the `Private_Bank` contract. The line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())` is susceptible to a reentrancy attack. This is because it sends Ether to an external address using a low-level `call`, allowing the receiving contract to execute code and potentially call `CashOut` again before the original call's state has been updated (e.g., before `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;` is executed).

126,reentrancy,"YES

The given smart contract code in the `LiterallyMinecraft` contract contains a `withdrawBalance` function that is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. Similar to the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract you provided, the `withdrawBalance` function transfers Ether using a low-level call (`msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""")`) before updating the user's balance in the mapping `userBalances`. This allows an attacker to re-enter the contract and call `withdrawBalance` multiple times before the original execution is complete, potentially draining the contract's funds. Reentrancy attacks take advantage of this behavior by repeatedly calling back into the vulnerable contract before it has a chance to update the internal state.",2543,141,2.529309034347534
127,time manipulation,"YES

The vulnerability in the provided smart contract code lies in the use of `block.timestamp` within the `isSaleFinished()` function. As previously mentioned, `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by the miner to some extent. In this context, relying on `block.timestamp` to determine if a sale is finished makes the contract vulnerable to time manipulation. This could result in incorrect sale status evaluations, allowing miners to influence the timing of when the sale is considered finished.",2452,94,2.1196367740631104
128,time manipulation,"YES

The code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability arises from the reliance on `block.timestamp` or `now` for determining critical contract functionality. 

1. **Line 87**: The condition `if (rand > 0 && now - rand > 24 hours)` uses `now`, an alias for `block.timestamp`, which can be manipulated by miners. This allows a miner to affect the outcome of this condition to control when payouts occur, potentially leading to unfair advantages or exploitation of the contract.

2. **Line 99**: The function `randomGen()` returns `block.timestamp` as a source of randomness. However, `block.timestamp` is not a secure source of randomness because it can be influenced within a certain range by miners, leading to predictable behavior and possible exploitation.

These reliance points on `block.timestamp` make the contract susceptible to manipulation by miners, particularly in scenarios where timing is critical to the functionality of the contract.",2686,193,2.7042365074157715
129,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to timestamp manipulation. The vulnerability arises from the use of `block.timestamp` in the `resetInvestment` function. Since miners can manipulate the block timestamp slightly, they could potentially manipulate the timing conditions in the `resetInvestment` function to their advantage by making transactions at times that ensure the condition `block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp + ONE_MINUTE` is not met, allowing them to predictably influence when funds can be withdrawn.",2854,93,2.003376007080078
130,time manipulation,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable to time manipulation. The function relies on the `now` (current block timestamp) to determine whether to allow a transaction, as seen in the line `require(now != pastBlockTime);` and assigning `pastBlockTime = now;`. Since miners have control over the block timestamp to some degree, they can manipulate the execution of the contract to their advantage, particularly in relation to `if(now % 15 == 0)`, potentially allowing them to predictably win and drain the contract's balance.",2554,109,2.656752824783325
131,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of the block timestamp to generate randomness in the function `play()`. The line `var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;` uses `block.timestamp` to influence the outcome of the lottery game. Since miners can manipulate the timestamp to a certain degree, they could potentially exploit this to their advantage, allowing them to predict or manipulate the lottery result. This constitutes a vulnerability due to reliance on block timestamp for randomness.",2664,103,2.147582530975342
132,short addresses,"YES, the smart contract code is vulnerable to a short address attack. 

The vulnerability lies in the `sendCoin` function of the `MyToken` contract. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can accept transactions with incorrectly padded arguments, which can exploit poorly coded clients that encode arguments incorrectly. An attacker could craft a transaction with a specially crafted address that, when processed, would shift the encoding of the subsequent arguments. This can lead to values being interpreted incorrectly, such as transferring incorrect amounts or sending to unintended addresses. Ideally, this issue should be addressed at the client level where transaction encoding takes place. However, to mitigate the risk, contract developers can include checks for argument lengths to ensure they are as expected.",2711,144,2.451775074005127
133,denial of service,"YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The `emptyCreditors` function within the `DosGas` contract can lead to a denial of service because it attempts to clear an array (`creditorAddresses`) when its length exceeds 1500, which may require a significant amount of gas. If the array becomes too large before this function is executed, the operation to allocate a new array and set the length to zero might exceed the block gas limit, resulting in the function never being executed successfully. This effectively locks the contract from ever achieving the condition to set `win` to `true`, creating a denial of service scenario.",2679,133,2.436600923538208
134,denial of service,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to the inefficient way it manages the dynamic array in the `insertNnumbers` function. When a large number of elements are inserted, the array may grow indefinitely, causing the function to consume an excessive amount of gas, potentially leading to a scenario where transactions that call this function can no longer be executed within the block gas limit. This effectively renders the contract unusable for inserting more numbers, fulfilling the criteria of a DoS attack. Additionally, there is no cap on the number of elements that can be added, which exacerbates the issue by allowing the potential for intentional abuse to cause service denial.",2779,138,2.35560941696167
135,denial of service,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. In the `lendGovernmentMoney` function, the following operations can lead to such a vulnerability:

- The lines `creditorAddresses[creditorAddresses.length - 1].send(profitFromCrash);` and `msg.sender.send(amount);` use the `.send` function without properly handling the potential failure of ether transfer. If a transfer fails, the whole transaction will be reverted, which can be abused by a creditor address that is unable to receive funds (for example, a smart contract that rejects incoming ether).

- The reset of `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` to new empty arrays at lines `creditorAddresses = new address[](0);` and `creditorAmounts = new uint[](0);` can be manipulated to prevent the system from correctly tracking creditors and their amounts, potentially freezing operations associated with payouts and resets.

These issues can be used strategically by malicious actors to disrupt and deny service of the expected operations of the contract.",3753,212,3.1312217712402344
136,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability in this smart contract arises from the use of a `for` loop to iterate over the `refundAddresses` array and making a call to the `send` function for each address in the array (specifically in the `refundAll` function). The `send` function in Solidity sends Ether and returns false if the operation fails. However, in this design, the use of `require` with `send` means that if a single transaction to one of the addresses fails (i.e., if it returns false), it will cause the entire loop to revert and stop the refund process. This vulnerability can be exploited by having an address in the `refundAddresses` array with a contract that intentionally has a `fallback` or `receive` function that consumes more than the 2300 gas provided by `send`, causing `send` to fail. As a result, no further refunds can be processed, effectively causing a denial of service (DoS) where the refunding mechanism of the contract can be halted by a single address.",2662,211,2.9584133625030518
137,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in the ""DosOneFunc"" part of the code lies in the function `ifillArray`, specifically in the loop `for(uint i=0;i<350;i++)`. This loop iteratively pushes the sender's address into the `listAddresses` array. If the process of filling this array (executing the loop 350 times per call) reaches the point where it consumes more gas than the block gas limit allows, future attempts to clear or manipulate `listAddresses` (especially resetting it when `listAddresses.length` reaches 1500) might fail due to out-of-gas errors. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) as this function becomes unexecutable, trapping the contract's state and potentially affecting other functionalities that depend on this operation.",2556,167,2.868156909942627
138,denial of service,"YES

The smart contract contains a similar vulnerability as the original code in the `bid` function, which can lead to a denial of service. The vulnerability is due to the use of `currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid);`. If the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract with a fallback function that consumes more than the allotted gas stipend (2300 gas), the transaction will fail, preventing any further bids. This can be exploited by an attacker to block the auction and deny service to other participants.",2550,105,2.052419662475586
