The `withdrawBalance` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unrestricted External Calls:** The `withdrawBalance` function allows external calls to the contract before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `withdrawBalance` multiple times within a short period, potentially draining the contract's funds. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The code lacks any safeguards to prevent multiple calls to `withdrawBalance` from a single address.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `if` statement allows the contract to call an external contract (`msg.sender.call.value(_am)`) before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:** This creates a window for an attacker to call the `Collect` function again and again, draining the contract's funds.

The code you provided has a vulnerability related to the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays.  These arrays are initialized with a size of 0, which means that they can be manipulated to cause denial of service. 

Here's why:

* **Potential for Manipulation:**  The `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays are directly manipulated by the contract's logic. 
* **Zero-Size Arrays:**  The arrays are initialized with a size of 0. This means that they can be manipulated to cause denial of service.
