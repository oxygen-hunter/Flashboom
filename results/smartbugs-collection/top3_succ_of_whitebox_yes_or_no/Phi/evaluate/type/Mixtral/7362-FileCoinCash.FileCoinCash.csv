The Wallet contract is not vulnerable based on the provided code. The access control condition in line 27, ""require(0 <= bonusCodes.length)"", is not always true as the array length is signed. This condition is used to prevent array index out of bounds errors. Since the array is initialized with a length of 0, this condition will pass when a bonus code is added to the array, but it will fail when trying to pop or update a bonus code that does not exist.

22,access control," The given smart contract code consists of multiple contracts: Wallet, SafeMath, BasicToken, StandardToken, and FileCoinCash. I will focus on the Wallet contract for the audit.

YES, the Wallet contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the withdraw function. The require statement checks if the amount to be withdrawn is less than or equal to the balance of the sender. However, it does not check if the sender is the contract creator. This means that any address can call the withdraw function and transfer the contract's balance to their own address if they have enough Ether to pay for the gas fees.

The migrateTo function also has a similar issue. It checks if the creator is the msg.sender, but it does not check if the msg.sender is an allowed address. This means that anyone can call the migrateTo function and transfer the contract's balance to their own address if they have the contract's address and enough Ether to pay for the gas fees.

It's better to use a more secure method to assign token balances, such as using a predefined value or a function call to set the initial balances.",time manipulation,3.0,633.0,6.0,1.2186150550842285
131,time manipulation," YES, The vulnerability lies in the use of block.timestamp in the generation of a random number in the EtherLotto contract. This can be manipulated by miners, allowing them to potentially win the lottery multiple times or prevent others from winning.",time manipulation,3.0,576.0,6.0,0.9765353202819824
132,short addresses," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to short address attacks as the function sendCoin takes two arguments, an address and a uint256 amount, and there is no evidence of the use of short addresses in the code provided.",short addresses,1.0,574.0,6.0,0.8109405040740967
133,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to denial of service attacks based on the provided code snippet. The vulnerability in the previous code was due to the length of the array being checked against a hardcoded value, allowing an attacker to empty the array and deny service to other users. However, in this code, there is no such vulnerability present. The use of the SafeMath library and the proper handling of array lengths in the functions ensure that the contract is not vulnerable to denial of service attacks.",denial of service,1.0,629.0,6.0,1.0535221099853516
134,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to denial of service attacks based on the provided code snippet. The vulnerability in the previous code was due to the unchecked array length and the ability to add an arbitrary number of elements to the array. However, in the given code, the array is initialized as a part of the contract creation and its length is not changeable. Therefore, there is no vulnerability to denial of service attacks in the given code.",denial of service,1.0,619.0,6.0,1.4873671531677246
135,denial of service," YES, The vulnerability lies in the lines where `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays are being reset to empty arrays. This can be exploited to cause a denial of service by repeatedly calling the `lendGovernmentMoney` function and causing the contract to continuously reset these arrays, preventing new lenders from being added and causing the contract to become unresponsive.",denial of service,3.0,603.0,6.0,1.1696891784667969
136,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to denial of service attacks as described in the previous example. The vulnerability in the previous example was that the contract's funds were held up if a single send transaction failed. In this code, the contract ""FileCoinCash"" is not vulnerable to such an attack as it does not have a similar vulnerability in its ""refundAll"" function.",denial of service,1.0,606.0,6.0,1.0072622299194336
137,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to denial of service attacks as described in the previous example. The vulnerability in the previous example was that the contract allowed any address to add addresses to an array, which could be used to fill up the array and prevent other addresses from using the contract. In this example, the contract ""FileCoinCash"" does not have such a vulnerability. Instead, it initializes the array ""listAddresses"" in the constructor with two predefined addresses and sets the length to 1500, which is a constant value. Therefore, there is no vulnerability to denial of service attacks in this contract.",denial of service,1.0,653.0,6.0,0.9624388217926025
138,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not directly vulnerable to denial of service attacks as described in the previous example. However, it does have other potential vulnerabilities, such as the lack of access control checks in the FileCoinCash constructor, which could allow for potential over-issuance of tokens. Additionally, the use of the'send' function in the DosAuction contract, while not directly related to denial of service attacks, can still lead to potential vulnerabilities if not used carefully. It's always important to thoroughly test and audit smart contracts to ensure their security and reliability.",denial of service,2.0,641.0,6.0,1.0938999652862549
