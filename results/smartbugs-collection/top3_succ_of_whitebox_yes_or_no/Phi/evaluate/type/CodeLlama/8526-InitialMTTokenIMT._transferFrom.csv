The vulnerability lies in the use of the low-level `send()` function in the `sendToWinner()` and `withdrawLeftOver()` functions.

The `send()` function can fail if the recipient address is not valid or if the contract does not have enough balance to cover the transfer. If the `send()` function fails, the contract will continue to execute the remaining code, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Therefore, it is important to check the return value of the `send()` function to ensure that the transfer was successful. This can be done by using the `require()` function to check the return value of the `send()` function. For example, the `sendToWinner()` function can be modified to check the return value of the `send()` function as follows:
```
function sendToWinner() public {
    require(!payedOut);
    require(winner.send(winAmount));
    payedOut = true;

To fix this vulnerability, the `add` function should use the `SafeMath` library to perform arithmetic operations, which includes overflow checks. The `SafeMath` library provides a set of functions that perform arithmetic operations in a way that is safe for use in smart contracts, including overflow checks.

The vulnerability lies in the `mul` function in the `SafeMath` library, which can overflow or underflow when multiplying two large numbers. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the contract failing to execute or the balance of a user being set to a value that is not intended.

For example, if the `mul` function is used to multiply two large numbers, the result may overflow and cause the contract to fail. Similarly, if the `sub` function is used to subtract two large numbers, the result may underflow and cause the contract to fail.

This line is vulnerable because it does not check for overflows. If the value being added to the balance is greater than the maximum uint256 value, it will cause an overflow and the contract will not function correctly.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should check for overflows before performing the addition. One way to do this is to use the SafeMath library, which provides functions for safe arithmetic operations.

Here is an example of how the code could be modified to check for overflows:
