119,reentrancy," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The vulnerability lies in the CashOut function where the contract calls an external contract (msg.sender.call) before updating the contract state (balances[msg.sender]-=_am).

123,reentrancy," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The vulnerability lies in the line where the contract calls an external contract's function and waits for its result using the `()` call. This allows the external contract to call other functions or change the state of the contract before the result is returned, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities. In the given example, an attacker could drain the contract of funds by repeatedly calling the `Collect` function while the `Put` function is still being executed.",reentrancy,3.0,629.0,6.0,0.7485082149505615

127,time manipulation," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `isSaleFinished()` function, where the contract checks if the current block timestamp is greater than or equal to a specific value.

128,time manipulation," The given smart contract code is using the `block.timestamp` value to generate random numbers, but it is not checking if the contract's caller is the miner, so it is vulnerable to time manipulation attacks. Therefore, the answer is 'YES'. The vulnerability lies in the `randomGen()` function and the `payOut()` function where the `block.timestamp` value is used to generate random numbers and to check the time condition, respectively.",time manipulation,3.0,617.0,6.0,0.5891151428222656
129,time manipulation," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to time manipulation in the same way as the previous contract was. The vulnerability in the previous contract was that the contract relied on the block timestamp, which can be manipulated by miners. In contrast, the current contract uses a custom date conversion function to calculate timestamps, which is not vulnerable to time manipulation in the same way.

However, it's important to note that the current contract's date conversion function may still have other vulnerabilities or issues, such as potential integer overflows or underflows, or incorrect handling of leap years. These issues should be carefully evaluated to ensure the contract's security and reliability.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO', but with the caveat that the contract's date conversion function should be carefully evaluated for other potential vulnerabilities or issues.",time manipulation,2.0,686.0,6.0,0.7431297302246094
130,time manipulation," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable based on the provided code alone.

131,time manipulation," The second contract code is less vulnerable compared to the first one. The reason being, the second contract uses a custom function `toTimestamp()` to calculate the timestamp based on year, month, and day, instead of relying on `block.timestamp`. This approach is more secure as it eliminates the dependency on the miner's reported time. However, it's important to note that the second contract still has other potential vulnerabilities, such as the lack of access control and the absence of a limit on the number of tickets that can be bought. These issues should be addressed to ensure the contract's security.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO', but with the understanding that there are still other potential vulnerabilities in the contract that need to be addressed.",time manipulation,2.0,674.0,6.0,0.5984830856323242
132,short addresses," The given smart contract code does not appear to be vulnerable to short address attacks as the function sendCoin does not accept an address as an argument without checking its length. However, the code contains other potential vulnerabilities, such as the lack of input validation in the toTimestamp function, which could lead to integer overflows or underflows. Additionally, the use of the GMT\_TO\_LOCAL constant could potentially introduce a time dependency vulnerability if the contract relies on the current time for critical functionality.

136,denial of service," NO.

The given contract does not have any apparent denial of service vulnerabilities. The `toTimestamp` function calculates the Unix timestamp for a given date, and the `isLeapYear` function checks whether a given year is a leap year or not. The contract constructor initializes an array of refund addresses and a mapping of refund amounts. The `refundAll` function sends the refunds to all the refund addresses.

However, there are some potential issues with the contract:

1. The contract uses the Solidity version 0.4.24, which is quite old and has known vulnerabilities. It is recommended to use a more recent version of Solidity.
2. The contract does not check the return value of the `send` function, which can lead to the contract continuing execution even if the transaction fails.
3. The contract does not include any access control mechanisms, so any address can call the `refundAll` function and drain the contract of funds.
4. The contract does not include any checks on the input parameters of the `toTimestamp` function, so a user could potentially pass invalid dates to the function.

These issues are not directly related to denial of service vulnerabilities but should be addressed to improve the contract's security.",denial of service,2.0,774.0,6.0,0.6370935440063477
137,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to denial of service attacks based on the provided code. The vulnerability in the previous code was due to the unchecked loop that allowed pushing multiple addresses to the array in one transaction, potentially consuming all available gas and causing a denial of service. However, in the given code, the loop is limited to 350 iterations, which is a safe upper limit and does not pose a denial of service risk.",denial of service,3.0,617.0,6.0,0.6130378246307373
138,denial of service," The given smart contract code does not appear to be vulnerable to denial of service attacks based on the provided code.
