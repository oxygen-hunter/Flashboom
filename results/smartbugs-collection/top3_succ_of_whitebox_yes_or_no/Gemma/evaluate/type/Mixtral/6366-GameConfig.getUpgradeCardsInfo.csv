121,reentrancy," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The vulnerability in the provided code is not present. The `Collect` function in the `PRIVATE_ETH_CELL` contract does not allow external contract calls to be made before the initial execution is complete. Therefore, the state of the contract does not change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract.",reentrancy,1.0,611.0,6.0,0.890587329864502
122,reentrancy," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks based on the provided code snippet. The vulnerability in the original code was due to the use of the `.call.value()` function, which allows the contract to continue executing after the called contract's function has been executed. However, in the given code, there is no such usage of the `.call.value()` function.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",reentrancy,1.0,615.0,6.0,0.8338296413421631
123,reentrancy," The given smart contract code does not appear to be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks based on the provided code snippet. The vulnerability in the original code was due to the use of the `.call.value()` function, which allows the contract to continue executing after the called contract's function has finished executing. In the given code, there is no such usage of the `.call.value()` function.

However, it's important to note that this analysis is based on the provided code snippet alone and does not take into account the entire contract or any external contracts that it interacts with. It's always recommended to thoroughly analyze the entire contract and its interactions with other contracts to ensure security.",reentrancy,1.0,661.0,6.0,0.8288424015045166
124,reentrancy," Based on the given code, the `PrivateBank` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The vulnerability lies in the `CashOut` function, specifically the line where the contract calls the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. This allows the attacker to call external contracts and reenter the `CashOut` function before the initial execution is complete, draining the contract of funds.",reentrancy,3.0,609.0,6.0,1.7303638458251953
125,reentrancy," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The vulnerability in the provided code is not present. The `Collect` function in the `BANK_SAFE` contract does not allow the contract state to be changed in the middle of its execution due to an external call. The call to `msg.sender.call.value(_am)` is used to transfer ether to an external contract, but it does not affect the state of the `BANK_SAFE` contract. Therefore, there is no risk of reentrancy attacks in this code.",reentrancy,1.0,638.0,6.0,0.820244312286377
126,reentrancy," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The `withdrawBalance` function in the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract is similar to the vulnerable one you provided earlier, but the key difference is that the `withdrawBalance` function in the given code does not modify the contract state until after the external call has completed. Therefore, the contract state is not susceptible to being changed in the middle of the function's execution.

The `getUpgradeCardsInfo` function and the other elements in the `GameConfig` contract are not related to the vulnerability issue.",reentrancy,1.0,647.0,6.0,0.8635954856872559

128,time manipulation," The given smart contract code does not appear to be vulnerable to time manipulation based on the provided code snippet. The `randomGen` function returns the block timestamp, but it is not used in a critical way that could be exploited by an attacker. The vulnerability in the original `lottopollo` contract lies in the use of `now - rand > 24 hours` in the `payOut` function, which relies on the correctness of the block timestamp. In the given code, the `GameConfig` contract and its `getUpgradeCardsInfo` function are not related to the vulnerability in the original `lottopollo` contract.",time manipulation,1.0,659.0,6.0,0.8070993423461914
129,time manipulation," The given smart contract code does not appear to be vulnerable to time manipulation based on the provided code snippet. The vulnerability in the previous code was due to the use of `block.timestamp` to check the time elapsed before allowing a reset, which can be manipulated by miners. In the current code, there is no such use of `block.timestamp` that could lead to a vulnerability.",time manipulation,1.0,605.0,6.0,0.8125996589660645
130,time manipulation," The given smart contract code does not appear to be vulnerable to time manipulation based on the provided code snippet. The `require(now!= pastBlockTime)` statement in the constructor is not related to the `getUpgradeCardsInfo` function or the `UpgradeCard` struct, and the `pastBlockTime` variable is only used in the constructor to prevent multiple transactions per block. Therefore, the vulnerability in the original code snippet does not exist in this code.",time manipulation,1.0,620.0,6.0,0.7956397533416748
131,time manipulation," The given smart contract code does not appear to be vulnerable to time manipulation based on the provided code snippet.
