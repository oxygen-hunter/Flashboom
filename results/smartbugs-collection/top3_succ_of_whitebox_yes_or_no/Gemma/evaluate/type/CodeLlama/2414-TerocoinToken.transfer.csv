122,reentrancy,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack.

The `transfer` function uses the `SafeMath` library to handle safe arithmetic, which prevents reentrancy attacks. The `SafeMath` library provides functions for safe addition and subtraction, which are used in the `transfer` function to calculate fees and update balances. The `Transfer` event is also triggered, which ensures that the transfer is properly recorded.

The `transfer` function uses the `SafeMath` library to handle safe arithmetic operations, which ensures that the function is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. Additionally, the function uses the `onlyOwner` modifier to ensure that only the owner can call the function, which further reduces the risk of reentrancy attacks.",reentrancy,1.0,609.0,6.0,0.8100664615631104
125,reentrancy,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `transfer` function, where it calls the `calculateFee` function, which in turn calls the `sub` function from the `SafeMath` library. This allows the `transfer` function to make a new call to the `sub` function before the initial execution is complete, which can lead to a reentrancy attack.

The `calculateFee` function is called with the `_value` parameter, which is the amount of tokens being transferred. The `sub` function is called with the `_value` parameter and the `_fee` parameter, which is the fee amount. The `sub` function returns the difference between the two parameters, which is the amount of tokens being transferred minus the fee amount.

However, the `sub` function is called before the initial execution is complete, which means that the `_value` parameter is not yet set. This can lead to a reentrancy attack, where the `sub` function is called again with the `_value` parameter, which can cause the contract to run out of gas and fail.

To fix this vulnerability, the `calculateFee` function should be modified to use the `SafeMath.sub` function instead of calling the `sub` function directly. This will ensure that the `calculateF",reentrancy,3.0,803.0,6.0,1.0233049392700195
126,reentrancy,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `transfer` function, where the `calculateFee` function is called to calculate the fees. The `calculateFee` function uses the `SafeMath` library to perform safe arithmetic operations. However, the `calculateFee` function calls the `transfer` function again, which can lead to a reentrancy attack.

The `transfer` function can be called multiple times by an attacker, causing the contract to run out of gas and fail. This can lead to a denial-of-service attack, where the contract is unable to process transactions, and the attacker can drain the contract of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `calculateFee` function should not call the `transfer` function again. Instead, it should calculate the fees without calling the `transfer` function. This can be done by using a separate function to calculate the fees, and then calling the `transfer` function once with the calculated fees.",reentrancy,3.0,732.0,6.0,1.093855619430542

The code uses the `SafeMath` library to perform safe arithmetic operations, and it does not rely on the `block.timestamp` for any critical functionality. The `transfer` function calculates fees using the `calculateFee` function, which takes the loan amount, interest numerator, and interest denominator as inputs. The function returns the calculated fee, which is then added to the `_feeWallet` address and subtracted from the `_to` address.
