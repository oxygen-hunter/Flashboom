This function allows any external address to become an owner by simply executing this function, without proper verification or restriction. An attacker could exploit this by executing the `newOwner` function for their own address, gaining the ability to control the contract and perform restricted actions reserved for owners, such as withdrawing funds through the `withdrawAll` function in the `TestContract`. This lack of access control in adding new owners is a significant security risk.",1449,109,2.105597972869873
12,access control,"YES

The code is vulnerable due to improper access control. The constructor function `missing()` is defined with a public visibility, allowing anyone to call it and set themselves as the owner of the contract. This effectively means the contract has no access restrictions on who can set the owner, leading to potential access control exploits where an attacker could usurp ownership and subsequently withdraw contract funds via the `withdraw()` function marked with the `onlyowner` modifier.

However, due to a historical bug, if the contract name is changed (as in the infamous Rubixi rebranding), the constructor could be called as a regular function, allowing any arbitrary address to be set as the `creator`, bypassing access control and making the `onlyowner` modifier ineffective.

The current condition incorrectly checks if the amount is greater than or equal to the balance, which would always fail, preventing any legitimate withdrawals. This error doesn't directly indicate an access control issue but rather a logic mistake. Additionally, the `migrateTo` function relies on the creator address, which should be protected appropriately to prevent unauthorized users from transferring the balance.

The vulnerability lies in the design of the constructor function, which is incorrectly named `IamMissing` instead of being named after the contract `Missing`. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, the constructor should have the same name as the contract itself. Because of this naming mistake, the `IamMissing` function is a regular public function rather than a constructor. 

This allows anyone to call `IamMissing` after the contract is deployed, which sets the `owner` variable to the caller's address, effectively allowing anyone to take over the contract and subsequently withdraw its entire balance using the `withdraw` function.

The smart contract is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in an unsafe manner without proper access control checks. Specifically:

1. In the `withdraw` function, the line `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(fibSig, withdrawalCounter));` uses `delegatecall` to execute a function from the `fibonacciLibrary`. This allows the external library to modify the storage of the calling contract, which can be dangerous if the library's address is not controlled or verified.

2. The fallback function that also uses `delegatecall` exposes the contract to potentially malicious calldata. The line `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(msg.data));` can execute any function with any parameters on the library contract and modify the storage of the calling contract, again without any restriction on who can call it.

These use of `delegatecall` without proper access control or validation makes the contract susceptible to unauthorized manipulation and attacks, as any user can cause changes in the contract state by exploiting this feature.",1588,201,2.828529119491577

- `owner.send(balance);` in the `withdraw()` function

These calls can fail silently because they return a boolean indicating success or failure, but the return value is not checked.

30,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is due to the use of unchecked low-level calls using the `send` function. In Solidity, the `send` function only forwards 2300 gas to the recipient, making it potentially safer against reentrancy attacks because it limits what the recipient can do. However, `send` returns a boolean value indicating success, and if this is not checked, it can lead to unintended outcomes.

Lines in the contract where `send` is used without checking the return value:
- Line where `msg.sender.send(valuePaid)` refunds the value to the sender if they didn't pay enough to claim the throne.
- Line where `msg.sender.send(excessPaid)` returns excess funds to the sender.
- Line where `currentMonarch.etherAddress.send(compensation)` sends compensation to the previous monarch.
- Line where `wizardAddress.send(amount)` sends the specified amount to the wizard address in the `sweepCommission` function.

This unchecked use of `send` can result in the loss of funds if the send operation fails, as the failure would not revert the transaction or invoke any other error handling.

The vulnerability in this smart contract lies in the unchecked use of the low-level `send` function in two places:

1. In the `cash` function, the line `winner.send(subpot);` does not check the boolean return value of the `send` function, which can fail, leading to funds potentially not being transferred as intended without reverting the transaction.

2. In the fallback function, the line `msg.sender.send(msg.value-value);` similarly does not check if the `send` was successful, which can result in the refund operation failing silently.

Using `send` without checking its return value is considered unsafe because `send` can fail under certain conditions (e.g., if the receiving contract's fallback function runs out of gas), and failing to handle this correctly can leave the contract in an unintended state. It is recommended to use the `transfer` method or explicitly handle the return value when using `send` to ensure funds are transferred safely.",2892,195,3.531585693359375

57,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in the given smart contract code lies in the use of the low-level function `call` within the `proxy` function of the `Proxy` contract. The line:

uses the `call` function to call a function on the `target` address. This is a low-level call that does not bubble up errors and instead returns a boolean value indicating success or failure. The return value of the call is not checked in the code, which means if the call fails, the code will continue to execute without any indication of failure. This can lead to scenarios where the desired function call on the `target` address does not execute successfully, potentially leaving the contract in an unintended state or allowing for other unforeseen issues, such as unexpected loss of funds sent along with the call.

The smart contract is vulnerable to an arithmetic underflow in the `run` function. The `count` variable is decremented by `input`, and since `count` is an unsigned integer (`uint256`), if `input` is greater than `count`, it will cause an underflow. This will wrap the value of `count` to a large number, creating a vulnerability.

Since Solidity version 0.4.10 does not automatically prevent arithmetic overflows and underflows, adding the `_value` to `balanceOf[_to]` without any checks or safe arithmetic can result in an integer overflow if the sum exceeds the maximum value for a `uint256`. The result might be a wraparound to a value lower than expected, which could be exploited for financial gain by a malicious actor, allowing them to bypass intended balances limits and potentially steal funds.

The contract is vulnerable due to the use of an insecure randomness source. The `rand` function relies on the block hash of the previous block, which can be influenced by miners and is partially predictable. Since miners determine which transactions to include in the block and can control certain aspects of block creation, they can potentially manipulate the outcome of functions that rely on such ""random"" values, leading to predictable and exploitable results. This makes any logic that depends on this randomness potentially vulnerable to attacks.",3075,100,1.8926026821136475
94,bad randomness,"YES

The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in its use of block properties for determining randomness. Specifically, it uses the current block number to decide whether a bet is won: `bool won = (block.number % 2) == 0;`. This mechanism is weak because block numbers are predictable and can be influenced by miners. Miners may choose to only include transactions in blocks that favor them winning bets, thus exploiting this vulnerability.

The vulnerability in the smart contract code comes from its approach to generating randomness, which is not truly random and can be exploited. Specifically, the use of `keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now)` to initialize the `answer` variable is vulnerable. The block hash and timestamp (`now`) are predictable or manipulatable to some extent by miners or attackers observing the blockchain, making the outcome of the hash predictable.

The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in its approach to generating randomness within the `random` function. The implementation relies on predictable elements such as `block.timestamp`, `block.number`, and the `blockhash`, which can be influenced or predicted by miners or malicious actors. This predictability undermines the security of any operation that relies on this randomness, as attackers can potentially foresee the generated values and exploit this behavior to their advantage.

The smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The `Collect` function uses the low-level `call` method to transfer funds to `msg.sender` without updating the balance of the sender until after the call is made. This allows an attacker to re-enter the `Collect` function via a fallback function in a malicious contract and repeatedly withdraw funds before the balance is updated. A recommended approach to mitigate this would be to use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, where you update the balance of the sender before making external calls, or use safe withdrawal patterns.",1724,116,1.9487838745117188

To mitigate this, the contract should update the balance before making the external call.",1892,95,3.5701112747192383
106,reentrancy,"YES, the ACCURAL_DEPOSIT contract in the provided code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack due to the use of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` within the `Collect` function. This allows an attacker to create a malicious contract that recursively calls the `Collect` function before the transfer is complete and the state update (deducting the balance) is finalized, potentially draining the contract's funds. The vulnerability arises because the state update (`balances[msg.sender]-=_am;`) is done after the external call, allowing reentrant calls to exploit the contract state.",1852,117,2.085148334503174
107,reentrancy,"YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function of the `X_WALLET` contract, specifically at the line where `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` is used to send Ether to the caller.

109,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability arises from the `airDrop` function, which calls the `supportsToken` function defined in a potentially untrusted contract (`Bank` or `attack`). This external call is made without properly updating the internal state (specifically, it does not prevent subsequent reentrancy by updating `tokenBalance[msg.sender]` beforehand or using other protective measures like a re-entrancy guard). The `attack` contract specifically exploits this by calling `airDrop` again within its `supportsToken` implementation, allowing it to increase the token balance more than intended.",1503,127,2.275149345397949
110,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract code is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability is due to a reentrancy attack in the `CashOut` function. The contract uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` to send Ether to the caller, which is a low-level call that allows control to be transferred to the recipient's fallback function. This means the recipient contract could potentially make a recursive call back to the `CashOut` function before the execution of the current call is completed, leading to multiple withdrawals. The vulnerability occurs because the balance is updated after the call, allowing the attacker to drain funds from the contract by reentering it before their balance is reduced.",1674,132,2.3988046646118164
111,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability stems from the reentrancy issue present in the `Collect` function. The line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())` allows an external call to `msg.sender` before updating the contract's state (i.e., adjusting the `balances`). This setup permits a reentrancy attack, where an attacker can reenter the contract and call the `Collect` function again before the balance is updated, thereby draining the contract of its funds.",1848,102,1.951183795928955
112,reentrancy,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability in this code is due to a reentrancy attack vector present in the `withdrawAll` function. The line `bool callResult = msg.sender.call.value(oCredit)();` allows an external contract (the caller) to execute a fallback function before the state of the contract is updated (i.e., before `credit[msg.sender] = 0;` is executed).

113,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability exists in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `EtherBank` contract. Specifically, the order of operations is problematic:

1. The contract sends Ether to `msg.sender` using `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)()`.
2. However, this is done before setting the user's balance to zero.
3. This allows an attacker to re-enter the contract during the call and potentially withdraw more funds than they should, exploiting the lack of state update before the funds transfer.

This line makes an external call to `msg.sender` and sends ether to it, without updating the user's balance (`balances[msg.sender]-=_am;`) before the call. This is a classic reentrancy vulnerability, where `msg.sender` can be a contract that calls the `CashOut` function again before the state is updated, allowing it to withdraw more funds than it should be able to.

122,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. Similar to the explanation you provided for the original code, the vulnerability lies in the `CashOut` function where it uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`.

124,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability exists in the `CashOut` function, where the contract attempts to send Ether to the `msg.sender` by using `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. This pattern transfers control to the `msg.sender`, who can be an external contract that carries malicious intent. If this external contract has a fallback function that calls `CashOut` again before `balances[msg.sender]-=_am` is executed, it can recursively drain the contract of funds.

To mitigate this vulnerability, consider using the ""checks-effects-interactions"" pattern where the balance update effect is done before the external call, or utilize the `transfer()` or `send()` function of Solidity, which limits the gas forwarded and thus prevents reentrancy. Alternatively, consider using the `ReentrancyGuard` modifier from the OpenZeppelin library to make this function non-reentrant.",1614,186,3.0088047981262207

126,reentrancy,"YES, the contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function:

1. The contract transfers Ether with `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""")` before resetting the user's balance with `userBalances[msg.sender] = 0`.
2. This allows the caller's contract code to potentially execute its own logic after the Ether is transferred but before the user's balance is reset.

127,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` in the `isSaleFinished` function. The reliance on `block.timestamp` for determining whether a sale is finished makes the contract susceptible to time manipulation by miners, who have some leeway in adjusting the timestamp of a block. This can affect the outcome of time-dependent contracts, potentially allowing miners to influence when a sale is considered finished.",1134,87,1.5336873531341553
128,time manipulation,"YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in its reliance on the block timestamp for critical operations. Specifically, lines 13 and 27 introduce the vulnerability.

1. Line 13: `if ( rand> 0 && now - rand > 24 hours ) {` - This condition checks the difference between the current timestamp (`now`) and the random number generated (`rand`) to determine payouts. Because miners can manipulate block timestamps within a certain margin, this reliance on time for security-sensitive logic can be exploited.

2. Line 27: `return block.timestamp;` - Using `block.timestamp` for generating random numbers is insecure because the timestamp is not truly random and can be influenced by the miner. This can result in predictable ""random"" numbers, compromising the integrity of randomness in the contract.

Overall, the use of block timestamps for security-critical operations and randomness generation makes the contract vulnerable to time manipulation attacks.",1369,189,2.72031831741333
129,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` within the `resetInvestment` function to determine the timing for allowing a reset of the investment. Since `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners within a certain range, this can potentially be exploited. Miners can manipulate the block timestamp to make it appear as if more or less time has passed, which could lead to unintended behavior, such as triggering the `resetInvestment` function prematurely or delaying it. This time manipulation vulnerability could be used to exploit the contract's logic for resetting investments and redistributing funds.",1537,121,1.8940818309783936
130,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of the `now` keyword, which is an alias for `block.timestamp`, in lines 18 and 20 of the `Roulette` contract. This makes the contract susceptible to timestamp manipulation by miners. Miners can alter the `block.timestamp` slightly, which can be exploited to satisfy the condition `now % 15 == 0` and trigger the payout of the contract's balance to the attacker. The reliance on `block.timestamp` for determining critical functionality, such as winning the game, is insecure and should be avoided to prevent manipulation.",1236,125,2.143679618835449
131,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` as a source of randomness in the line:

```solidity
var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;
```

This approach to generating randomness is insecure because the block timestamp is controlled by miners, within certain limits. Miners can manipulate the timestamp to increase their chance of winning. This makes the randomness predictable and susceptible to manipulation, which can be exploited by an attacker. It is essential to use a more secure method to generate randomness in smart contracts.",1346,115,1.7969861030578613
132,short addresses,"YES, the presented contract code snippet is vulnerable to a short address attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `sendCoin` function of the `MyToken` contract. The function signature has two inputs: an address and a uint. If a user sends a transaction to this function with a short address, some clients may incorrectly pad the input data, leading to improper processing of the transaction arguments. This can allow an attacker to manipulate the transaction arguments, potentially causing unintended token transfers. The `sendCoin` function does not perform any checks that specifically handle or mitigate short address attacks, making it susceptible to this vulnerability.",1394,122,1.8908028602600098
133,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. 

The vulnerability stems from the `emptyCreditors` function. This function attempts to reset the `creditorAddresses` array to an empty state if its length exceeds 1500. However, as the array grows closer to this threshold, the gas required to execute the function also increases. Eventually, the gas cost may become too high for any transaction to successfully complete, effectively making the `emptyCreditors` function unusable. This is a typical denial of service situation due to exceeding the block gas limit, preventing any state changes and locking the `win` state to `false`.",1362,131,2.0957162380218506
134,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function within the `DosNumber` contract. The contract is susceptible to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to its inefficient array resizing mechanism. In the function, a for-loop runs `numbers` times, incrementally increasing the array's length by one for each loop iteration when `numElements` equals `array.length`. This operation can become gas-costly as the array size increases, potentially exceeding the block gas limit and causing the transaction to fail. This means users could be unable to add more numbers when the array gets too large, leading to a denial of service.",1462,136,2.1169581413269043
135,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is a Denial of Service (DoS) risk due to reliance on dynamic arrays for storing creditor addresses and amounts. If an address in `creditorAddresses` has a contract that refuses to accept Ether or has a fallback function with a high gas requirement, it could block the `lendGovernmentMoney` function when trying to send funds. This would prevent further creditors from being paid out, effectively freezing the contract and creating a Denial of Service situation. Additionally, line 46 `creditorAddresses = new address[](0);` and line 48 `creditorAmounts = new uint[](0);` may reset the arrays incorrectly in a situation where the current payout loop has not finished, leading to inconsistencies.",2436,154,2.4980533123016357
136,denial of service,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability is in the `refundAll` function, specifically in the line where it uses `require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));`. The use of `send` with `require` results in stopping the entire contractual process if any single address fails to receive funds (e.g., due to low gas limit or malicious refusal to accept funds). This leads to an overall denial of service since one failure in fund transfer will prevent all subsequent refunds from being processed.",1345,113,1.799285650253296
137,denial of service,"YES

The smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the `ifillArray` function. The nested for loop attempts to push the `msg.sender` address onto the `listAddresses` array 350 times each time the function is called. If the `listAddresses` array grows too large, it will result in consuming excessive gas, potentially hitting the block gas limit. This can prevent the completion of the transaction and make it difficult for the contract to function properly, as subsequent calls to this function may fail due to running out of gas, thereby denying service.",1239,118,1.8562238216400146
138,denial of service,"YES

The given smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. In the `bid` function, the line `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` is problematic. If the current frontrunner is a contract with a fallback function that consumes more than the allotted gas or if it is maliciously programmed to revert the transaction, the bid process will fail. This prevents any new bids from being accepted, effectively causing a denial of service against future bidders.",1232,96,1.7151923179626465
