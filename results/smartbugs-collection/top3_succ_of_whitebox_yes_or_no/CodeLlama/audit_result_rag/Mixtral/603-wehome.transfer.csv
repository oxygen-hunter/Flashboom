11,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue is with the `newOwner` function in the `MultiOwnable` contract. It allows any address to set a new owner for the contract as long as they are not the zero address. This means that an attacker can call this function and set themselves as the new owner, bypassing the intended access control. In the `TestContract` contract, the `withdrawAll` function is only marked as `onlyOwner`, but it does not check the new owner before transferring the funds, making it susceptible to this vulnerability.",944,122,4.856334686279297
12,access control," YES, the contract is vulnerable to access control issues. The `missing()` function sets the `owner` address to the `msg.sender` without any checks or restrictions, allowing any address to become the owner of the contract. This can lead to unintended consequences or malicious actions. The rest of the contract appears to have some access control checks, but the vulnerability in the `missing()` function can bypass those checks.",625,92,3.664639711380005
13,access control," YES, The contract's constructor function ""DynamicPyramid()"" sets the contract creator to be the msg.sender, which means anyone can call this function and become the contract creator. This bypasses the intended access control.",3208,50,3.317578077316284
14,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the lack of proper access control in the `withdraw` function in the original code. In the updated code, the `transfer` function has an additional check for the recipient's balance, which helps prevent overflows. However, the original `withdraw` function did not have this check, allowing an attacker to drain the contract if they had enough gas to repeatedly call the function and withdraw more than their balance.",821,96,3.836683988571167
15,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The `IamMissing` constructor function makes the `owner` address public, allowing any address to set the contract's owner during deployment. This means that the `withdraw` function can be called by any address that has interacted with the contract, potentially allowing unauthorized withdrawals.",639,68,2.751615285873413
16,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `withdraw` function only checks if the msg.sender is equal to the owner address, but it does not check if the msg.sender has any funds in the contract before executing the transfer. This means that any address can call the withdraw function and drain the contract of its funds.",729,81,3.248316764831543
17,access control," Yes, the Proxy contract is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the use of `delegatecall` in the `forward` function without proper validation of the callee's address or the data being passed. This can allow an attacker to call arbitrary functions on the contract or call external contracts, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities or loss of funds.

The transfer function in the given code is not directly related to the vulnerability in the Proxy contract. It appears to be a separate function with its own access control checks and is not using `delegatecall`. Therefore, it is not vulnerable based on the given code.",581,133,5.189021825790405
18,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the PopBonusCode function where the condition 0 <= bonusCodes.length is always true since array lengths are unsigned. This means that the PopBonusCode function can be called even if there are no bonus codes in the array, potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate the contract's state.",844,80,3.2393171787261963
19,access control," YES, the contract is vulnerable to access control issues. The constructor function in the contract sets the owner address, but it is not checked in the withdraw function. This means that anyone can call the withdraw function and drain the contract of funds if they manage to obtain the contract address. The onlyowner modifier is only applied to the withdraw function, but it should also be applied to the constructor function to ensure that only the initial owner can set the owner address.",628,94,3.7389132976531982
20,access control," YES, the initWallet function in the Wallet contract is vulnerable to access control attacks because the creator is set to msg.sender, allowing any caller to initialize the contract and become the creator. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as unauthorized access to the contract's functionality or state.",841,64,2.6274688243865967
21,access control," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the use of `tx.origin` to check the contract owner in the `sendTo` function. This can be bypassed by calling the function from a contract-owned account, allowing any address to call the `sendTo` function and transfer funds. The updated contract should use `msg.sender` instead of `tx.origin` to check the contract owner.",574,87,3.4510152339935303
22,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue is with the withdraw function in the Wallet contract. In the current implementation, anyone can call the withdraw function and transfer funds from the contract to their own address, regardless of whether they have the required balance or not. The require statement in the function only checks if the amount to be withdrawn is less than or equal to the current balance, but it does not check if the caller is the contract creator or the contract owner. Therefore, an attacker can call the withdraw function and drain the contract of funds. In the provided additional code, the transfer function seems to have the correct access control checks in place, but the Wallet contract itself still has the vulnerability.",875,146,5.7398681640625
23,access control," Yes, the SimpleSuicide contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is in the lack of access control for the `sudicideAnyone()` function, which allows any address to call it and self-destruct the contract, potentially losing all funds. In the provided second contract, the `transfer()` function includes checks to ensure the sender has sufficient funds and to prevent overflows, which mitigates the risk of access control vulnerabilities in that specific contract.",518,97,3.8370866775512695
24,access control," YES, the contract is vulnerable to access control attacks. The `changeOwner` function is marked as `public`, which means anyone can call it. However, it modifies the `owner` variable, which should only be modifiable by the contract creator. This allows any address to change the contract owner.",629,64,2.591791868209839
25,access control," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to access control attacks. The `withdrawAll` function only checks that the transaction origin is the contract owner, not that the transaction is coming from a contract-approved address. This means that anyone can call the `withdrawAll` function and transfer all the contract's funds to an attacker's address. The updated contract should use a more secure access control mechanism, such as an ERC-20 compliant `approve` and `transferFrom` functions, or a more complex multi-signature wallet.",606,117,4.579682350158691
26,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue lies in the use of `delegatecall` without proper checks on the returned data. In the `withdraw` and `fallback` functions, the contract calls the `FibonacciLib` contract using `delegatecall` without checking the returned data. This can allow an attacker to call arbitrary functions or modify the state of the `FibonacciLib` contract, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities or loss of funds.",1202,100,4.028096675872803
27,unchecked low level calls," YES, the contract is vulnerable due to the unchecked use of the low-level call `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)` in the `Command` function.

30,unchecked low level calls," YES

The vulnerability lies in lines 33-38 of the KingOfTheEtherThrone contract where the contract sends ether to addresses without checking for the success of the transaction.

31,unchecked low level calls," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of the low-level call function 'caddress.call' in the 'transfer' function without checking its return value. This can lead to fail-opens and other unwanted outcomes if the call fails. In the updated contract code provided, the vulnerability is not present as the 'transfer' function uses the high-level'send' function instead, which has built-in error handling and will revert the transaction if it fails.",682,105,4.146713733673096
32,unchecked low level calls," YES, the contract is vulnerable due to the unchecked use of the low-level send() function in the cash() function.

39,unchecked low level calls," YES, the code is vulnerable due to the unchecked low-level calls to the `extra` mappings. The `call()` function does not throw an error if the call fails, so if the called contract does not have enough funds or if the call encounters an error, the execution will continue and the `fundPuppets()` function will not be aware of the failure. This can lead to the contract continuing to transfer funds to empty or incorrect addresses, potentially draining the contract's funds.",2619,107,4.518972396850586

82,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the buy function where the contract does not check for arithmetic overflows before updating the balance. This can allow an attacker to buy more tokens than the contract has in total, leading to incorrect balances and potential loss of funds. In the sell function, there is a check for balanceOf[_to] + _value >= balanceOf[_to], which is supposed to prevent overflows, but it is not necessary since the contract already checks for sufficient balance in the require statement before the function is executed. However, in the buy function, there is no such check, making it vulnerable to arithmetic overflows.",910,143,5.617474794387817
83,arithmetic," YES, the original smart contract code is vulnerable to arithmetic overflows in the `run` function. The vulnerability is that the `count` variable is an unsigned integer, and subtracting a value from it that is greater than its current value will result in an overflow, which can lead to incorrect contract behavior or even security vulnerabilities.

The updated code with the `transfer` function added is not vulnerable to arithmetic overflows in the given context, as it includes checks to prevent overflows in the `transfer` function.

The vulnerability lies in the `isSaleFinished()` function, which relies on the `block.timestamp` value to determine if the sale is finished. An attacker can manipulate the reported time to make the sale finish earlier or later than intended. This can allow them to buy tokens at a discounted price or prevent others from buying them.

138,denial of service," NO. The given smart contract code does not appear to be vulnerable to denial of service attacks. The `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid))` statement in the original code is not present in the updated code. Instead, the contract uses a mapping to keep track of balances and includes a check to ensure that the sender has sufficient funds before making a transfer. This design mitigates the risk of denial of service attacks.",681,96,3.829988718032837
