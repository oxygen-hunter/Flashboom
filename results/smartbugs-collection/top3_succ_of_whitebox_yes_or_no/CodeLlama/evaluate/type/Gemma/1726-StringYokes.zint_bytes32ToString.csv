The `changeOwner` function is vulnerable to a potential reentrancy attack.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  The `changeOwner` function allows an attacker to call it repeatedly, potentially draining the contract's funds. 
* **Potential for Manipulation:**  The `changeOwner` function is directly accessible, and an attacker could exploit this to change the contract's owner.

The `withdraw` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Call:** The `withdraw` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_amount)()` which is an external call.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `withdraw` multiple times within a short period, potentially draining the contract's funds. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `withdraw` function doesn't handle the potential for multiple calls, making it susceptible to reentrancy.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `if` statement allows the contract to call an external contract (`msg.sender.call.value(_am)`) before the `acc.balance-=_am` operation is complete. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:** This creates a window for an attacker to call the `Collect` function multiple times, draining the contract's funds.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `Collect` function doesn't handle the external contract call's return value. This means an attacker could potentially call the `Collect` function multiple times in rapid succession, draining the contract's funds.

The contract uses the `supportsToken` function to check if the caller has the `Nu Token` contract. This function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:** The `supportsToken` function calls the `airDrop` function of the `ModifierEntrancy` contract.  
* **Potential for Reentrancy:** The `airDrop` function could be called again before the first call is complete, leading to a reentrancy attack. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `airDrop` function could be called multiple times, leading to an attacker draining the contract's funds.
