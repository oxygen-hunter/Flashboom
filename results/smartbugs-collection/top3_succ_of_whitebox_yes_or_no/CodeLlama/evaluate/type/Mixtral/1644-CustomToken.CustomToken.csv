123,reentrancy," YES, the contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The vulnerability lies in the line where `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` is executed within the Collect function. This line allows the contract to call an external contract and transfer funds before the state of the contract is updated, leaving the contract vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.",reentrancy,3.0,597.0,6.0,0.9555902481079102
124,reentrancy," YES, the vulnerability lies in the CashOut function's use of the msg.sender.call.value() function. This function allows the contract being called to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete, making it vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.",reentrancy,3.0,582.0,6.0,1.0256474018096924
125,reentrancy," YES, the contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The vulnerability lies in the line where `msg.sender.call.value(_am)` is executed inside the Collect function. This line allows the contract to call an external contract and transfer ether to it before the state change of the Collect function is finalized. An attacker can exploit this by calling the Collect function multiple times with smaller amounts, draining the contract of ether before the state change of the Collect function is finalized.",reentrancy,3.0,622.0,6.0,0.8120296001434326
126,reentrancy," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The `withdrawBalance()` function is not present in this contract. Therefore, there is no function call to an external contract that could allow for reentrancy attacks.",reentrancy,1.0,577.0,6.0,0.802743673324585
127,time manipulation," NO. The given smart contract code does not rely on the current time for critical functionality, so it is not vulnerable to time manipulation attacks.",time manipulation,1.0,557.0,6.0,0.7901461124420166
128,time manipulation," NO. The given smart contract code does not rely on the current time for critical functionality and does not use block.timestamp or its alias now in a way that can be exploited. The vulnerability in the previous code was related to the use of block.timestamp for generating random numbers, which is not present in this code.",time manipulation,1.0,591.0,6.0,1.0099267959594727
129,time manipulation," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the use of `block.timestamp` in the `resetInvestment()` function. The attacker can manipulate the timestamp to call the `resetInvestment()` function before the one-minute requirement is met.",time manipulation,3.0,575.0,6.0,0.832514762878418
130,time manipulation," NO. The given smart contract code does not have a vulnerability related to time manipulation. The vulnerability in the previous code was that the contract relied on the current block time to limit the number of transactions per block, but the block time can be manipulated by miners. However, in the given code, there is no such limitation based on the current block time.",time manipulation,1.0,600.0,6.0,0.795231819152832
131,time manipulation," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of block.timestamp to generate random numbers in the play() function. As explained earlier, the block timestamp can be manipulated by miners, and using it to generate random numbers can lead to predictable outcomes and potential attacks.",time manipulation,3.0,585.0,6.0,0.8215534687042236
132,short addresses," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to short address attacks as it does not contain any function that accepts an address as an argument without checking its length. However, it does have other issues. For instance, the constructor function ""CustomToken"" sets the initial total supply and assigns it to the address 0xae3d6f1346d4567fa3a84a371f934844059c683a, which is a non-standard 20-byte address. This address is then transferred the total supply of tokens. This is not a best practice and can lead to potential security issues. Additionally, the constructor function should be marked as ""payable"" if it is intended to receive ether during deployment. Overall, while the code is not vulnerable to short address attacks, it does have other issues that should be addressed.",short addresses,2.0,696.0,6.0,0.7924728393554688
133,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the previous code snippet. The provided code does not contain any function that could be used for a denial of service attack. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",denial of service,1.0,577.0,6.0,1.3306691646575928
134,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not directly vulnerable to denial of service attacks as it does not contain any function that allows for the insertion of large amounts of data or the manipulation of contract state in a way that could be exploited for a denial of service attack. However, the contract does contain a function called 'CustomToken' which initializes an ERC20 token with a pre-mined supply and assigns it to a specific address. This function does not have any access control mechanisms in place, so any user can call it and claim the pre-mined tokens. This is not a denial of service vulnerability, but it is a security vulnerability that could allow for the unintended distribution of tokens.",denial of service,2.0,665.0,6.0,0.8426833152770996
135,denial of service," The given smart contract code does not appear to be vulnerable to denial of service attacks based on the provided code. However, it is important to note that this analysis is based on the provided code alone and does not take into account any external dependencies or interactions with other contracts. Additionally, the code contains a separate contract definition for 'CustomToken' which is not related to the vulnerability analysis.",denial of service,1.0,607.0,6.0,0.7837798595428467
136,denial of service," NO. The given smart contract code does not have the same vulnerability as the previous one. The `CustomToken` constructor is not related to the `refundAll` function or the `refundAddresses` array. Therefore, there is no risk of a single failure causing all funds to be held up.",denial of service,1.0,590.0,6.0,0.8150913715362549
137,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not directly vulnerable to a denial of service attack as in the previous example. The vulnerability in the previous example was the unchecked array size limit and the ability to add addresses to the array indefinitely. In this contract, the array `listAddresses` is not used, and the function `ifillArray()` is not called anywhere in the contract. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack.

However, it is important to note that the contract does have other vulnerabilities. For instance, the `CustomToken()` constructor creates a new token with a total supply of 210 quintillion, assigns the entire supply to a single address, and then transfers the entire supply to that address. This is not a denial of service attack, but it is a significant security vulnerability that could allow an attacker to take control of the entire token supply. Additionally, the contract does not include any access control mechanisms, so any address can call the `ifillArray()` function and potentially fill the array with their address. This could lead to unintended consequences or denial of service for other users of the contract.",denial of service,2.0,754.0,6.0,0.8122389316558838
138,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the previous question. The code you provided is a simple ERC20 token contract and does not contain any functionality related to the DosAuction contract or denial of service vulnerabilities. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",denial of service,1.0,586.0,6.0,0.862799882888794
