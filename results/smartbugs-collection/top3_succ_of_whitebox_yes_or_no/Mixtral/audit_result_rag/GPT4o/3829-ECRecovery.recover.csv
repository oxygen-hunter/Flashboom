The vulnerability in the code is due to the unrestricted use of `delegatecall` at lines 31 and 38 in the `FibonacciBalance` contract. Using `delegatecall` allows the `FibonacciLib` contract's code to execute in the context of the `FibonacciBalance` contract with its storage, meaning that it can modify the state of the `FibonacciBalance` contract. Since `delegatecall` is used with user-supplied data (in the fallback function) or for critical operations (such as withdrawal amounts being calculated), it opens up the possibility for an attacker to manipulate the logic or state of the `FibonacciBalance` contract, potentially leading to unauthorized access or withdrawal of funds.

28,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of the `send` function for transferring Ether. The `send` function is a low-level call that only forwards 2300 gas by default, which might not be enough for the recipient to execute further operations if they have a fallback function. This restriction can cause a failure in the transfer, and if the return value is not checked, it can lead to an unexpected behavior where Ether is not transferred as intended. Specifically, the lines containing `owner2.send(sum2);` in the `tokens_buy` function and `owner.send(balance);` in the `withdraw` function do not check if the send operation was successful. If these send operations fail, the contract would still continue execution, potentially leading to loss of funds or a state that the contract owner might not expect.",1782,170,3.4302549362182617

30,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The vulnerability in the given smart contract lies in the use of the low-level `send` function, which is used at several points in the contract without checking its return value. The `send` function returns a boolean indicating success or failure, but if not checked, failures can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. Specifically, the contract might fail to update internal states appropriately if a `send` fails, as execution will continue regardless of success or failure. These instances are present in the lines where funds are sent back to the sender or to the current monarch:

1. Line 110: `msg.sender.send(valuePaid);`
2. Line 118: `msg.sender.send(excessPaid);`
3. Line 132: `currentMonarch.etherAddress.send(compensation);`
4. Line 174: `wizardAddress.send(amount);`

By not checking the return values of these calls, the contract could leave ether locked in the contract or allow reentrant attacks under certain conditions, if an attacker crafts a receiving contract to deliberately revert transactions. To mitigate this, consider using `transfer` or `call` methods with appropriate checks, or handle the possible failure of `send` appropriately.",2647,243,4.405970335006714

The problematic lines are:

1. `winner.send(subpot);` in the `cash` function.
2. `msg.sender.send(msg.value-value);` in the fallback function.

61,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability, as in the previous code, arises from the use of low-level calls (`call()`) without checking their return values. Specifically:

- Line with `firstTarget.call.value(msg.value)();` is vulnerable because it uses a low-level call to send Ether to `firstTarget` without verifying if the call was successful. This may lead to unintended behavior if the call fails.
- Line with `secondTarget.call.value(msg.value)();` has the same issue, potentially resulting in a silent failure since the return value is not checked.
- Line with `owner.call.value(1 wei)();` also poses a risk as it doesn't check if the call was successful. This could lead to failure in transferring even 1 wei and leave the contract in an unintended state.

73,front running,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is due to a potential front-running attack. In the `setReward` function, the reward is transferred to the owner before updating the contract's reward value. This creates an opportunity for an attacker to observe the transaction and front-run it with their transaction that can alter the state or claim the reward maliciously. Additionally, in the `claimReward` function, there is no proper mechanism to prevent front-running attacks to protect against someone claiming the reward by observing the transaction with a valid submission.

The vulnerability lies in the way the `approve` function is implemented. The `approve` function simply sets the allowance without considering the current approved value, which can lead to a race condition known as ""front-running"". In a scenario where a spender wants to change the allowance, an attacker could monitor the transaction and send a transaction to change the allowance before it is set by the original owner. This allows the attacker to potentially withdraw tokens without the owner's consent or knowledge. To mitigate this, it's recommended to implement the ""increaseAllowance"" and ""decreaseAllowance"" pattern or utilize the ERC20's `approve` function with a ""nonce"" or other modification to prevent setting an undesired allowance before increasing it.",2203,154,2.6009199619293213

1. **Block Hash Predictability:** A block hash is influenced by information from the previous block, which can be known or manipulated by miners. Since miners can control which transactions are included in a block and affect the state of the network, they can influence or predict this value.

2. **Timestamp Predictability:** The `now` variable, which is an alias for `block.timestamp`, can also be manipulated slightly by miners. While there are constraints on how much they can alter the timestamp, they can still adjust it within a certain range to their advantage.

The line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())` is using a low-level call to transfer Ether, which allows the possibility for a reentrancy attack. 

If a malicious contract is calling the `Collect` function, it can re-enter the function before the contract's state has been updated (i.e., before `acc.balance -= _am` is executed). By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can repeatedly withdraw funds, draining the contract's balance. To mitigate such vulnerabilities, it's advisable to update the contract's state before making external calls, or to use the `transfer` or `send` functions, which provide better security guarantees against reentrancy.",1613,177,6.112123250961304
98,reentrancy,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is due to the potential for a reentrancy attack in the `withdrawFunds` function. The problem is the use of `msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)()` on line 43, which attempts to send Ether to the caller before updating the balance and `lastWithdrawTime`. This allows an attacker, via a malicious contract, to call the `withdrawFunds` function recursively before the state changes (like reducing the balance and updating the withdrawal time) occur, enabling them to drain funds from the contract.

The vulnerability is present in the `Collect` function, where the contract sends Ether using `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. This pattern allows the `msg.sender` to execute fallback functions, which could be part of a malicious contract. If the attacker implements a fallback function that calls back into the `Collect` function, they can manipulate the contract state and drain funds by repeatedly executing the call before the balance is updated (i.e., `acc.balance -= _am;`). This issue can be mitigated by using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, where the state change (e.g., deducting the balance) is done before making an external call.",1779,148,3.1904263496398926

The vulnerability is due to a reentrancy attack potential in the `Collect` function, specifically at the line where `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` is used to send Ether. This line of code allows an external contract (the receiver of the Ether) to execute its fallback function. If the fallback function is designed to call back into the original contract's `Collect` function before the balance is updated, it can create a loop and drain funds from the contract.

108,reentrancy,"YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `WithdrawToHolder` function, specifically at the line `if(_addr.call.value(_wei)())`. This line uses a low-level call to send Ether to the `_addr` address. If `_addr` belongs to a smart contract, that contract can execute fallback functions which could potentially make further calls back into the `WithdrawToHolder` function before the state update with `Holders[_addr]-=_wei;` is completed. This could allow an attacker to repeatedly withdraw funds from the `TokenBank` contract.",1699,126,2.1660966873168945
109,reentrancy,"YES. 

The smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `airDrop` function and the way `supportsToken` modifier is structured. The `supportsToken` modifier checks if the calling contract supports the token by using the `Bank` contract's `supportsToken` function, which is the same external call that can be exploited by an attacker. In the `attack` contract, the `supportsToken` function is overridden to call the `airDrop` function again upon the first invocation, leveraging the reentrancy issue. This allows the attacker to execute multiple `airDrop` calls before the initial execution completes, draining tokens that are not meant to be allocated repeatedly to the same address.",1384,147,2.991501808166504
110,reentrancy,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability is present in the `CashOut` function on the line where `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` is used. This low-level call sends ether to `msg.sender` and allows `msg.sender` to call back into the `CashOut` function before the state update `balances[msg.sender] -= _am;` is executed. The caller can exploit this by repeatedly calling `CashOut` to drain the contract's balance.",1555,104,2.0795624256134033
111,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability exists in the `Collect` function of the `PERSONAL_BANK` contract. Specifically, the line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())` performs an external call to the caller (potentially a malicious contract) which can then re-enter the `Collect` function before the contract has updated the balance of the sender. This means that during this external call, a malicious contract can exploit this to repeatedly withdraw funds before the balance is correctly updated.",1729,107,2.1693789958953857
112,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawAll` function, where it uses `msg.sender.call.value(oCredit)()` to send funds to the caller before updating the caller's credit balance.

114,reentrancy,"YES

The given smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability is present in the `CashOut` function, specifically in the line where the contract uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. This external call hands over control to the `msg.sender` without updating the state first (i.e., reducing the sender's balance before making the external call). An attacker could exploit this by repeatedly invoking the `CashOut` function before the balance is updated, ultimately draining the contract of its funds.",1519,105,1.6954312324523926
115,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `CashOut` function, specifically at the line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())`. This call transfers Ether to an external address (the caller) and could allow a malicious contract to call back into the `CashOut` function before the original execution is completed, potentially depleting the contract's funds.

117,reentrancy,"YES

The contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The issue is in the `withdrawBalance` function, where it sends Ether to an external address (the caller) using `call.value(...)`. This call allows the caller's fallback function to execute before `userBalances[msg.sender]` is set to 0. If the caller is a malicious contract, it could use this opportunity to call `withdrawBalance` again before the balance is updated, allowing it to withdraw more Ether than intended.",1191,101,1.9875354766845703
118,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability is present in the `withdrawBalance` function. Specifically, the call to `msg.sender.call.value(userBalance[msg.sender])()` sends Ether to the caller but does not update the caller's balance to zero until after the call. This allows a malicious contract to repeatedly call the `withdrawBalance` function, re-entering the contract before the initial execution completes and draining funds.

This line uses a low-level call (`call.value`) to send Ether to `msg.sender` without updating the contract's state before the call. As a consequence, if `msg.sender` is a contract, it can implement a fallback function that calls `Collect` again before the state update `acc.balance -= _am;` is executed.

125,reentrancy,"YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability is found in the `Collect` function, specifically on line 54: `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())`. The contract sends Ether to the caller (msg.sender) before updating the caller's balance, which allows a malicious contract to call the `Collect` function again before the balance is updated, leading to draining the contract of its funds. This is a classic case of reentrancy where the internal state is not updated before making an external call, thus allowing an attacker to repeatedly exploit this condition.",1649,122,3.2443971633911133
126,reentrancy,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function, which allows a reentrancy attack.

127,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the use of `block.timestamp` in the `isSaleFinished` function. As explained earlier, `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners, which makes time-dependent logic like this unreliable. Relying on the block timestamp for critical functionality, such as determining whether a sale is finished, can lead to potential exploitation where a miner slightly adjusts the timestamp to favor certain transactions.",1015,89,1.6132824420928955
128,time manipulation,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable due to its reliance on the current time, which can be manipulated by miners. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the use of `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) in line 34 within the `payOut` function: 

```solidity
if ( rand > 0 && now - rand > 24 hours ) {
```

This line checks the condition based on the current block timestamp, which miners can manipulate within a certain range, potentially allowing them to exploit the contract to receive payouts unfairly. Additionally, the `randomGen` function returns the current block timestamp:

```solidity
function randomGen() constant returns (uint randomNumber) {
    return block.timestamp;   
}
```

This misuse of `block.timestamp` for randomness makes the generation of random numbers predictable and manipulable by miners, further exacerbating the security risk.",1250,179,3.1169228553771973
129,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is due to time manipulation. The contract uses `block.timestamp` to manage the timing of investments. Miners can manipulate this timestamp within a certain range, which can affect the behavior of the contract. Specifically, the `resetInvestment` function depends on the time elapsed since the last investment, allowing a malicious miner to potentially reset the investment prematurely or delay it to gain an advantage. This reliance on `block.timestamp` introduces a potential vulnerability as it can be influenced by miners, leading to unpredictable and exploitable contract behavior.",1418,115,1.9016311168670654
130,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in its reliance on the `now` variable, which is equivalent to `block.timestamp`. Miners have some control over the timestamp, allowing them to manipulate it within a certain range. Specifically, in the fallback function, the contract uses `now` to check the condition `now % 15 == 0`, which can be influenced by miners to make the contract transfer its entire balance. The condition `require(now != pastBlockTime)` is intended to ensure that only one transaction occurs per block, but it does not address the miner's ability to manipulate the block timestamp to exploit the contract.",1117,130,2.156503200531006
131,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability arises from using `block.timestamp` in the line that generates randomness: `var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;`. As explained, using `block.timestamp` allows miners some control over the execution context of transactions, as they can manipulate the timestamp within a certain range. This can be exploited to predict the result of the random number generation, making the contract susceptible to manipulation in favor of the attacker.",1227,97,1.5885517597198486
132,short addresses,"YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the short address attack. The vulnerability arises in the `sendCoin` function where it takes `address to` and `uint amount` as arguments. In Solidity version 0.4.11, there is no built-in protection against short address attacks, where transaction parameters can be incorrectly truncated if not properly validated. This can lead to incorrect execution of the function if transactions are crafted with insufficient padding in client-side applications.",1275,94,1.8114805221557617
133,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is due to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The function `emptyCreditors` relies on the `creditorAddresses` array length being greater than 1500 to reset it. If the array grows too large, calling functions that iterate over it, such as `numberCreditors`, could consume excessive gas, potentially leading to transaction failures due to gas limits. Additionally, adding too many entries via the `addCreditors` function can make it difficult to empty the array, as resetting large arrays involves significant gas costs. This could result in a 'denial of service' for any function depending on modifying or using this list, such as achieving the `win` state in the current design.",1243,154,3.267016649246216
134,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the following lines:

1. The loop `for(uint i=0;i<numbers;i++)` (line 18) can cause the function to consume an indefinitely high amount of gas if `numbers` is a large value.

2. The line `if(numElements == array.length) { array.length += 1; }` (lines 19-21) dynamically increases the array length, which can lead to high gas costs as it involves costly memory reallocation every time the condition is met.

These factors can cause the function to run out of gas and fail, rendering the smart contract unusable for subsequent transactions and effectively resulting in a DoS condition.",1343,166,3.0907084941864014
135,denial of service,"YES

This smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the lines where the arrays `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` are reset to new empty arrays during the handling of debt repayment in the function `lendGovernmentMoney`. Specifically, when the contract attempts to send funds to the last creditor using `creditorAddresses[creditorAddresses.length - 1].send(profitFromCrash)`, it's possible for a malicious actor to enter the contract as a creditor with a malicious fallback function that reverts the transaction.

This malicious fallback function would prevent the contract from executing further, effectively stopping any subsequent creditors from being paid out. Since the contract logic is reliant on successfully iterating through these creditors and paying them out, this denial of service prevents the completion of this loop, stopping the payout process and freezing the contract state in a particular round. Thus, any future creditors would also not receive their payout, which locks the contract in a ""frozen"" state.",2317,201,3.6979141235351562
136,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function, where it uses `require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));` to send refunds. If any address in the `refundAddresses` array does not accept the refund, possibly due to exceeding the gas limit of the `send` method, the entire `refundAll` function will fail. This means that a single failure can prevent all refunds from being processed, effectively resulting in a denial of service for the refund mechanism.",1226,115,1.9463720321655273
137,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability type is 'denial of service (DoS)' which is linked to the gas consumption. The function `ifillArray` contains a loop that pushes `msg.sender` into the `listAddresses` array up to 350 times per call. As the array grows larger, the operation will require progressively more gas, potentially reaching the block gas limit. When the gas required to execute this function exceeds the block gas limit, the function will fail to execute, causing a denial of service for any function dependent on `ifillArray`. This will effectively prevent any users from calling the function, hence leading to a denial of service situation.",1120,138,2.2336227893829346
138,denial of service,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to the same issue present in the `bid()` function. The line `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` can lead to a denial of service attack. If the current frontrunner is a contract with a fallback function that reverts or runs out of gas, the `send` operation will fail, and the `bid()` function will not be able to proceed, effectively preventing any new bids from being accepted and denying service to other users.",1113,101,2.2244837284088135
