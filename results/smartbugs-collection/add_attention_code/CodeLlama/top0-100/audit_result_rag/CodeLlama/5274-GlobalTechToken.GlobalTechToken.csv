72,unchecked low level calls,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of the `SafeMath` library, which is not used correctly in the `GlobalTechToken` contract. The `SafeMath` library provides a set of functions for performing arithmetic operations in a safe and secure manner, but the `GlobalTechToken` contract does not use it correctly.

In particular, the `sub` function in the `SafeMath` library is used to perform subtraction operations, but it does not handle underflows. In the `GlobalTechToken` contract, the `sub` function is used to subtract the amount of tokens to be transferred from the sender's balance, but if the sender's balance is less than the amount to be transferred, the function will not handle the underflow and will return a value that is less than zero. This can lead to a vulnerability, as the contract will not be able to handle the underflow and will not be able to transfer the tokens.

Additionally, the contract uses the `assert` statement to check the condition `b <= a` before subtracting `b` from `a`, which ensures that the subtraction is performed correctly.",995,83,4.381243705749512
134,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code uses the SafeMath library to perform arithmetic operations, which ensures that the contract is not vulnerable to arithmetic overflows and underflows. Additionally, the code uses the require() function to check the input values, which ensures that the contract is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.",1122,76,3.8726253509521484
135,denial of service,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable. The code uses the SafeMath library to perform arithmetic operations, which ensures that the contract is secure against arithmetic overflows and underflows. Additionally, the contract uses the modifier ""onlyOwner"" to restrict access to certain functions, which ensures that only the owner of the contract can perform certain actions.",2546,76,4.119933366775513
136,denial of service,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function, which uses the `require` statement to send Ether to multiple addresses. If any of the `send` calls fail, the entire function will fail and the remaining `send` calls will be blocked. This can cause the contract to become unresponsive and unable to process any further transactions, leading to a denial of service attack.",1022,101,5.230321884155273
137,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The code uses the SafeMath library to perform arithmetic operations, which ensures that the contract is secure against integer overflows and underflows. Additionally, the contract uses the `assert` statement to check the condition `b <= a` before subtracting `b` from `a`, which ensures that the subtraction is performed safely. Therefore, the contract is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack.",840,106,5.283318758010864
138,denial of service,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable. The code includes a library called SafeMath, which is a library that provides safe mathematical operations. The library includes a function called sub() that performs a safe subtraction. The function checks that the second argument is less than or equal to the first argument, and then subtracts the second argument from the first argument. This function is used in the bid() function to ensure that the current bid is greater than the previous bid. Therefore, this smart contract is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack.",830,116,5.783178091049194
