79,arithmetic,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflows and underflows. The vulnerability lies in the `add` function, where the `balance` variable is not properly checked for overflows.

The `add` function is used to add a deposit to the `balance` variable, but it does not check if the result of the addition will overflow. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the `balance` variable becoming negative or exceeding the maximum value of a uint256.

To fix this vulnerability, the `add` function should check if the result of the addition will overflow before assigning it to the `balance` variable. This can be done by using the `SafeMath` library, which provides functions for safe arithmetic operations.

Therefore, the `add` function should be modified to use the `SafeMath.add` function, like this:
```
function add(uint256 deposit) public {
    uint256 newBalance = SafeMath.add(balance, deposit);
    if (newBalance > balance) {
        balance = newBalance;
    } else {

    }
}

Moreover, the transfer function also uses the SafeMath library to perform arithmetic operations, but it does not check for overflows or underflows. This means that if the balance of the sender is less than the value being transferred, the SafeMath library will not detect the error and the contract will continue to execute the transfer function.
