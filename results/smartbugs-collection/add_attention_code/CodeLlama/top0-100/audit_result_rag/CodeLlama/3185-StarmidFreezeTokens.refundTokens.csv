The code is not vulnerable because it does not contain any access control issues. The `StarmidTransfer` contract is not used in the `StarmidFreezeTokens` contract, and the `refundTokens` function does not have any access control issues. The function only requires that the caller is the owner of the contract, which is verified using the `require` statement.

The `clearDOS` function also requires that the number of elements in the array is greater than 1500, which ensures that the function can only be called by the owner of the contract. The `getLengthArray` function returns the number of elements in the array, and the `getRealLengthArray` function returns the length of the array.
