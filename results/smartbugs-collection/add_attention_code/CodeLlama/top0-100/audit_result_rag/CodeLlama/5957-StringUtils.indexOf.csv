The reason for this vulnerability is that the contract does not have any access control mechanism in place, which means that anyone can call the ""missing"" function and change the owner's address. This can lead to a situation where an attacker can take control of the contract and execute malicious code.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should have a modifier that checks the caller's address and only allows the owner to call the ""missing"" function.",949,141,5.167227029800415
