72,unchecked low level calls,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the MultiTransfer contract, specifically in the transfer function. The function allows an attacker to transfer tokens from an owner's account to multiple recipients in a single transaction, which can lead to a reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the transferFrom function in the ERC20 contract is called multiple times in a loop, which can cause the contract to enter a reentrancy attack. This can allow an attacker to repeatedly call the transferFrom function and drain the contract of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the transfer function in the MultiTransfer contract should be modified to use the transfer function in the ERC20 contract only once, instead of multiple times in a loop. This can be done by using the transferFrom function in the ERC20 contract in a single transaction, instead of multiple transactions.",1032,198,6.723428010940552

Additionally, if the `value` parameter is set to a very small number, it may cause the `transferFrom` function to transfer less tokens than the owner has, leading to a denial of service attack.

The code is using the `require` function to check the return value of the `send` function, which ensures that the transaction is successful before continuing with the next iteration of the loop. This means that if any transaction fails, the entire loop will be aborted, and no funds will be lost. Therefore, this code is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack.",897,97,3.4246363639831543
137,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that has a function called `ifillArray` that fills an array with 350 addresses. The function returns true if the array is less than 1500 addresses, and false otherwise. The code does not have any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker.",715,79,2.911085844039917
138,denial of service,"  NO, this code is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The code is a simple auction contract that allows users to bid on a token. The `bid` function checks that the current bid is greater than the previous bid, and then transfers the current bid to the current frontrunner. The `currentFrontrunner` variable is set to the address of the user who made the bid.

There is no way for an attacker to manipulate the `currentFrontrunner` variable to cause a denial of service attack. The `require` statement in the `bid` function ensures that the `currentFrontrunner` variable is set to the address of the user who made the bid, and the `transfer` function in the `MultiTransfer` contract ensures that the transfer is executed correctly.

Therefore, this code is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack.",705,202,6.765014886856079
