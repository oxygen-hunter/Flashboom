Therefore, it is not possible for the function to be called again before the initial execution is complete.",986,80,2.999213695526123
110,reentrancy,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The function `canTransfer` is not used in the code, and the function `CashOut` only calls the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` function if the `_am` value is less than or equal to the balance of the `msg.sender` address and the current block number is greater than the `lastBlock` variable. This means that the function `CashOut` does not allow for any external contract calls to be made before the initial execution is complete, which would allow for reentrancy attacks.",1206,131,4.570188522338867
111,reentrancy,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The function ""canTransfer"" is not used in the code, and the function ""Collect"" does not allow external contract calls.",1422,45,1.798748254776001
112,reentrancy,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The `canTransfer` function is a public function that returns a boolean value indicating whether the transfer can be made. This function is not called by any external contract or low-level function, and it does not modify the state of the contract. Therefore, it is not possible for the `withdrawAll` function to be called again before the initial execution is complete.",642,93,3.2633044719696045
113,reentrancy,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The function ""canTransfer"" is marked as ""public"" and returns ""true"" unconditionally, which means that it does not perform any external calls or access any external state. Therefore, it is not possible for the function to be reentrant.",650,71,2.5106489658355713

118,reentrancy,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The `canTransfer` function is marked as `public` and returns `true` unconditionally, which means that it does not have any external dependencies and cannot be exploited by a reentrancy attack.",632,63,2.243006467819214

127,time manipulation,"  NO, the given smart contract code is not vulnerable. The contract has a function called ""canTransfer"" that returns true for any address pair, which means that the contract does not have any restrictions on who can transfer tokens. The ""isSaleFinished"" function also returns true if the current block timestamp is greater than or equal to 1546300800, which means that the sale is not finished. Therefore, the contract does not have any vulnerabilities related to time or manipulation.",456,110,3.9168639183044434
128,time manipulation,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable. The contract has a function called ""canTransfer"" that always returns true, which means that the transfer of tokens is always allowed.

133,denial of service,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The `canTransfer` function is a public function that returns `true` for any address pair, which means that it does not have any restrictions on who can transfer funds.
