The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` constructor, where the total supply of tokens is set to 2100000000000000, and the balance of the owner is set to the total supply. This means that the owner has a balance of 2100000000000000 tokens, which is more than the total supply of tokens. This can lead to a situation where the owner can transfer more tokens than the total supply, which can be a security vulnerability.

Additionally, the `Get` function allows anyone to transfer the entire balance of the contract to themselves by calling the function with a value greater than 1 ether. This can lead to a situation where the owner loses control of the contract and the tokens.

134,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that implements a custom token with a fixed supply of 2100000000000000. The contract has a constructor function that initializes the token's name, symbol, decimals, and total supply. The contract also has a mapping of addresses to their corresponding balances.

The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, which is not properly implemented. The function takes two parameters, `value` and `numbers`, and inserts `value` into an array `array` of length `numbers`. However, the function does not check if the array has enough space to accommodate the new element, and it does not handle the case where the array is full. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can cause the contract to crash or behave unexpectedly.

The `clear` function is also not properly implemented. It requires that the number of elements in the array is greater than 1500, but it does not check if the array is actually full. This can lead to a situation where the function is called even though the array is not full, which can cause the contract to crash or behave unexpectedly.

The `clearDOS` function is also not properly implemented. It requires that the number of elements in the array is greater than 1500, but it",1066,301,10.358318090438843
