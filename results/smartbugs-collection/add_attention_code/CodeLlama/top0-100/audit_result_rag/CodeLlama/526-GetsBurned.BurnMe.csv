The vulnerability lies in the `BurnMe` function, which uses the `selfdestruct` function to destroy the contract and send its remaining Ether to the address of the contract. This can be exploited by an attacker to steal the remaining Ether in the contract.

The vulnerability is due to the fact that the `selfdestruct` function can only be called by the contract itself, and not by an external actor. Therefore, an attacker can call the `BurnMe` function and then use the `selfdestruct` function to steal the remaining Ether in the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `BurnMe` function should only be callable by the contract owner, and not by any external actor. This can be achieved by using the `onlyOwner` modifier, which allows only the contract owner to call the function.",781,207,6.968050003051758
