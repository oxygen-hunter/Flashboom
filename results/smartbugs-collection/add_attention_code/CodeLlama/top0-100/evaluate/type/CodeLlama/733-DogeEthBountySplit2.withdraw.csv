The contract has a modifier ""onlyOwner"" which is used to restrict access to certain functions. The modifier checks if the caller is the owner of the contract before allowing the function to be executed. This ensures that only the owner of the contract can call the ""withdrawAll"" function.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function, which allows anyone to withdraw half of the contract's balance to two predefined addresses. The `withdraw` function calls the `transfer` function of the `address` type, which can execute arbitrary code. This means that an attacker can call the `withdraw` function and execute arbitrary code on the contract, potentially leading to a reentrancy attack.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to call the `withdraw` function and provide a valid address as the recipient. The attacker could then execute arbitrary code on the contract, potentially leading to a reentrancy attack.

An attacker can exploit this by calling the withdraw() function multiple times, each time withdrawing half of the contract's balance, until the contract's balance is depleted.

To fix this vulnerability, the withdraw() function should check if the contract has enough balance to cover the withdrawal before executing it.
