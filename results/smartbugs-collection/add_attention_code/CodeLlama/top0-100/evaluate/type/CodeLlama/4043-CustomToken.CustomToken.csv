17,access control,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of the `delegatecall` function in the `forward` function of the `Proxy` contract. This allows an attacker to call any function in the `CustomToken` contract, potentially allowing them to access sensitive data or execute malicious code.

The `delegatecall` function allows a contract to call another contract's functions, but it does not check the caller's permissions. This means that an attacker can call the `CustomToken` contract's functions from the `Proxy` contract, even if they do not have the necessary permissions.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` contract's constructor sets the owner of the contract to the address that deployed it, which means that the owner of the contract is the same as the address that deployed it. This means that the owner of the contract has full control over the contract and can execute any function in the contract, including the `forward` function.

Therefore, an attacker who has the address of the `Proxy` contract can call the `forward` function and execute any function in the `CustomToken` contract, potentially allowing them to access sensitive data or execute malicious code.",access control,4.0,670.0,6.0,2.3639190196990967

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to find a way to call the `sendMessage` function without paying any gas fees. This can be done by calling the function from a different contract or by using a contract that has a different gas price than the target contract. Once the attacker has called the `sendMessage` function without paying any gas fees, they can repeatedly call it and drain the contract of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `sendMessage` function should be modified to require a payment of gas fees before it can be executed.

123,reentrancy,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The reason is that the contract is not calling any external contracts or using low-level functions with external addresses, which are the common causes of reentrancy attacks. Additionally, the contract is not using the `msg.sender.call.value()` function, which is the function that is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.",reentrancy,1.0,510.0,6.0,3.0494673252105713
124,reentrancy,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The reason is that the function CashOut is not calling any external contracts, and it is not using any low level functions with an external address.",reentrancy,1.0,478.0,6.0,2.4450979232788086
125,reentrancy,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The reason is that the `Collect` function calls the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` function, which allows the contract to make a new call to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. This can cause the contract state to change in the middle of its execution, leading to unintended behavior.",reentrancy,3.0,512.0,6.0,2.195528984069824
126,reentrancy,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The reason is that the `withdrawBalance` function is not calling any external contracts or using any low-level functions that can be exploited. It only calls the `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""")` function, which is a low-level function that allows the caller to transfer Ether to the contract. However, this function is not called before the execution of the `withdrawBalance` function is complete, so there is no possibility of reentrancy attack.",reentrancy,1.0,541.0,6.0,3.0203261375427246
127,time manipulation,"  NO, this code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple contract that inherits from a base contract and defines a custom token. The custom token has a total supply of 10000000000000000000 and is named ""Global contract payment"" with symbol ""GCT(QC)"". The contract also defines a mapping of addresses to balances and an event for transferring tokens. There is no apparent vulnerability in the code.",time manipulation,1.0,519.0,6.0,5.024653673171997
128,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a combination of two contracts, the first one is the lottopollo contract, and the second one is the CustomToken contract. The CustomToken contract inherits from the BaseToken contract and adds its own functionality. The lottopollo contract uses the CustomToken contract to pay out the funds.

The lottopollo contract has a payOut function that pays out the funds to the winner. The function uses the randomGen function to generate a random number and then uses the now function to check if the random number is greater than 0 and if the current time minus the random number is greater than 24 hours. If both conditions are true, the function sends the funds to the winner.

The CustomToken contract has a totalSupply variable that is set to 10000000000000000000 and a balanceOf mapping that sets the balance of the owner to the totalSupply. The CustomToken contract also has a name, symbol, and decimals variable that are set to 'Global contract payment', 'GCT(QC)', and 10 respectively.

The code does not have any vulnerabilities.",time manipulation,1.0,666.0,6.0,2.9602856636047363
129,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to invest Ether into a jackpot and then reset the jackpot after a certain time. The contract does not use any external contracts or libraries, and it does not have any known vulnerabilities.",time manipulation,1.0,489.0,6.0,3.7920777797698975
130,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a combination of two contracts, Roulette and BaseToken, and it is not clear what the purpose of the CustomToken contract is. However, based on the code, it appears that the CustomToken contract is not used in the Roulette contract, and it does not have any vulnerabilities.",time manipulation,1.0,502.0,6.0,1.9669690132141113
131,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a smart contract that allows users to play a game by sending ether to the contract. The contract has a function called ""play"" that takes a fixed amount of ether as input and transfers a portion of it to the bank and the rest to the user. The contract also has a modifier called ""play"" that checks if the amount of ether sent is equal to the fixed amount. The modifier is used to ensure that the user sends the correct amount of ether to play the game.

Therefore, the code does not have any vulnerabilities related to the use of block.timestamp or other security issues.",time manipulation,1.0,563.0,6.0,2.163367986679077
132,short addresses,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a short address attack. The reason is that the `sendCoin` function uses the `msg.sender` address as the key to access the `balances` mapping, which is a vulnerability in the EVM. This can be exploited by using specially-crafted addresses to make poorly coded clients encode arguments incorrectly before including them in transactions.",short addresses,3.0,507.0,6.0,2.5048601627349854
133,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a smart contract that implements a simple payment system using the Ethereum blockchain. It has two functions: `emptyCreditors()` and `addCreditors()`. The `emptyCreditors()` function is called when the contract's balance is greater than 1500, which means that the contract is likely to be vulnerable to a denial of service attack. However, the `addCreditors()` function is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack because it only adds 350 addresses to the `creditorAddresses` array, which is less than 1500. Therefore, the contract is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack.",denial of service,3.0,572.0,6.0,2.634155035018921
134,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a smart contract that implements a simple array-based data structure. It has a function called `insertNnumbers` that inserts a given number of elements into an array, and a function called `clear` that clears the array. The code also has a function called `clearDOS` that clears the array and sets the number of elements to 0. The code also has two functions called `getLengthArray` and `getRealLengthArray` that return the length of the array and the real length of the array, respectively.

The code does not have any vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an attacker. The `insertNnumbers` function checks if the number of elements in the array is equal to the length of the array before inserting a new element, and it also checks if the number of elements in the array is greater than 1500 before clearing the array. The `clearDOS` function also checks if the number of elements in the array is greater than 1500 before clearing the array.

The code also has access controls in place, as the `clear` function requires the number of elements in the array to be greater than 1500, and the `clearDOS` function requires the number of elements in the array to be greater than 1500.

Overall, the code",denial of service,1.0,707.0,6.0,1.782055139541626
135,denial of service,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable.",denial of service,1.0,444.0,6.0,2.8872358798980713
136,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to refund their funds to a list of predefined addresses. The contract has a constructor function that initializes the list of refund addresses and a function called `refundAll` that iterates over the list and sends the funds to each address. The contract also has a mapping of addresses to their corresponding refund amounts.

There is no obvious vulnerability in the code that could be exploited by an attacker. The contract has a clear and well-defined functionality, and there are no obvious security risks or vulnerabilities. The only potential issue could be if the contract is used to send funds to a large number of addresses, which could potentially cause a denial of service attack if the contract runs out of gas. However, this is not a vulnerability in the code itself, but rather a potential issue that could arise if the contract is used in a way that is not intended.",denial of service,3.0,621.0,6.0,2.080700397491455
137,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that has a function called `ifillArray` that fills an array with 350 addresses. The function returns true if the array is less than 1500 addresses, and false otherwise. The code does not have any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker.",denial of service,1.0,504.0,6.0,2.77536940574646
138,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a smart contract that implements a simple auction system, where a user can bid on a token by sending Ether to the contract. The contract has a `bid` function that checks if the current bid is greater than the previous bid, and if it is, it transfers the previous bid to the previous frontrunner and updates the current frontrunner and current bid. The contract also has a `currentFrontrunner` variable that stores the address of the current frontrunner, and a `currentBid` variable that stores the current bid.

The code does not have any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker. The `bid` function is properly secured with the `require` statement, which checks if the current bid is greater than the previous bid. The `currentFrontrunner` variable is also properly initialized with the `address` of the contract creator, and the `currentBid` variable is properly initialized with the `msg.value` of the `bid` function.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to any known attacks.",denial of service,1.0,658.0,6.0,1.938762903213501
