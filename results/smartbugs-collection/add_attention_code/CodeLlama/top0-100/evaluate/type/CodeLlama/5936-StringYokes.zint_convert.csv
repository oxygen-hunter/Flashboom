The vulnerability is due to the use of the `call.value` function, which allows the caller to specify the amount of ether to send along with the message. However, the function does not check if the amount of ether sent is greater than the gas fee required to execute the function. This means that the attacker can send a message with a large amount of ether, which will not be deducted from the contract's balance.
