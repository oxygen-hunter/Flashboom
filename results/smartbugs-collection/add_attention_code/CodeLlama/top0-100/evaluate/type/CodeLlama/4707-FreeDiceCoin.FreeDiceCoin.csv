In this case, the `FreeDiceCoin` contract uses `delegatecall` to call the `transfer` function of the `BasicToken` contract, which can modify the state of the `FreeDiceCoin` contract. This can allow an attacker to repeatedly call the `transfer` function and drain the contract of funds.

The vulnerability lies in the `FreeDiceCoin` contract, which is a child contract of the `StandardToken` contract.

This can be exploited by a malicious actor to transfer tokens from one address to another without the owner's consent.

Additionally, the `FreeDiceCoin` contract also overrides the `balances` mapping, which can be used to manipulate the token balances of any address. This can be used to drain the tokens from a specific address or to transfer tokens to a specific address.

The `mul` function is used in the `FreeDiceCoin` contract to calculate the total supply of the token. If the total supply is too large, it can lead to an integer overflow, which can cause the contract to fail.

To fix this vulnerability, the `mul` function in the `SafeMath` library should be modified to use the `mul` function in the `SafeMath` library, which is a safe operation.
