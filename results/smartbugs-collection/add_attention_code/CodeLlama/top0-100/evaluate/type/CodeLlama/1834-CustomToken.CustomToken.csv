The `balanceOf` function also has an integer overflow vulnerability. The line `return balances[_owner];` can cause an integer overflow if the `_owner` has a large balance.

Therefore, the contract does not allow reentrancy attacks.",reentrancy,1.0,539.0,6.0,2.609135150909424
126,reentrancy,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The reason is that the `withdrawBalance` function is not calling any external contracts or using any low-level functions that can be exploited. It only calls the `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""")` function, which is a low-level function that allows the caller to transfer Ether to the contract. However, this function is not called before the execution of the `withdrawBalance` function is complete, so there is no possibility of reentrancy attack.",reentrancy,1.0,541.0,6.0,2.520216703414917
127,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a solidity contract that has a function called isSaleFinished() that returns true if the current block timestamp is greater than or equal to 1546300800. This function is not vulnerable to any known attacks.",time manipulation,1.0,488.0,6.0,2.286818742752075
128,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a combination of two contracts, the first one is a lottopollo contract and the second one is a CustomToken contract. The CustomToken contract inherits from the BaseToken contract and it has its own constructor function. The constructor function initializes the totalSupply, name, symbol, and decimals of the token. The balanceOf mapping is also initialized with the address of the owner of the token. The CustomToken contract does not have any vulnerabilities.",time manipulation,1.0,535.0,6.0,2.399014711380005
129,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to invest Ether into a jackpot and then reset the jackpot after a certain time. The contract does not use any external contracts or libraries, and it does not have any known vulnerabilities.",time manipulation,1.0,489.0,6.0,3.1927146911621094
130,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a combination of two contracts, Roulette and BaseToken, and it is not clear what the purpose of the CustomToken contract is. However, based on the code, it appears that the CustomToken contract is not used in any way in the Roulette contract, and it does not have any vulnerabilities.",time manipulation,1.0,505.0,6.0,1.9063963890075684
131,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a solidity contract that implements a simple lottery game. It has a play function that takes a payment of 10 ether and randomly distributes the funds between the bank and the player. The code also has a modifier that checks if the player has sent the correct amount of ether. The code does not use any external libraries or functions that could be vulnerable.",time manipulation,1.0,515.0,6.0,1.8471760749816895
132,short addresses,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a short address attack. The reason is that the `sendCoin` function uses the `msg.sender` address as the key to access the `balances` mapping, which is a vulnerability in the EVM. This can be exploited by sending a specially crafted transaction that includes a short address, which will be padded with zeros to make it the correct length. This will cause the `balances` mapping to access a different address than intended, potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate the contract's state.",short addresses,3.0,540.0,6.0,2.2098069190979004
133,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a smart contract that inherits from the BaseToken contract and adds a new function called ""CustomToken"" that initializes the total supply of tokens, the name, symbol, and decimals of the token. It also sets the balance of the owner of the contract to the total supply of tokens. The code does not have any vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an attacker.",denial of service,1.0,519.0,6.0,2.4454615116119385
134,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a smart contract that implements a simple array-based data structure. It has a function called `insertNnumbers` that inserts a given number of elements into an array, and a function called `clear` that clears the array. The code also has a function called `clearDOS` that clears the array and sets the number of elements to 0. The code also has two functions called `getLengthArray` and `getRealLengthArray` that return the length of the array and the real length of the array, respectively.

The code does not have any vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an attacker. The `insertNnumbers` function checks if the number of elements in the array is equal to the length of the array before inserting a new element, and it also checks if the number of elements in the array is greater than 1500 before clearing the array. The `clearDOS` function also checks if the number of elements in the array is greater than 1500 before clearing the array.

The code also has access controls in place, as the `clear` function requires the number of elements in the array to be greater than 1500, and the `clearDOS` function requires the number of elements in the array to be greater than 1500 before clearing the array.

137,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that has a function called `ifillArray` that fills an array with 350 addresses. The function returns true if the array is less than 1500 addresses, and false otherwise. The code does not have any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker.",denial of service,1.0,504.0,6.0,3.854884147644043
138,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a smart contract that implements a simple auction mechanism, where a user can bid on a token by sending Ether to the contract. The contract has a `bid` function that checks if the current bid is greater than the previous bid, and if so, it sends the previous bid to the current frontrunner and updates the current frontrunner and current bid. The contract also has a `BaseToken` contract that inherits from the `BaseToken` contract and has a `CustomToken` contract that inherits from the `BaseToken` contract. The `CustomToken` contract has a `totalSupply` variable that is set to 1000000000000000000000000000, and a `balanceOf` mapping that sets the balance of the contract's creator to the total supply. The `Transfer` event is also emitted when the contract is created.

Therefore, the given code does not have any vulnerabilities related to denial of service.",denial of service,1.0,636.0,6.0,1.9951257705688477
