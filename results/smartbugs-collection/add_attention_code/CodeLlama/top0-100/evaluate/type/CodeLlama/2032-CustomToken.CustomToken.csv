The `CustomToken` contract does not have a constructor function, which means that the `totalSupply` variable is not initialized. This means that the `totalSupply` variable is set to a default value of 0, which means that the `balanceOf` mapping is also set to a default value of 0. This means that the `CustomToken` contract has no tokens in its balance, and the `transfer` function in the `BaseToken` contract will fail if it is called.

Therefore, the `CustomToken` contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack, as the `transfer` function in the `BaseToken` contract can be called multiple times, leading to a failure of the contract.",unchecked low level calls,2.0,610.0,6.0,2.3636586666107178

The transfer function is called in the constructor, which means it is executed only once when the contract is deployed. The owner is set to the address that deployed the contract, which is the msg.sender at the time of deployment. Therefore, there is no possibility of the owner being changed by an attacker.

Furthermore, the transfer function is called with the `msg.sender` address as the first argument, which means that the function can only be called by the owner of the contract. The `require` statement at the beginning of the function ensures that the function can only be called by the owner, and the `transfer` function is called with the `msg.sender` address as the first argument, which means that the function can only be called by the owner of the contract.

The vulnerability lies in the use of the `call` function, which does not propagate errors and will return a boolean value of `false` if the call fails. This can lead to fail-opens and other unwanted outcomes if the return value of the `call` function is not checked.

The vulnerability is in the `transfer` function, specifically in the line `caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v[i]);`. If the call to the `transferFrom` function fails, the `call` function will return `false`, but the `transfer` function will still return `true`. This can lead to a situation where the `transfer` function appears to be successful, but the `transferFrom` function has actually failed, resulting in a loss of funds.

124,reentrancy,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The reason is that the function CashOut is not calling any external contracts, and it is not using any low level functions with an external address.",reentrancy,3.0,478.0,6.0,1.8383092880249023
125,reentrancy,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The reason is that the `Collect` function calls the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` function, which allows the contract to make a new call to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. This can cause the contract state to change in the middle of its execution, leading to unintended behavior.",reentrancy,3.0,512.0,6.0,2.17109751701355
126,reentrancy,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The code is a simple smart contract that has a single function called `withdrawBalance` which allows the user to withdraw their balance from the contract. The function uses the `call.value` function to transfer the balance to the user's address, and then sets the user's balance to 0. The function also uses the `require` function to check the success of the transfer.

There is no way for an external contract to call the `withdrawBalance` function again before the initial execution is complete, as the function is only called by the user's address. Therefore, there is no possibility of reentrancy attack.",reentrancy,1.0,570.0,6.0,3.3130695819854736
127,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple contract that inherits from a base contract and overrides the constructor to set the total supply of tokens and the balance of a specific address. It does not contain any vulnerabilities related to time or manipulation.",time manipulation,1.0,486.0,6.0,2.1786317825317383
128,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a solidity contract that has a function called ""draw"" which calls the ""payOut"" function with a random number generated by the ""randomGen"" function. The ""payOut"" function checks if the random number is greater than 0 and if the current time minus the random number is greater than 24 hours, it sends the msg.value to the msg.sender and if the contract balance is greater than 0, it sends the contract balance to the leader. The ""randomGen"" function returns the block.timestamp.

The code does not have any vulnerabilities in the given code.",time manipulation,1.0,562.0,6.0,2.0212302207946777
129,time manipulation,"  NO, this code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to invest Ether into a jackpot and then reset the jackpot after a certain amount of time has passed. The contract does not use any external contracts or libraries, and it does not have any known vulnerabilities.",time manipulation,1.0,492.0,6.0,1.813107967376709
130,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows anyone to send 10 Ether to the contract, and the contract will transfer the funds to the sender if the current time is a multiple of 15. There is no apparent vulnerability in the code.",time manipulation,1.0,492.0,6.0,2.5222926139831543
131,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to play a game by sending ether to the contract. The contract has a single function called ""play"" that takes no arguments and returns nothing. The function first asserts that the sender has sent the correct amount of ether (10 wei) and then adds the amount to the pot. It then generates a random number using the block.timestamp and checks if it is equal to 0. If it is, it transfers 1 wei to the bank and the remaining amount to the sender. The contract does not use any external contracts or libraries, and it does not have any access control vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to any known attacks.",time manipulation,1.0,581.0,6.0,2.316192388534546
132,short addresses,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a short address attack. The reason is that the `sendCoin` function uses the `msg.sender` address as the key to access the `balances` mapping, which is a vulnerability in the EVM. This allows an attacker to exploit the contract by sending a specially crafted transaction that causes the `msg.sender` address to be encoded incorrectly, leading to a short address attack.",short addresses,3.0,518.0,6.0,2.2602462768554688
133,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The code is a simple smart contract that has two functions: `emptyCreditors` and `addCreditors`. The `emptyCreditors` function is vulnerable to a denial of service attack because it sets the `creditorAddresses` array to an empty array if the length of the array is greater than 1500. This can cause the contract to run out of gas and fail. However, the `addCreditors` function does not have this vulnerability.",denial of service,4.0,543.0,6.0,3.0525004863739014
134,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that has a function to insert a number into an array and a function to clear the array. There is no evidence of any vulnerability in the code.",denial of service,1.0,481.0,6.0,2.594883680343628
135,denial of service,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable. The code is written in Solidity, and it is a well-known and widely-used language for writing smart contracts. The code is also well-structured and easy to understand, which suggests that it is not vulnerable to any common attacks.",denial of service,1.0,490.0,6.0,2.098231792449951
136,denial of service,"  NO, this code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to refund their funds to a list of predefined addresses. The contract has a constructor that initializes the list of refund addresses and a function called ""refundAll"" that sends the funds to each address in the list. The contract also has a mapping of addresses to their corresponding refund amounts.

There is no apparent vulnerability in the code. The contract is well-structured and the functions are clearly defined. The only potential issue could be if the contract is used to send funds to a malicious address, but this is not a vulnerability in the code itself.",denial of service,1.0,561.0,6.0,2.7199947834014893
137,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that has a function called `ifillArray` that fills an array with 350 addresses. The function returns true if the array is less than 1500 addresses, and false otherwise. The code does not have any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker.",denial of service,1.0,504.0,6.0,2.1666009426116943
138,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to bid on a token. It has a modifier that checks if the bid is greater than the current bid, and it also checks if the current frontrunner is not 0 before sending the bid. The code also sets the current frontrunner to the sender of the transaction and sets the current bid to the value of the transaction.

Therefore, the code does not have any known vulnerabilities.",denial of service,1.0,533.0,6.0,3.150806427001953
