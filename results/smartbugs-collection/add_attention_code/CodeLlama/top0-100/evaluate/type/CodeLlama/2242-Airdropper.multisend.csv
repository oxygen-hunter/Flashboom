126,reentrancy,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The contract has a modifier ""onlyOwner"" which checks if the caller is the owner of the contract before executing the function. This modifier ensures that the function can only be executed by the owner of the contract, and prevents any external contract from calling the function. Therefore, the reentrancy attack is not possible in this case.",reentrancy,1.0,515.0,6.0,2.2497718334198
127,time manipulation,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of the `block.timestamp` variable, which is a source of randomness. However, the contract does not use a secure random number generator, and the value of `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners. This can lead to a reentrancy attack, where an attacker can repeatedly call the `multisend` function and drain the contract of funds.

The vulnerability is due to the fact that the `block.timestamp` variable is used to generate random numbers, which is a common vulnerability in smart contracts. The `block.timestamp` variable is not a secure random number generator, and it can be manipulated by miners. This means that the random numbers generated by the contract can be predictable, which can lead to a reentrancy attack.

To fix the vulnerability, the contract should use a secure random number generator, such as the `random` function in the `SafeMath` library. The `random` function generates a random number using the `block.timestamp` variable, but it also uses a secure random number generator to generate the random number. This ensures that the random number is truly random and not predictable.",time manipulation,4.0,673.0,6.0,2.243910074234009
128,time manipulation,"  NO, this code is not vulnerable. The code is using the `Ownable` contract from the OpenZeppelin library, which provides a secure way to manage ownership and access control. The `multisend` function is only accessible to the owner of the contract, and it only allows the transfer of tokens to a maximum of 1000 addresses. Additionally, the `ERC20` contract is used to transfer tokens, which is a well-tested and secure way to do so.",time manipulation,1.0,531.0,6.0,3.2091331481933594
129,time manipulation,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable.

The contract is also using the `block.timestamp` to generate random numbers, but it is doing so in a way that is secure. The contract is also using the `block.timestamp` to check if the investment period has ended, and if it has, it is sending the funds to the last investor and resetting the contract's state.",time manipulation,1.0,540.0,6.0,3.795809745788574
130,time manipulation,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of the `now` variable, which is a block timestamp, and is used to determine the winner of the game.

Additionally, the `pastBlockTime` variable is not updated properly, which can lead to a denial of service attack.",time manipulation,4.0,527.0,6.0,2.949535846710205

132,short addresses,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a short address attack. The reason is that the `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract uses the `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function, which does not check the validity of the `to` address before sending the tokens. This means that an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending tokens to a short address, which will cause the contract to revert and lose the tokens.",short addresses,3.0,528.0,6.0,2.857006311416626
