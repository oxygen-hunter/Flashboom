35,unchecked low level calls,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The reason is that it uses the `multisend` function from the `Airdrop` contract, which allows an attacker to send a large number of tokens to a list of addresses in a single transaction. This can lead to a vulnerability known as the ""reentrancy attack"", where an attacker can repeatedly call the `multisend` function and drain the contract of funds.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have a list of addresses and the corresponding token amounts that they want to send. They would then need to call the `multisend` function repeatedly, each time with a different set of addresses and token amounts. This can be done by using a loop to repeatedly call the `multisend` function, or by using a contract that can call the `multisend` function repeatedly.

To fix this vulnerability, the `Airdrop` contract should be modified to prevent reentrancy attacks. One way to do this is to use the `check-effects-interactions` modifier, which can be used to prevent reentrancy attacks by checking the effects of a function before it is executed.

In this case, the `assert` keyword is checking the return value of the `transfer` function, which is a boolean value indicating whether the transfer was successful or not.

87,arithmetic,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The `multisend` function in the `Airdrop` contract calls the `transfer` function of the `Token` contract multiple times, which can lead to a reentrancy attack if the `transfer` function modifies the state of the `Token` contract in a way that can be exploited.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `multisend` function calls the `transfer` function of the `Token` contract multiple times, which can cause the `transfer` function to be called multiple times in a single transaction. This can lead to a reentrancy attack, where an attacker can repeatedly call the `transfer` function and drain the contract of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `multisend` function should be modified to use the `transferFrom` function of the `Token` contract instead of the `transfer` function. This will prevent the `transfer` function from being called multiple times in a single transaction, and will ensure that the contract is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.",arithmetic,2.0,656.0,6.0,1.9126849174499512

To fix this vulnerability, the `multisend` function should use the `require` statement instead of `assert`, which checks for overflows and throws an exception if an overflow occurs.

However, the function does not check if the recipient addresses are valid or if the token transfer was successful.
