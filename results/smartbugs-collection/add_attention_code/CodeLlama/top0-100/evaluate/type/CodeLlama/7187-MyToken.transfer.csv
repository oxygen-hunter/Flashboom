The contract is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack because it has a mapping (address => uint) public balanceOf; which is used to store the balance of each address. The transfer function is used to transfer coins from one address to another. The contract also has a function called totalDebt() which returns the total debt of the contract.",denial of service,1.0,611.0,6.0,3.33842134475708
136,denial of service,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The `transfer` function is properly protected with `require` statements, and the `refundAll` function is not vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.",denial of service,1.0,481.0,6.0,11.394871234893799
137,denial of service,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The contract has a safe upper limit for loops and does not use any function modifiers that can cause reentrancy attacks. Additionally, the contract uses the block timestamp for critical functionality, but it is properly protected by the use of the `require` statement.",denial of service,1.0,501.0,6.0,4.350021123886108
138,denial of service,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The code is well-written and there are no obvious vulnerabilities.",denial of service,1.0,462.0,6.0,2.615027904510498
