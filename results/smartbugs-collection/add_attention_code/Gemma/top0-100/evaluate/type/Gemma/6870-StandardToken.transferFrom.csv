The `transferFrom` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  A reentrancy attack occurs when a malicious actor calls a contract's function multiple times within a short timeframe, exploiting the contract's internal logic. 
* **The Vulnerability:** The `transferFrom` function allows for the transfer of funds from one address to another.  If an attacker can call this function repeatedly, they can potentially drain the funds from the contract.

* **Insufficient Balance:** The `_value` parameter is not checked against the balance of the sender (`_from`). This could lead to a situation where the contract attempts to transfer more tokens than the sender has.
