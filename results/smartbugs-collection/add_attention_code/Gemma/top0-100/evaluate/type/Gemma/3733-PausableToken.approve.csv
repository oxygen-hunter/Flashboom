* **Exploiting the Vulnerability:**  An attacker could call `approve` repeatedly, setting a large allowance, and then call the `transfer` function with the same spender.  This could drain the contract's funds.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `if` statement allows the contract to call an external contract (`msg.sender.call.value(_am)`) before the initial execution is complete.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:** This means an attacker could call the `Collect` function multiple times in rapid succession, draining the contract's funds.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **Unprotected External Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which allows an attacker to potentially call the contract again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:** This creates a reentrancy vulnerability, as the attacker can call the contract again before the initial execution is complete.
