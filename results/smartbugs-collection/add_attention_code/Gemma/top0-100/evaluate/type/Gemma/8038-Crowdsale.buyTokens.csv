* **Unchecked Return Values:** The `claimThrone` function returns a boolean value, but it doesn't check if the return value is true or false. This can lead to unexpected behavior.
* **Low Level Function Calls:** The `claimThrone` function uses `msg.sender.send` and `wizardAddress.send` which are low level functions. These functions don't propagate errors, so if they fail, the contract will continue to execute. 
* **Unprotected Access Control:** The `transferOwnership` function allows anyone to change the contract's owner. This is a security vulnerability. 
* **Reentrancy Attacks:** The `claimThrone` function could be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
* **Arithmetic Overflows and Underflows:** The code doesn't handle arithmetic overflows and underflows well. 
* **Timestamp Dependence:** The `claimThrone` function uses the block timestamp for critical functionality. This can be manipulated by miners.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unprotected External Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls `_addr.call.value(_wei)()` which is an external call. This means the contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times in rapid succession, potentially draining funds from the contract. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The contract lacks any safeguards to prevent multiple calls to `WithdrawToHolder` from the same address.
