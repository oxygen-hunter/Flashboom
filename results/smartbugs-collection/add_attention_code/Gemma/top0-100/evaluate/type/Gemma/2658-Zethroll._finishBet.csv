The contract uses a function `_finishBet` that simulates a betting system. This function has a high potential for denial of service attacks. 

Here's why:

* **Unpredictable Behavior:** The `_finishBet` function relies on a random number generation using `random` function. This makes it difficult to predict the outcome, potentially leading to a denial of service attack.
* **Infinite Loops:** The `_finishBet` function could potentially create an infinite loop if the random number generation is not properly controlled. This would consume all the contract's gas and make it unavailable for other transactions. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `_finishBet` function has access to the contract's balance and can potentially manipulate it. This could be exploited to drain the contract of funds. 
* **Lack of Security Measures:** The contract lacks any security measures to prevent denial of service attacks.
