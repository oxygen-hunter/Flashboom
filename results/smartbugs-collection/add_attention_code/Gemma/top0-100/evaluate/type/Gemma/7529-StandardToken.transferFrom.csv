The contract uses the `transferFrom` function, which is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  The `transferFrom` function allows for the transfer of tokens from one address to another.  The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `transferFrom` function does not have any checks in place to prevent reentrancy attacks.  This means that an attacker could call the `transferFrom` function multiple times in a row, draining the contract of funds.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unrestricted External Calls:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function allows external calls to the contract's `Withdraw` function.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time attempting to drain funds from the contract. 
* **No Safeguards:** The function doesn't include any safeguards to prevent this type of attack.
