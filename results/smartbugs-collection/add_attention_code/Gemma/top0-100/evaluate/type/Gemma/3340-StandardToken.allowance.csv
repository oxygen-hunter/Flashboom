The `allowance` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  A reentrancy attack occurs when a malicious contract calls a function within itself, potentially leading to unintended consequences.
* **Vulnerability:** The `allowance` function doesn't explicitly check for reentrancy. If an attacker can call the `Command` function multiple times, they could potentially drain the contract's funds. 
* **Example:** An attacker could call `Command` with a malicious payload that calls `allowance` repeatedly, draining the contract's funds.

* **Low Level Function Calls:** The `send` function can fail, and the code doesn't handle this. 
* **Unprotected Access Control:** The `transferOwnership` function is not restricted to specific addresses, making it vulnerable to attacks. 
* **Lack of Error Handling:** The code doesn't handle errors gracefully, leaving it open to exploits. 
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:** The `claimThrone` function could be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
* **Arithmetic Overflows and Underflows:** The code doesn't handle arithmetic overflows and underflows well. 
* **Timestamp Dependence:** The code relies on the block timestamp for critical functionality, which can be manipulated. 
* **Unclear Contract Logic:** The code lacks clear and concise comments, making it difficult to understand the intended functionality.

The contract uses a mapping called `allowed` to track the allowance of tokens for specific addresses. This mapping is used to determine the amount of tokens that an address can spend on behalf of another address.  However, the contract does not implement any checks to prevent reentrancy attacks. This means that an attacker could potentially call the `getFirstWithdrawalBonus` function repeatedly, leading to a reentrancy attack.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `Collect` function doesn't handle the external contract call's return value. This means an attacker could potentially call the `Collect` function multiple times in rapid succession, draining the contract's funds.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled External Calls:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls an external address (`_addr`) with the value (`_wei`) sent to it. This means the contract doesn't know what the external address will do with the funds.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time with a different amount, potentially draining the contract's funds. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The contract doesn't have any safeguards to prevent this type of attack.

The `airDrop` function in the `ModifierEntrancy` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `airDrop` function calls `ModifierEntrancy(msg.sender).airDrop()` which means it can be called repeatedly.
* **No Locking:** The `airDrop` function does not have any locking mechanisms to prevent multiple calls. 
* **Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `airDrop` repeatedly, potentially draining the contract's funds.
