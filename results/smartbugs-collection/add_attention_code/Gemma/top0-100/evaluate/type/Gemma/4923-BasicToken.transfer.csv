The code has several vulnerabilities:

* **Unchecked Return Values:** The `claimThrone` function returns a boolean value, but it doesn't check if the return value is true or false. This can lead to unexpected behavior.
* **Low Level Function Calls:** The `claimThrone` function uses `msg.sender.send(valuePaid)` and `msg.sender.send(excessPaid)`. These functions are low-level and can be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.
* **Unprotected Access Control:** The `transferOwnership` function allows anyone to change the contract's owner. This is a security risk. 
* **Unclear State Management:** The contract doesn't have clear state management, which can lead to unexpected behavior. 
* **Lack of Error Handling:** The contract doesn't handle errors gracefully. 
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:** The `claimThrone` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
* **Arithmetic Overflow/Underflow:** The contract doesn't handle arithmetic overflows and underflows well. 
* **Timestamp Dependence:** The contract uses the block timestamp for critical functionality, which can be manipulated by miners. 
* **Lack of Randomness:** The contract doesn't use true randomness, which can lead to vulnerabilities.

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `call.value(_am)` function allows the contract to execute arbitrary code on the `msg.sender` address. 
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:**  This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the `Collect` function, draining the contract's funds.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unrestricted External Calls:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function allows external calls to the contract's `Withdraw` function.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time attempting to drain funds from the contract. 
* **No Safeguards:** The contract lacks any safeguards to prevent this type of attack.

The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `CashOut` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `call.value(_am)` function allows the contract to execute arbitrary code on the `msg.sender` address. This means an attacker could potentially call the `CashOut` function multiple times within a short period, draining the contract's funds.
