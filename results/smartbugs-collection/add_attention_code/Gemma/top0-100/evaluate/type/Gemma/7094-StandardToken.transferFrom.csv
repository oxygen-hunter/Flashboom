The vulnerability lies in the `cash` function.  The `winner.send(subpot)` line is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  A reentrancy attack occurs when an attacker calls a contract's function while it's still executing a transaction. This can lead to a malicious actor draining funds from the contract.
* **The Problem:** The `cash` function doesn't handle reentrancy.  The `winner.send(subpot)` line is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  An attacker could call the `cash` function multiple times in a row, potentially draining funds from the contract.

The `withdraw` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `withdraw` function uses `msg.sender.call.value(amount)()`. This means it's calling an external contract (likely the `SimpleDAO`) with the `amount` value.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `withdraw` function doesn't explicitly check for reentrancy. An attacker could call `withdraw` multiple times, each time before the previous one resolves, potentially draining funds.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unprotected External Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls `_addr.call.value(_wei)()` which is a direct call to an external address. This means an attacker could potentially call the function multiple times in a row, leading to a reentrancy attack. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The function doesn't include any safeguards to prevent reentrancy.
