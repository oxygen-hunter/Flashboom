The code uses the SafeMath library, which is a common practice to prevent integer overflows and underflows. However, the code still has potential vulnerabilities. 

Here's why:

* **Arithmetic Operations:** The contract uses arithmetic operations like addition, multiplication, and subtraction. These operations can lead to overflows or underflows if not handled correctly.
* **Unrestricted Access:** The contract allows anyone to call functions like `overflowaddtostate`, `overflowmultostate`, `underflowtostate`, `overflowlocalonly`, and `overflowmulocalonly`. This means an attacker could potentially manipulate the contract's state. 
* **Lack of Input Validation:** The contract doesn't validate the input values before performing arithmetic operations. An attacker could send a large or unexpected value to trigger an overflow or underflow.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `Collect` function doesn't explicitly check for reentrancy. If an attacker calls `Collect` multiple times in rapid succession, they could potentially drain the contract's funds.

Here's why:

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unrestricted External Calls:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function allows external calls to the contract's `Withdraw` function.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time before the previous one resolves. This creates a loop where the contract's state is constantly changing, potentially leading to a reentrancy attack.
