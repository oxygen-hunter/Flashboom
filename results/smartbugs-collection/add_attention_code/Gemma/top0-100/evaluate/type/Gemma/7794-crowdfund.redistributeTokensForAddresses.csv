The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `if` statement within `Collect` allows the contract to call an external contract (`msg.sender.call.value(_am)`) before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:** This creates a window for an attacker to call the `Collect` function again and again, draining the contract's funds.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled External Calls:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function allows external calls to the contract's `Withdraw` function.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time before the previous one resolves. This creates a loop where the contract's state is constantly changing, potentially leading to a reentrancy attack.
