* **Reentrancy:** The function `_transferWithRate` allows for external calls to be made before the initial execution is complete. This can be exploited by an attacker to drain the contract of funds.
* **Unchecked Return Values:** The function `_transferWithRate` does not check the return value of the external call. This can lead to vulnerabilities.
* **Access Control:** The function `_transferWithRate` does not have proper access control. This can lead to vulnerabilities. 
* **Unclear Logic:** The logic of the function is not clear and can be exploited by an attacker.

123,reentrancy,"YES
The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This call to an external contract could be re-entered by the attacker, leading to a re-entrancy attack. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `Collect` function doesn't have proper checks to prevent the attacker from repeatedly calling the function.

The code has a potential vulnerability related to the `_transferWithRate` function.  Here's why:

* **Unclear Transfer Rate and Fee Logic:** The function's logic for calculating transfer fees and transfer rates is not clearly defined. This makes it difficult to assess the security of the contract.
* **Potential for Arbitrary Fee Manipulation:** The code allows for arbitrary fees to be charged, which could be exploited by attackers. 
* **Lack of Robust Rate and Fee Management:** The code lacks robust rate and fee management, making it vulnerable to manipulation. 
* **Potential for Unintended Transfers:** The code's logic for transferring tokens and managing balances is not clear, making it vulnerable to unintended transfers. 


It's important to note that this is a complex issue and requires a deep understanding of the code and the underlying blockchain.

The code implements a function `_transferWithRate` that appears to be designed to transfer funds, but it includes several vulnerabilities that could lead to denial of service attacks. 

Here's why:

* **Unclear Transfer Rate:** The code doesn't specify how the transfer rate is determined. This could be manipulated by an attacker to drain funds.
* **Unclear Transfer Fee:** The code doesn't specify how the transfer fee is calculated. This could be manipulated by an attacker to drain funds.
* **Unclear Access Control:** The code uses `allowed` array to control access to funds. This could be manipulated by an attacker to drain funds.
* **Unclear Balance Checks:** The code doesn't check for sufficient balances before transferring funds. This could be manipulated by an attacker to drain funds. 
* **Unclear Transfer Fee Calculation:** The code doesn't specify how the transfer fee is calculated. This could be manipulated by an attacker to drain funds. 
* **Unclear Fee Receivers:** The code doesn't specify how the fee receivers are determined. This could be manipulated by an attacker to drain funds. 


These vulnerabilities make the contract susceptible to denial of service attacks.
