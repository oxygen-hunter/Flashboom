The code has several vulnerabilities:

* **Unchecked Return Values:** The `claimThrone` function doesn't check the return value of `msg.sender.send(valuePaid)`, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
* **Low Level Function Calls:** The `claimThrone` function uses `msg.sender.send(valuePaid)` and `msg.sender.send(excessPaid)`, which are low-level functions that don't propagate errors. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.
* **Unprotected Access:** The `transferOwnership` function allows anyone to change the contract's owner, which could be exploited. 
* **Reentrancy:** The `claimThrone` function could be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
* **Arithmetic Overflows:** The code doesn't handle arithmetic overflows and underflows well. 
* **Timestamp Dependence:** The `claimThrone` function uses the block timestamp for critical functionality, which can be manipulated by miners. 
* **Unclear Logic:** The code is not well-structured and lacks comments, making it difficult to understand and potentially leading to errors.

* **Potential for Unintended Execution:**  The attacker can potentially execute the `cash` function multiple times, leading to unintended execution and potentially draining funds.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a direct call to the sender's contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `Collect` function could be called repeatedly by an attacker, leading to a reentrancy attack.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `if` statement allows the contract to call an external contract (`msg.sender.call.value(_am)`) before the `Collect` function completes.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This external call can be exploited by an attacker to call the `Collect` function again and again, draining the contract's funds.
