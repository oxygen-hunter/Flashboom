* **Reentrancy Attacks:** The `claimThrone` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. This is because it doesn't check the return value of `msg.sender.send(valuePaid)`. 
* **Arithmetic Overflows and Underflows:** The code doesn't handle arithmetic overflows and underflows well. This can lead to vulnerabilities.

The `callnotchecked` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  A reentrancy attack occurs when an attacker calls a contract function multiple times within a short timeframe, exploiting the contract's ability to execute code in a specific order.
* **`callnotchecked` Vulnerability:** The `callnotchecked` function directly calls the `callee` address without any checks. This means an attacker could potentially call the function repeatedly, leading to a reentrancy attack. 
* **Exploitation:**  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by calling `callnotchecked` repeatedly, draining the contract's funds.

* **Vulnerability:** The `increaseApproval` function doesn't handle reentrancy. If an attacker calls `increaseApproval` multiple times in rapid succession, they could potentially manipulate the allowance and drain the contract's funds.
