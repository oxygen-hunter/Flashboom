The code has several vulnerabilities:

* **Unchecked Return Values:** The `claimThrone` function doesn't check the return value of `msg.sender.send(valuePaid)`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.
* **Low Level Function Calls:** The `send` function can fail, and the code doesn't handle this.

The `allowed` mapping stores the allowance for each address, and the `add` function in the `SafeMath` library adds the new value to the existing value.  If the `_addedValue` is too large, it can overflow the `uint256` data type, leading to unexpected behavior and potential for exploits.

The `increaseApproval` function in the `StandardToken` contract allows for the allowance of tokens to be increased. This function is vulnerable to integer overflows. 

Here's why:

* **Unbounded Integer Addition:** The `add` function in the `SafeMath` library adds two unsigned integers without any overflow checks. 
* **Potential for Overflow:** If the `_addedValue` is large enough, it could exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256. 
* **Impact:** This could lead to an overflow, potentially causing the `allowed` mapping to store an incorrect value, which could have security implications.
