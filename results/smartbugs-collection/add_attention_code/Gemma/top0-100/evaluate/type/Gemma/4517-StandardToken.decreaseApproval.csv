* **Integer Overflow:** The `decreaseApproval` function subtracts a value from the `allowed` mapping. If the `_subtractedValue` is larger than the current `allowed` value, it could lead to an overflow, potentially causing the `allowed` value to become negative or even exceed the maximum value allowed by the contract. 
* **Potential for Exploitation:** This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to drain the contract's funds.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which allows an attacker to potentially call the contract again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Reentrancy:** This creates a reentrancy vulnerability because the contract's state can be changed in the middle of its execution.
