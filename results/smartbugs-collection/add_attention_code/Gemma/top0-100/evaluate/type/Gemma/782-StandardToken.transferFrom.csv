The `callnotchecked` function in the `ReturnValue` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `callee.call()` function executes the target contract's code without any checks or safeguards. This allows an attacker to potentially execute malicious code within the target contract.
