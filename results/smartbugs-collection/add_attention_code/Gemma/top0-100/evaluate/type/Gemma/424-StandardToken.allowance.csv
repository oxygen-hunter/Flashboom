The `allowance` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  A reentrancy attack occurs when a malicious contract calls a function within a contract that is still executing. 
* **Vulnerability:** The `allowance` function doesn't handle reentrancy. If an attacker can call the `allowance` function multiple times, they can potentially drain the contract's funds.

The contract uses a mapping called `allowed` to track the allowance of tokens for a specific address. This mapping is used to determine the amount of tokens that an address can spend. However, the contract does not implement any checks to prevent an attacker from manipulating the `allowed` mapping. This could allow an attacker to change the amount of tokens that an address is allowed to spend, leading to a reentrancy attack.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled External Calls:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls an external address (`_addr`) using `_addr.call.value(_wei)`. This means the contract doesn't know the outcome of the external call.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time before the previous one has finished. This could lead to a reentrancy attack, where the contract's state is manipulated.

The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `CashOut` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which allows an attacker to potentially call the contract again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:** This creates a reentrancy vulnerability because the contract's state can be altered in the middle of its execution.

* **Lack of Safeguards:** The code doesn't have any safeguards to prevent this type of attack.
