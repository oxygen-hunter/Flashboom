The contract uses the `_finishBet` function to handle bets and calculate profits. This function has a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 

Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:** The `_finishBet` function allows for external calls to be made within the function. This creates a potential for an attacker to call the function multiple times before the contract has a chance to complete the transaction. 
* **Potential for Exploitation:**  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling `_finishBet` with different inputs, draining the contract's funds.

The `_finishBet` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The function calls `ZTHTKN.transfer` which is an external contract call. This means the contract can be called again before the initial execution is complete.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `_finishBet` function could be called multiple times by an attacker, leading to a reentrancy attack.

The `_finishBet` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The function calls an external contract (`ZTHTKN`) before resolving the effects of the current execution.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `_finishBet` multiple times within a short timeframe, potentially draining the contract's funds. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The code lacks any checks to prevent repeated calls to `_finishBet` or to ensure that the external contract is not being manipulated.
