* **Unchecked Return Values:** The `claimThrone` function returns a boolean value, but it doesn't check if the return value is true or false. This can lead to unexpected behavior.

* **Unprotected Access:** The `transferOwnership` function allows anyone to change the contract's owner. This is a security vulnerability.

The `withdraw` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `withdraw` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(amount)`, which allows an attacker to potentially call the contract again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:** This creates a reentrancy vulnerability because the contract's state can be altered in the middle of its execution.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unprotected External Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls `_addr.call.value(_wei)()` which is a direct call to the external address. This means an attacker could potentially call the function multiple times in a row, leading to a reentrancy attack. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The function doesn't include any checks to prevent the attacker from calling the function repeatedly.
