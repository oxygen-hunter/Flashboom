The `sendTokens` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  A reentrancy attack occurs when a malicious contract calls a function within itself, potentially leading to unintended consequences.
* **Vulnerability:** The `sendTokens` function doesn't have any explicit checks to prevent reentrancy.  A malicious contract could call `sendTokens` multiple times in rapid succession, potentially draining the contract's funds.

 The `send()` function in Solidity is a low-level function that can be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `send()` function does not propagate errors. This means that if an attacker tries to send a large amount of tokens to a contract, the contract will not be able to handle the transaction and will fail.

The `withdraw` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `withdraw` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(amount)`, which allows an attacker to potentially call the contract again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:** This creates a reentrancy vulnerability, as the attacker can repeatedly call the `withdraw` function to drain the contract's funds.
