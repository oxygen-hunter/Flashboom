The `WithdrawToHolder` function in the `TokenBank` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls `_addr.call.value(_wei)` which is a low-level call. This means that the contract doesn't have a way to handle the potential for a reentrancy attack. 
* **Potential for Exploitation:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times in rapid succession, potentially draining funds from the contract. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The contract lacks any safeguards to prevent a reentrancy attack.

The `proxy` function in the `DepositProxy` contract allows arbitrary code execution. This is a major security vulnerability. 

Here's why:

* **Unrestricted Execution:** The `proxy` function doesn't have any checks on the `data` parameter. This means an attacker could send malicious data to the `proxy` function, potentially executing arbitrary code.
* **Potential for Code Injection:**  The `proxy` function's `data` parameter is directly passed to the target contract. This allows an attacker to inject their own code into the target contract, potentially leading to a full compromise of the contract. 
* **Lack of Context:** The `proxy` function doesn't provide any context about the target contract. This makes it difficult to understand what the target contract is doing and how the `proxy` function interacts with it.
