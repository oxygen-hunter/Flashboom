The code has several vulnerabilities:

* **Unchecked Return Values:** The `claimThrone` function doesn't check the return value of `msg.sender.send(valuePaid)`, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
* **Low Level Function Calls:** The `send` function is a low-level function that doesn't propagate errors. This means that if it fails, the contract execution will continue without stopping. 
* **Reentrancy Attacks:** The `claimThrone` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
* **Arithmetic Overflows and Underflows:** The code doesn't handle arithmetic overflows and underflows well. 
* **Access Control Vulnerabilities:** The `transferOwnership` function is vulnerable to access control vulnerabilities. 
* **Timestamp Dependence:** The `claimThrone` function relies on the block timestamp for critical functionality, which can be manipulated by miners. 
* **Unclear Logic:** The code is not well-structured and lacks clear logic, making it difficult to understand and identify potential vulnerabilities.

The `Command` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unrestricted External Calls:** The `Command` function allows external contracts to call functions on the contract.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `if` statement allows the contract to call an external contract (`msg.sender.call.value(_am)`) before the `Collect` function completes.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This external call can be exploited by an attacker to call the `Collect` function again and again, draining the contract's funds.
