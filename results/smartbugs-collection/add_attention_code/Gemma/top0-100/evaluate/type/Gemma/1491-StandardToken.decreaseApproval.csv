The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which allows an attacker to potentially call the contract again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Reentrancy:** This creates a reentrancy vulnerability because the contract's state can be changed in the middle of its execution.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `call.value(_am)` function allows the contract to execute arbitrary code on the sender's behalf. This means an attacker could potentially call the `Collect` function multiple times within a short period, draining the contract's funds.
