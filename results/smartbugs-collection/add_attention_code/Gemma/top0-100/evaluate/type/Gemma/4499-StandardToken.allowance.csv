The code has several vulnerabilities:

* **Unchecked Return Values:** The `claimThrone` function doesn't check the return value of `msg.sender.send(valuePaid)`, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
* **Low Level Function Calls:** The `send` function is a low-level function that doesn't propagate errors. This means that if it fails, the contract won't revert.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which allows an attacker to potentially call the contract again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Reentrancy:** This creates a reentrancy vulnerability because the contract's state can be changed in the middle of its execution.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **Unrestricted External Calls:** The `Collect` function allows external calls to be made within the contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `Collect` multiple times within a short period, potentially draining funds.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `Collect` function doesn't handle the external contract call's return value. This means an attacker could potentially call the `Collect` function multiple times in a row, draining the contract's funds.

The contract has a potential Denial of Service vulnerability. 

Here's why:

* **Infinite Loop:** The `insertNnumbers` function has a potential for an infinite loop.  The `if` statement checks if the array length is equal to the current `numElements`. If it is, the `array.length += 1` statement is executed. This could lead to an infinite loop if the `numbers` parameter is large enough. 
* **Resource Exhaustion:** The `clear` function can cause resource exhaustion. The `clearDOS` function can cause the contract to run out of gas and fail.
