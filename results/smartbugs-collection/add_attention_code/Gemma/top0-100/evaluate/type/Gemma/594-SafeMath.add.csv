The `add` function is vulnerable because it doesn't handle overflow errors.  The `require` statement ensures that the result of the addition is greater than or equal to the input values.

 The code has several vulnerabilities related to the `send` function.  Here's why:

* **`msg.sender.send(valuePaid)`:** This line sends the `valuePaid` to the `msg.sender` address.  This is a potential vulnerability because it doesn't check for the return value of the `send` function. If the `send` function fails, the contract will continue to execute, potentially leading to unexpected outcomes. 
* **`msg.sender.send(excessPaid)`:**  Similar to the previous vulnerability, this line sends the `excessPaid` to the `msg.sender` address. 
* **`currentMonarch.etherAddress.send(compensation)`:** This line sends the `compensation` to the `currentMonarch.etherAddress`.  This is a potential vulnerability because it doesn't check for the return value of the `send` function. If the `send` function fails, the contract will continue to execute, potentially leading to unexpected outcomes.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This call allows an attacker to potentially call the `Collect` function repeatedly, draining the contract's funds. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The code lacks any safeguards to prevent this type of attack.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which allows an attacker to potentially call the contract again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Reentrancy:** This creates a reentrancy vulnerability because the contract's state can be altered in the middle of its execution.

The `add` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  The `require` statement in the `add` function ensures that the result of the addition is greater than or equal to the input. However, if an attacker calls the `withdraw` function before the `add` function completes, the attacker can potentially manipulate the `add` function's return value.
