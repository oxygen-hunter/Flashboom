The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is an external call. This means the contract can be called again before the initial execution is complete.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `if` statement checks for a condition, but it doesn't prevent the contract from being called again before the initial execution is complete.
