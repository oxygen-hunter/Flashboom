The code uses ` SafeMath` library, which is a common practice to prevent integer overflows and underflows. However, the code still has potential vulnerabilities. 

Here's why:

* **Arithmetic Operations:** The contract uses arithmetic operations like addition, multiplication, and subtraction. These operations can lead to overflows or underflows if not handled correctly.
* **Unrestricted Access:** The contract allows for external contracts to interact with it. This can create vulnerabilities if the external contracts are not properly audited. 
* **Lack of Context:** The code lacks context about the specific use case of the contract. This makes it difficult to determine if the operations are appropriate for the intended functionality.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Reentrancy:**  This call to an external contract can be re-entered by the attacker, leading to a potential reentrancy attack.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `call.value(_am)` function allows the contract to execute arbitrary code on the sender's behalf. This means an attacker could potentially call the `Collect` function multiple times, draining the contract's funds.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls an external contract (`_addr.call.value(_wei)`) which is a potential point of vulnerability.
* **Reentrancy:**  The attacker can call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time before the previous one has finished executing. This creates a loop where the contract is repeatedly called, draining funds.

The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `CashOut` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 
* **Unclear Execution:** The code doesn't specify how the `call.value(_am)` function is executed. This leaves room for an attacker to potentially execute malicious code within the contract.
