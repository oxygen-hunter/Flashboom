The `transferFrom` function in the `StandardToken` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  A reentrancy attack occurs when an attacker calls a contract's function multiple times in rapid succession, potentially draining funds.
* **Vulnerability:** The `transferFrom` function doesn't have any checks to prevent this. 
* **Example:** An attacker could call `transferFrom` repeatedly, each time before the previous one resolves, to drain funds.

* **Unprotected Access:** The `transferOwnership` function is not restricted to specific addresses. This can be exploited by malicious actors. 
* **Reentrancy:** The `claimThrone` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
* **Arithmetic Overflows:** The code does not handle arithmetic overflows and underflows well. 
* **Timestamp Dependence:** The `claimThrone` function uses the block timestamp for critical functionality. This can be manipulated by miners.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:**  This call to an external contract can be exploited by an attacker. The attacker can call the `Collect` function repeatedly, potentially draining the contract's funds.
