The `transferFrom` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Low-Level Calls:** The `transferFrom` function uses `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)`. This means it executes a call to the specified address (`adr`) with the specified value (`msg.value`) and data (`data`).
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:**  The `transferFrom` function doesn't handle reentrancy. If an attacker can call the `transferFrom` function multiple times in a short time, they can potentially drain the contract's funds.
