The `increaseApproval` function in the `StandardToken` contract allows for the allowance of tokens to be increased. This function is vulnerable to integer overflows. 

Here's why:

* **Overflow Potential:** The `add` function in the `SafeMath` library uses a simple addition operation. If the `_addedValue` is very large, it could exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a `uint256` variable. 
* **Impact:** This overflow could lead to an underflow, where the `allowed` mapping becomes corrupted, potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate the contract's state.
