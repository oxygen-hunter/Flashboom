The `burnSome` function in the `BasicMultiToken` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

This creates a loop where the `ERC20` tokens are being transferred again and again.  This can lead to a reentrancy attack.

* **Reentrancy:**  The `burnSome` function allows for the transfer of tokens from one address to another.  The function does not check for reentrancy, which means an attacker could call the function multiple times in a row.
* **Potential for Loss:**  If an attacker can repeatedly call the `burnSome` function, they could drain the contract of its funds.
