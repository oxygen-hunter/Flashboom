The `allowance` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  A reentrancy attack occurs when a malicious contract calls a function within a contract that is still executing. 
* **Vulnerability:** The `allowance` function doesn't handle reentrancy. If an attacker can call the `allowance` function multiple times, they can potentially drain the contract's funds.

* **Low Level Function Calls:** The `send` function is a low-level function that doesn't propagate errors. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploits.
* **Unrestricted Access:** The `transferOwnership` function allows anyone to change the contract's owner. This can be exploited to gain control of the contract. 
* **Unclear Ownership:** The contract doesn't clearly define who owns the contract. This can lead to confusion and potential exploits. 
* **Lack of Error Handling:** The contract doesn't handle errors gracefully. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploits. 
* **Potential Reentrancy:** The `claimThrone` function could be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

The contract uses a mapping called `allowed` which allows for the setting of an allowance for a specific spender. This mapping is used to determine the amount of tokens that an owner allows a spender to access.  This mapping is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `Collect` function doesn't handle the external contract call's return value. This means an attacker could potentially call the `Collect` function multiple times in rapid succession, draining the contract's funds.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:
