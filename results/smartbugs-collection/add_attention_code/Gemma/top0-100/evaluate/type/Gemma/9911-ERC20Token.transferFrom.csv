The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unprotected External Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls `_addr.call.value(_wei)()` which is an external call. This means the contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time before the previous one has completed. This could lead to a reentrancy attack, where the contract's state is manipulated.
