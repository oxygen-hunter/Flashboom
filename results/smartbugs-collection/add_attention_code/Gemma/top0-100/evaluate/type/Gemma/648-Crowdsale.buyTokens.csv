The `transfer` function in the `AirDropContract` is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled External Calls:** The `transfer` function calls `contract_address.call(id, msg.sender, tos[i], vs[i])` which is a low-level call. This means the contract doesn't have any control over the execution of the external contract.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unprotected External Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls `_addr.call.value(_wei)()` which is a direct call to an external address. This means an attacker could potentially call the function multiple times in a row, leading to a reentrancy attack. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The function doesn't include any checks to prevent the attacker from calling the function repeatedly.

Here's why:

* **Line 46: `creditorAddresses = new address[](0);`**  and **Line 48: `creditorAmounts = new uint[](0);`**  These lines create arrays that are initialized to be empty. This means that if a malicious actor sends a large amount of ETH to the contract, the contract will be unable to process it. 
* **Line 46 and 48 are the only lines that are vulnerable.** 
* **The vulnerability lies in the fact that the arrays are initialized to be empty.** 
* **This can lead to a denial of service attack.**
