The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unrestricted External Calls:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function allows external calls to the contract's `Withdraw` function.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time attempting to drain funds from the contract. 
* **No Safeguards:** The function doesn't include any safeguards to prevent this type of attack.

The contract uses a `supportsToken` function that calls the `airDrop` function of the `ModifierEntrancy` contract. This creates a reentrancy vulnerability because the `airDrop` function can be called repeatedly before the initial execution is complete.

The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `CashOut` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a direct call to the sender's address.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `call.value(_am)` function can be exploited by an attacker to call the `CashOut` function again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The attacker can potentially drain the contract's funds by repeatedly calling the `CashOut` function.
