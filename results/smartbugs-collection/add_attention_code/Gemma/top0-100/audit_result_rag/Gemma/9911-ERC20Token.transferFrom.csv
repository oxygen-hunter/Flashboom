The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unprotected External Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls `_addr.call.value(_wei)()` which is an external call. This means the contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time before the previous one has completed. This could lead to a reentrancy attack, where the contract's state is manipulated.

The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `CashOut` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a direct call to the sender's address.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `call.value(_am)` function can be exploited by an attacker to call the `CashOut` function again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** This allows the attacker to drain funds from the contract.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `CashOut` function.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `CashOut` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which allows an attacker to potentially call the contract again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Reentrancy:** This creates a reentrancy vulnerability because the contract's state can be changed in the middle of its execution.
