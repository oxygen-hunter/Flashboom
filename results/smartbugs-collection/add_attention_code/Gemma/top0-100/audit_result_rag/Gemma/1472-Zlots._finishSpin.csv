The contract uses a function called `_finishSpin` which is vulnerable to denial of service attacks.  The function has a `_finishSpin` function that takes an address as input and uses a random number generator to determine the outcome of the spin.  The function then uses the random number to determine the outcome of the spin.  This function is vulnerable to denial of service attacks because it can be used to drain the contract of funds.
