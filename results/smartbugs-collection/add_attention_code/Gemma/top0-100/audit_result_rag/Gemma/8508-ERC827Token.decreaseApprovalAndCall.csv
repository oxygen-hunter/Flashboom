Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  A reentrancy attack occurs when an attacker calls a contract function multiple times within a short time frame, potentially draining funds.
* **`caddress.call`:** This function executes the provided `id` (a bytecode call) on the `caddress` contract.

This means that the random number generated by the contract is not truly random, and attackers can exploit this to manipulate the outcome of the raffle.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `Collect` function doesn't explicitly check for reentrancy. If an attacker calls `Collect` multiple times in rapid succession, they could potentially drain the contract's funds.
