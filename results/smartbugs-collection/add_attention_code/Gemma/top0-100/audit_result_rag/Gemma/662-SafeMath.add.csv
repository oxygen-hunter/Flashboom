The `add` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `add` function uses `msg.sender.call.value(oCredit)`, which allows an attacker to call the contract's `withdrawAll` function before the `add` function completes. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `withdrawAll` function could be designed to call the `add` function again, leading to a chain of calls that drain the contract's funds.

The contract uses the `add` function, which is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  The `add` function is not a pure function, and it can be called from an external contract. This means that an attacker could call the `add` function from an external contract before the `transfer` function is complete, leading to a reentrancy attack.

The contract has a vulnerability that could lead to a Denial of Service attack. 

Here's why:

* **Excessive Function Calls:** The `ifillArray` function repeatedly adds the `msg.sender` to the `listAddresses` array. This can lead to a Denial of Service attack if the `listAddresses` array is not properly sized. 
* **Potential for Looping:** The `ifillArray` function uses a loop that could potentially run indefinitely, leading to a Denial of Service attack. 
* **Resource Exhaustion:** The `add` function could potentially lead to resource exhaustion if the `listAddresses` array is not properly sized.
