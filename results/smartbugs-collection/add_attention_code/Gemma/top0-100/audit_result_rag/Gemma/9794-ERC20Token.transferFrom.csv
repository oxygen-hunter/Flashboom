The `Command` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unrestricted External Calls:** The `Command` function allows external contracts to call functions on the contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `Command` multiple times, each time with a different `adr` and `data`.  This could lead to a reentrancy attack, where the contract executes the external contract's code repeatedly, potentially draining funds. 

**Example Attack:**

1. **Initial Call:** An attacker calls `Command` with a malicious address (`adr`) and data.
2. **Reentrancy:** The `Command` function executes the external contract's code.
3. **Repeat Calls:** The attacker then calls `Command` again, potentially with a different `adr` and data.
4. **Reentrancy:** The external contract's code is executed again, potentially leading to a loss of funds. 


**Mitigation:**

* **Restrict External Calls:**  Limit the `Command` function to only allow calls from the contract's owner.
* **Implement Reentrancy Guard:**  Use a reentrancy guard to prevent the contract from executing the external contract's code multiple times.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unprotected External Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls `_addr.call.value(_wei)()` which is an external call. This means the contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time before the previous one has completed. This could lead to a reentrancy attack, where the contract's state is manipulated.

* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `call.value(_am)` function can be exploited by an attacker to call the `CashOut` function again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** This allows the attacker to drain funds from the contract.

The contract uses the `transferFrom` function, which is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  The `transferFrom` function allows for the transfer of tokens from one address to another.
