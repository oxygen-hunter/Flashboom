The contract uses the `call.value` function, which allows external contracts to call functions within the contract. This can be exploited by a malicious actor to call the `transfer` function repeatedly, draining the contract of funds.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `CashOut` function.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `CashOut` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `call.value(_am)` function allows the contract to execute arbitrary code on the `msg.sender` address. This means an attacker could potentially call the `CashOut` function multiple times within a short period, draining the contract's funds.
