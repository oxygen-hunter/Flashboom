The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract. 
* **Reentrancy:** This allows an attacker to call the `Collect` function repeatedly, draining the contract's funds. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The code doesn't have any safeguards to prevent this type of attack.
