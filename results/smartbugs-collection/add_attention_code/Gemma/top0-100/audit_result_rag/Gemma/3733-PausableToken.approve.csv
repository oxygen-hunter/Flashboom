The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `if` statement calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The code doesn't handle the potential for a malicious contract to call the `Collect` function multiple times before the initial execution is complete.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unprotected External Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls `_addr.call.value(_wei)()` which is an external call. This means the contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
* **No Locking:** The contract does not lock the funds before the external call. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:** An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time before the previous one resolves.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `CashOut` function.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `CashOut` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which allows an attacker to potentially call the contract again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Reentrancy:** This creates a reentrancy vulnerability because the contract's state can be changed in the middle of its execution.
