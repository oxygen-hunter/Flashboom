The `Command` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `Command` function allows the `adr` to call any function on the contract. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `Command` multiple times, potentially leading to a reentrancy attack. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The contract lacks any checks to prevent the `Command` function from being called repeatedly.

The code has several vulnerabilities:

* **Unchecked Return Values:** The `claimThrone` function returns a boolean value, but it doesn't check if the return value is true or false. This can lead to unexpected behavior.
* **Low Level Function Calls:** The `claimThrone` function uses `msg.sender.send(valuePaid)` and `msg.sender.send(excessPaid)`. These functions are low level and can lead to unexpected behavior. 
* **Unprotected Access:** The `transferOwnership` function allows anyone to change the contract's owner. This is a security vulnerability. 
* **Reentrancy:** The `claimThrone` function could be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
* **Arithmetic Overflows:** The code does not handle arithmetic overflows and underflows well. 
* **Timestamp Dependence:** The `claimThrone` function uses the block timestamp for critical functionality. This can be manipulated by miners.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unprotected External Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls `_addr.call.value(_wei)()` which is a direct call to the recipient's contract. This means an attacker could potentially call the function multiple times in a row, leading to a reentrancy attack. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The function doesn't include any checks to prevent the attacker from calling the function repeatedly.
