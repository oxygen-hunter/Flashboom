The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `CashOut` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `call.value(_am)` function allows the contract to execute arbitrary code on the `msg.sender` address. This means an attacker could potentially call the `CashOut` function multiple times within a short period, draining the contract's funds.

The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `CashOut` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a direct call to the sender's address.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This call could be exploited by an attacker to call the `CashOut` function again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `call.value(_am)` function doesn't have any checks to prevent the attacker from calling the function multiple times.

The contract's `insertNnumbers` function is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.  Here's why:

* **Infinite Loop:** The `for` loop in `insertNnumbers` has no termination condition. It will continue to execute indefinitely, consuming resources and potentially causing the contract to become unresponsive. 
* **Resource Exhaustion:** The `insertNnumbers` function uses `array.length += 1` to dynamically grow the array. This can lead to a situation where the array size exceeds the available memory, causing a crash or a denial of service.
