The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unprotected External Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls `_addr.call.value(_wei)()` which is an external call. This means the contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times in rapid succession, potentially draining funds from the contract. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The contract lacks any safeguards to prevent multiple calls to `WithdrawToHolder` from the same address.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unrestricted External Calls:** The `Collect` function allows external calls to be made to the contract's `msg.sender` address.
