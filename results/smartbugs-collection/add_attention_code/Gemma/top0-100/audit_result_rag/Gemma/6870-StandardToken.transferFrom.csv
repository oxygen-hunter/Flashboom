The `transferFrom` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  A reentrancy attack occurs when a malicious actor calls a contract's function multiple times within a short timeframe, exploiting the contract's internal logic. 
* **The Vulnerability:** The `transferFrom` function allows for the transfer of funds from one address to another.  If an attacker can call this function repeatedly, they can potentially drain the funds from the contract.

The `transferFrom` function introduces a potential reentrancy vulnerability.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  A reentrancy attack occurs when an attacker calls a contract function multiple times within a short timeframe, exploiting the contract's execution flow. 
* **Vulnerability:** The `transferFrom` function allows for the transfer of tokens from one address to another.  If an attacker can call this function repeatedly, they can potentially drain the funds from the contract. 
* **Solution:**  Implement a mechanism to prevent reentrancy, such as a locking mechanism or a state change that prevents the function from being called again until the previous call has completed.
