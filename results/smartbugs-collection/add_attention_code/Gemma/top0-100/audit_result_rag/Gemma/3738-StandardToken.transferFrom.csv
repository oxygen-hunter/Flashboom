The contract uses `keccak256` to generate the `answer` which is a random number. However, the `keccak256` function is deterministic.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `Collect` function doesn't explicitly check for reentrancy. If an attacker calls `Collect` multiple times in rapid succession, they could potentially drain the contract's funds.
