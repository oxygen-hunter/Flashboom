The `allowance` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  A reentrancy attack occurs when a malicious contract calls a function within itself, potentially leading to unintended consequences.
* **Vulnerability:** The `allowance` function doesn't explicitly check for reentrancy. If an attacker can call the `Command` function multiple times, they could potentially drain the contract's funds. 
* **Example:** An attacker could call `Command` with a malicious payload that calls `allowance` repeatedly, draining the contract's funds.

* **Low Level Function Calls:** The `send` function can fail, and the code doesn't handle this.

The `airDrop` function in the `ModifierEntrancy` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `airDrop` function calls `ModifierEntrancy(msg.sender).airDrop()` which means it can be called repeatedly.
* **No Locking:** The `airDrop` function does not have any locking mechanisms to prevent multiple calls. 
* **Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `airDrop` repeatedly, potentially draining the contract's funds.

The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `CashOut` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which allows an attacker to call the contract again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This creates a window for an attacker to repeatedly call the `CashOut` function, draining the contract's funds.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a potential reentrancy attack. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `call.value(_am)` function allows the contract to execute arbitrary code on the `msg.sender` address. This means an attacker could potentially call the `Collect` function multiple times within the same transaction, draining the contract's funds.

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which allows an attacker to potentially call the contract again before the initial execution is complete.
