The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls an external contract (`_addr.call.value(_wei)`) before the `WithdrawToHolder` function completes. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time before the previous one has finished, potentially draining funds.

The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `CashOut` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This call to an external contract could be re-entered by the attacker, leading to a re-execution of the `CashOut` function. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The attacker could potentially manipulate the contract's state and drain funds.
