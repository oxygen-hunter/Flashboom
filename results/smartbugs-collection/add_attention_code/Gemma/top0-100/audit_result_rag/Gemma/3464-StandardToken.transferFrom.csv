The `transferFrom` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  A reentrancy attack occurs when a malicious contract calls a function within itself repeatedly, potentially draining funds.
* **The `transferFrom` function:**  This function involves transferring funds from one address to another.  
* **Vulnerability:**  The `transferFrom` function doesn't have any built-in safeguards against reentrancy.  A malicious contract could call `transferFrom` multiple times within a short period, potentially draining funds.

* **Vulnerability:** The `transferFrom` function allows for the transfer of tokens from one address to another.  If an attacker can call this function multiple times within a short time frame, they can potentially drain the funds from the contract.
