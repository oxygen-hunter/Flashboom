The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unrestricted External Calls:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function allows external calls to the contract's `Withdraw` function.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time attempting to drain funds from the contract. 
* **No Safeguards:** The contract lacks any safeguards to prevent this type of attack.

The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `CashOut` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a direct call to the sender's address.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `CashOut` multiple times in rapid succession, potentially draining the contract's funds. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The code lacks any checks to prevent multiple calls or to ensure the `_am` value is not greater than the remaining balance.
