The `burnSome` function in the `BasicMultiToken` contract allows for the burning of tokens from the contract. This function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:** The `burnSome` function calls `callee.delegatecall(_data)` which can be exploited by an attacker. 
* **Potential for Manipulation:** The `burnSome` function doesn't have any checks to prevent an attacker from calling it repeatedly. 
* **Unintended Consequences:** The `burnSome` function could lead to unintended consequences, such as a loss of funds or a change in the contract's state.

* **Unchecked Return Values:** The `claimThrone` function returns a boolean value, but it doesn't check if the return value is true or false. This can lead to unexpected behavior.
