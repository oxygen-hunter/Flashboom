The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract. 
* **Reentrancy:** This allows an attacker to call the `Collect` function repeatedly, potentially draining the contract's funds. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `Collect` function doesn't have proper checks to prevent this.
