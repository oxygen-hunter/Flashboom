The `transferFrom` function in the `StandardToken` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  A reentrancy attack occurs when a malicious contract calls a function within a contract that is still executing a transaction. 
* **Vulnerability:** The `transferFrom` function allows for the transfer of tokens from one address to another. If an attacker can call the `transferFrom` function multiple times within a short time frame, they can potentially drain the funds from the contract. 
* **Example:** An attacker could call `transferFrom` repeatedly, each time before the previous one resolves, effectively draining the funds.

The contract uses the `transferFrom` function, which allows users to transfer tokens from one address to another. However, the `transferFrom` function does not have any checks to ensure that the sender has enough tokens to transfer.
