The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:**  This call to an external contract can be exploited by an attacker. The attacker can call the `Collect` function repeatedly, potentially draining the contract's funds. 


Let me know if you'd like a more detailed explanation of how this vulnerability works.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unrestricted External Calls:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function allows external calls to the contract's `Withdraw` function.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time before the previous one resolves. This creates a loop where the contract's state is constantly changing, leading to a reentrancy attack.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:
