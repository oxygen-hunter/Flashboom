The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a direct call to the sender's contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `Collect` function doesn't have any checks to prevent the external contract from calling itself again before the initial execution is complete.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This call to an external contract could be re-entered by the attacker, leading to a reentrancy attack.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which allows an attacker to potentially call the contract again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Reentrancy:** This creates a reentrancy vulnerability because the contract's state can be changed in the middle of its execution.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls an external contract (`_addr.call.value(_wei)`) before the `WithdrawToHolder` function is complete. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time before the previous one resolves, potentially draining funds.
