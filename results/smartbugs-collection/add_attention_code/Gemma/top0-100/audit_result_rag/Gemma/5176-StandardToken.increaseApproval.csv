The `withdrawAll` function allows an attacker to call the `call.value(oCredit)` function before the initial execution is complete. This is a classic reentrancy attack.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `CashOut` function.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `CashOut` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which allows an attacker to potentially call the contract again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Reentrancy:** This creates a reentrancy vulnerability because the contract's state can be changed in the middle of its execution.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This call to an external contract could be re-entered by the attacker, leading to a re-entrancy attack. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `Collect` function doesn't have any checks to prevent the attacker from repeatedly calling the function.

117,reentrancy,"YES
 
The contract uses the `call.value` function, which allows external contracts to call functions on the contract. This can be exploited by a malicious actor to call the `transfer` function multiple times, draining the contract of funds.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **Unrestricted External Calls:** The `Collect` function allows external calls to be made within the contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `Collect` multiple times within a short period, potentially draining the contract's funds. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The code doesn't have any safeguards to prevent this type of attack.
