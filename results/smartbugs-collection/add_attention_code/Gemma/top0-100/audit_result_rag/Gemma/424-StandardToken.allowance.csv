The `allowance` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  A reentrancy attack occurs when a malicious contract calls a function within a contract that is still executing.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **Unrestricted External Calls:** The `Collect` function allows external calls to be made within the contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `Collect` multiple times within a short period, potentially draining the contract's funds. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The code doesn't have any safeguards to prevent this type of attack.
