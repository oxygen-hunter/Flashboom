The `withdrawTokens` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `withdrawTokens` function calls an external contract (`dreamToken`) using `transfer(address,uint256)`. This means the contract can potentially execute code before the initial execution is complete.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `withdrawTokens` multiple times in rapid succession, potentially leading to a reentrancy attack.

The `airDrop` function in the `ModifierEntrancy` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unrestricted External Calls:** The `airDrop` function allows external contracts to call it before it completes its execution. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `airDrop` multiple times within a short period, potentially draining the contract's funds. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The `airDrop` function doesn't have any safeguards to prevent this type of attack.
