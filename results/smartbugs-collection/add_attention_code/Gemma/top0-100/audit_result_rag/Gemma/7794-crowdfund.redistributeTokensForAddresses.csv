The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled External Calls:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function allows external calls to the contract's `Withdraw` function.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time before the previous one resolves. This creates a loop where the contract's state is constantly changing, potentially leading to a reentrancy attack.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled External Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which allows an attacker to potentially call the contract again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Reentrancy Attack:** This creates a reentrancy attack, where an attacker can repeatedly call the `Collect` function to drain funds from the contract.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is an external contract call. This means the contract can be called again before the initial execution is complete.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The attacker can call `Collect` multiple times, potentially draining the contract's funds.
