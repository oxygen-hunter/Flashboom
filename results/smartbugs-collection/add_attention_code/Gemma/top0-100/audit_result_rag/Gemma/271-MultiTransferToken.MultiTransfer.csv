The `withdraw` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `withdraw` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(amount)`, which allows an attacker to potentially call the contract again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:** This creates a reentrancy vulnerability because the contract's state can be altered in the middle of its execution.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unprotected External Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls `_addr.call.value(_wei)()` which is a direct call to the external address. This means an attacker could potentially call the function multiple times in a row, leading to a reentrancy attack. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The function doesn't include any checks to prevent the attacker from calling the function repeatedly.

The code you provided has a vulnerability related to the `lendGovernmentMoney` function.  The line `creditorAddresses = new address[](0);` and `creditorAmounts = new uint[](0);`  are vulnerable to denial of service attacks. 

Here's why:

* **Memory Leak:**  These lines create arrays that are not explicitly cleared. If an attacker can repeatedly call `lendGovernmentMoney` with large amounts, they could potentially exhaust the contract's memory.
* **Denial of Service:**  This can lead to a denial of service attack, where the contract becomes unresponsive to legitimate transactions.
