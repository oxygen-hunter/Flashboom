The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is an external call. This means the contract can be called again before the initial execution is complete.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `if` statement checks for a condition, but the external call could be executed multiple times before the condition is met.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls an external contract (`_addr.call.value(_wei)`) before the `WithdrawToHolder` function is complete. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times in rapid succession, potentially draining funds from the contract.

The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `CashOut` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `call.value(_am)` function allows the contract to execute arbitrary code on the `msg.sender` address. This means an attacker could potentially call the `CashOut` function multiple times within a short period, draining the contract's funds.
