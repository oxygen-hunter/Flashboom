The `withdraw` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `withdraw` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(amount)`, which allows an attacker to potentially call the contract again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:** This creates a reentrancy vulnerability, as the attacker can repeatedly call the `withdraw` function to drain the contract's funds.

The `withdrawTokens` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `withdrawTokens` function calls an external contract (`dreamToken`) to transfer tokens.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `withdrawTokens` multiple times in rapid succession, potentially leading to a reentrancy attack. 
* **Unprotected Transfer:** The `withdrawTokens` function doesn't have any checks to prevent the attacker from calling it repeatedly.
