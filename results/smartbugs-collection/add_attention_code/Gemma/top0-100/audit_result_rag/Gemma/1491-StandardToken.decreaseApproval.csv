The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:**  This call to an external contract can be exploited by an attacker. The attacker can call the `Collect` function repeatedly, draining the contract's funds.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which allows an attacker to potentially call the contract again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Reentrancy:** This creates a reentrancy vulnerability because the contract's state can be changed in the middle of its execution.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls an external contract (`_addr.call.value(_wei)`) before the `WithdrawToHolder` function completes. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time before the previous one has finished, potentially draining funds.
