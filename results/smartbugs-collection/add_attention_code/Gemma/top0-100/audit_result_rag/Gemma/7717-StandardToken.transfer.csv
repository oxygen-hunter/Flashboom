The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `if` statement allows the `Collect` function to call an external contract (`msg.sender.call.value(_am)`) before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:** This creates a window for an attacker to call the `Collect` function multiple times, draining the contract's funds.

134,denial of service,"YES
 
The contract's `insertNnumbers` function is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.  Here's why:

* **Infinite Loop:** The `for` loop in `insertNnumbers` has no termination condition. It will continue to execute indefinitely, consuming resources and potentially causing the contract to become unresponsive. 
* **Resource Exhaustion:** The `insertNnumbers` function uses `array.length += 1` to dynamically grow the array. This can lead to a situation where the array size exceeds the available memory, causing a crash or a denial of service.

The contract uses `require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));` which is vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks.  This line is susceptible to a denial of service attack because it relies on the `send` function of the `refundAddresses` array. If the `send` function fails, the contract will be unable to complete the refund operation.
