The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **Unrestricted External Calls:** The `Collect` function allows external calls to be made within the contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `Collect` multiple times within a short period, potentially draining the contract's funds. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The code doesn't have any mechanisms to prevent or detect repeated calls to `Collect`.

The contract has a potential Denial of Service vulnerability. 

Here's why:

If it is, the `array.length += 1` statement is executed. This could lead to an infinite loop if the `numbers` parameter is large enough.

The contract has a vulnerability that allows for denial of service attacks.

* **Potential for Looping:** The `ifillArray` function uses a loop that could potentially run indefinitely, leading to a denial of service attack. 
* **Resource Exhaustion:** The `ifillArray` function could potentially exhaust the contract's gas limit, leading to a denial of service attack.
