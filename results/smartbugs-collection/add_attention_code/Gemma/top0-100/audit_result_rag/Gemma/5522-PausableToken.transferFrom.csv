* **Vulnerability:** The `transferFrom` function doesn't have any checks to prevent this. 
* **Example:** An attacker could call `transferFrom` repeatedly, each time before the previous one resolves, to drain funds.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:**  This call to an external contract can be exploited by an attacker. The attacker can call the `Collect` function repeatedly, potentially draining the contract's funds.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unprotected External Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls `_addr.call.value(_wei)()` which is a direct call to an external address. This means an attacker could potentially call the function multiple times in a row, draining the contract's funds. 
* **No Locking Mechanism:** The function doesn't have any locking mechanism to prevent multiple calls from the same address.

The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unrestricted External Calls:** The `CashOut` function allows external calls to the contract's `msg.sender` address.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `CashOut` multiple times within a short period, potentially draining the contract's funds. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The code lacks any checks to prevent multiple calls or to ensure that the `msg.sender` address has sufficient funds.
