* **Infinite Loops:** The `_finishBet` function could potentially create an infinite loop if the random number generation is not properly controlled. This would consume all the contract's gas and make it unavailable for other transactions. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `_finishBet` function has access to the contract's balance and can potentially manipulate it. This could be exploited to drain the contract of funds.
