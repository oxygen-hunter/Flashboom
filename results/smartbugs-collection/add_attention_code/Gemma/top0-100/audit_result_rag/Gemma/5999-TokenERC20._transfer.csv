The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `call.value(_am)` function allows an attacker to call the contract again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:** This creates a reentrancy vulnerability, as the attacker can repeatedly call the `Collect` function to drain the contract's funds.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unrestricted External Calls:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function allows external calls to the contract's `Withdraw` function.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time attempting to drain funds from the contract.

The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `CashOut` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `call.value(_am)` function allows the contract to execute arbitrary code on the `msg.sender` address. This means an attacker could potentially call the `CashOut` function multiple times within a short period, draining the contract's funds.

* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:**  The `call.value(_am)` function call is susceptible to reentrancy because it doesn't handle the potential for a malicious contract to call the `CashOut` function multiple times.
