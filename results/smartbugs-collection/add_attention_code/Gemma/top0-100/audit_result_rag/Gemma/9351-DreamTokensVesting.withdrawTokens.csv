The `sendTokens` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  A reentrancy attack occurs when a malicious contract calls a function within itself, potentially leading to unintended consequences.
* **Vulnerability:** The `sendTokens` function doesn't have any explicit checks to prevent reentrancy.  A malicious contract could call `sendTokens` multiple times in rapid succession, potentially draining the contract's funds.
