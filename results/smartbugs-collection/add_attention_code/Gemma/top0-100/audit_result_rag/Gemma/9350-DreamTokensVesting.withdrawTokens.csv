The `withdrawTokens` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `withdrawTokens` function calls an external contract (`dreamToken`) using `transfer(address,uint256)`. This means the contract can potentially execute code before the initial execution is complete.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `withdrawTokens` multiple times in rapid succession, potentially leading to a reentrancy attack.
