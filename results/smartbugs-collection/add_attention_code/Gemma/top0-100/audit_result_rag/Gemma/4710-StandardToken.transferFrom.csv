The `Command` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `Command` function allows the `Owner` to call any function on the contract, including external contracts. 
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:**  An attacker could call `Command` multiple times, each time with a different function and potentially malicious data. This could lead to a reentrancy attack, where the contract is tricked into executing the attacker's malicious code. 
 
**Example Attack:**

1. **Initial Call:** The attacker calls `Command` with a malicious function and data.
2. **Reentrancy:** The `Command` function executes the attacker's malicious code.
3. **Repeat Calls:** The attacker then calls `Command` again, potentially with a different malicious function and data. 
4. **Exploitation:** The attacker's malicious code is executed repeatedly, draining the contract's funds. 


**Mitigation:**

* **Restrict `Command`:**  Limit the `Command` function to only allow calls from the `Owner` address.
* **Use `require`:**  Implement `require` statements to ensure that the `Command` function only executes with valid data and addresses. 
* **Implement a Safeguard:**  Consider using a safe function to execute external contracts.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unprotected External Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls `_addr.call.value(_wei)()` which is a direct call to an external address. This means an attacker could potentially call the function multiple times in a row, draining the contract's funds. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The function doesn't include any checks to prevent reentrancy.

* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `call.value(_am)` function can be exploited by an attacker to call the `CashOut` function again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** This allows the attacker to drain funds from the contract.
