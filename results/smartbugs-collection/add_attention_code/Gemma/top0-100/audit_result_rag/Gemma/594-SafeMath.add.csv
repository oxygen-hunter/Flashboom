 The code has several vulnerabilities related to the `send` function.  Here's why:

* **`msg.sender.send(valuePaid)`:** This line sends the `valuePaid` to the `msg.sender` address.  This is a potential vulnerability because it doesn't check for the return value of the `send` function. If the `send` function fails, the contract will continue to execute, potentially leading to unexpected outcomes. 
* **`msg.sender.send(excessPaid)`:**  Similar to the previous vulnerability, this line sends the `excessPaid` to the `msg.sender` address.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This call allows an attacker to potentially call the `Collect` function again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The code doesn't handle the potential for multiple calls to `Collect` to drain funds.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `Collect` function doesn't handle the external contract call's return value. This means an attacker could potentially call the `Collect` function multiple times within a short period, draining the contract's funds.

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which allows an attacker to call the contract again before the initial execution is complete.

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which allows an attacker to potentially call the contract again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Reentrancy:** This creates a reentrancy vulnerability because the contract's state can be changed in the middle of its execution.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls an external contract (`_addr`) with the `_wei` value. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `WithdrawToHolder` function doesn't explicitly check for reentrancy. If an attacker can call the `WithdrawToHolder` function multiple times, they could potentially drain the contract's funds.

The `airDrop` function in the `ModifierEntrancy` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `airDrop` function calls `ModifierEntrancy(msg.sender).airDrop()` which means it can be called repeatedly.
* **No Locking:** The `airDrop` function does not have any locking mechanisms to prevent multiple calls.
