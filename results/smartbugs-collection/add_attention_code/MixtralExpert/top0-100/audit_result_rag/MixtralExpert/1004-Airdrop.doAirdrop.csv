11,access control," Yes, the smart contract code is vulnerable due to potential reentrancy attack in the Airdrop contract. In the `doAirdrop` function, it calls the `transferFrom` function of the ERC20 contract in a loop without checking the balance before each transfer. An attacker could potentially manipulate the balance of the ERC20 token to cause a reentrancy attack. Additionally, the `doAirdrop` function does not check the `msg.sender`'s allowance of the ERC20 token before transferring, which could also lead to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the `doAirdrop` function should check the balance of the ERC20 token before each transfer and also check the `msg.sender`'s allowance before transferring. The function could also implement a reentrancy guard to prevent attackers from calling the function recursively.",951,196,20.80919647216797
12,access control," Yes, the second smart contract code is also vulnerable due to the same reason as the first one. The `missing()` function in the `Missing` contract does not have the `onlyowner` modifier, which means any address can call this function and set the `owner` variable.

13,access control," NO, the contract is not vulnerable at this particular line. The vulnerability in the `DynamicPyramid()` function is that it does not use the `onlyowner` modifier, allowing any caller to set the `creator` variable. However, the `onlyowner` modifier is used correctly in later functions that modify the contract state, so the vulnerability lies in the fact that any caller can become the `creator`, not specifically in this line.

The rest of the contract seems to have proper access controls in place, with the `onlyowner` modifier used correctly for functions that modify the contract state. However, I would still recommend renaming the `DynamicPyramid()` function to something like `initialize()` and adding the `onlyowner` modifier to it, to make it clear that it sets the `creator` variable and prevent unauthorized access.",3215,186,20.551795959472656
14,access control," Answer:

Yes, the first contract code is vulnerable to an access control vulnerability. The 'withdraw' function in the Wallet contract does not check if the msg.sender has sufficient balance before transferring the amount. This can allow any user to withdraw more tokens than they have in their balance, leading to a security issue.

The second contract code is not vulnerable based on the provided code. However, it is important to note that the 'doAirdrop' function in the Airdrop contract calls the 'transferFrom' function of the ERC20 contract without checking its return value. If the ERC20 token has implemented any checks in its 'transferFrom' function, then the Airdrop contract could potentially fail. It is always a good practice to check the return value of low-level calls like 'transfer' and 'transferFrom' to ensure that the transaction was successful.",828,189,20.38797950744629
15,access control," Yes, the first smart contract code is vulnerable due to the 'Access Control' issue as stated.

For the second contract, the answer is NO. This contract does not show any obvious vulnerabilities based on the provided code snippet. However, it is important to note that the 'doAirdrop' function is public, and without proper access control, any user can execute it. It would be better to add some access restriction to this function to ensure only authorized users can execute it.",646,102,10.954172849655151
16,access control," No, the second smart contract code is not vulnerable to the access control vulnerability mentioned in the 'access control.sol' issue. The `doAirdrop` function in the `Airdrop` contract checks if the sender of the transaction is the owner of the tokens being transferred, which prevents unauthorized access. However, it is still recommended to follow best practices and use the `transfer` function instead of `transferFrom` in this case, as it would simplify the code and reduce the risk of errors.",736,107,11.505813598632812
17,access control," Yes, the provided Airdrop contract is vulnerable due to the same access control issue as the first contract. The `doAirdrop` function calls the `transferFrom` function of the `ERC20` contract without checking its caller, allowing any user to transfer tokens on behalf of others. This can lead to stolen tokens if an attacker manages to call the function with the address of a contract under their control.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add a restriction in the `doAirdrop` function to ensure that only the contract owner or authorized users can call it. For example:

```solidity
contract Airdrop {
  address owner;

  constructor() public {
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner, ""Only the contract owner can call this function."");
    _;
  }

  function doAirdrop(address _tokenAddr, address[] dests, uint256[] values) public onlyOwner
    returns (uint256) {
    //...
  }
}
```

This way, only the contract owner can call the `doAirdrop` function, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot transfer tokens on behalf of others.",588,283,29.842937707901
18,access control," The answer is YES, the contract Airdrop is vulnerable to access control issues. The `doAirdrop` function calls the `transferFrom` function of the ERC20 contract without checking the msg.sender's permissions to transfer tokens on behalf of the `from` address. This can allow an attacker to transfer tokens they do not own if they are able to call the `doAirdrop` function with a different `from` address.

This is an example of an access control vulnerability where the contract does not properly check the authorization of the caller before performing a critical function. In this case, the critical function is the transfer of tokens. The contract should include a check to ensure that the msg.sender has the necessary permissions to transfer tokens on behalf of the `from` address.",851,170,18.34078097343445
19,access control, The contract Airdrop is vulnerable. The function doAirdrop transfers tokens from msg.sender to dests[i] using transferFrom function of the ERC20 contract without checking if the msg.sender has control over the tokens at the address _tokenAddr. This can lead to a security vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate the contract to transfer tokens that do not belong to them. This is a type of access control vulnerability.,635,95,10.389583349227905
20,access control," Yes, the first contract code is vulnerable due to the 'access control' issue. The vulnerability lies in line 20: `creator = msg.sender;` in the `initWallet()` function. The `initWallet()` function sets the `creator` variable to the message sender, which is the address of the user who calls this function. This could potentially allow any user to become the owner of the contract and execute the `migrateTo()` function, which is meant to be restricted to the contract creator.

The second contract code is also vulnerable due to the same issue. Although the `initWallet()` function is not directly called in the `Airdrop` contract, the `doAirdrop()` function in the `Airdrop` contract calls the `transferFrom()` function of the `ERC20` contract with `msg.sender` as the `from` address. This means that any user can become the `from` address and potentially drain funds from that address.

Therefore, both contract codes need to restrict the `creator` variable and `msg.sender` to the actual contract creator or owner to prevent unauthorized access and potential attacks.",848,254,27.079704523086548
21,access control," Yes, the second smart contract code is also vulnerable. The vulnerability exists in the `doAirdrop` function of the `Airdrop` contract. The function uses `transferFrom` function of the `ERC20` contract without checking the return value. If the token transfer fails, the contract will continue to execute the loop and potentially cause an integer overflow or underflow. This could lead to a security issue or the contract functioning in an unexpected way. The correct approach would be to check the return value of the `transferFrom` function and break the loop if the transfer fails.",581,123,13.280041456222534

24,access control," Answer:

Yes, the first contract code is vulnerable due to the access control issue. The `changeOwner` function is marked as public, which means any address can call this function to change the owner of the contract. This is a security risk as it allows unauthorized addresses to take control of the contract.

The second contract code is also vulnerable due to the same reason. The `changeOwner` function in the `Unprotected` contract is marked as public, which means any address can call this function to change the owner of the contract. This is a security risk as it allows unauthorized addresses to take control of the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `changeOwner` function should be marked as `onlyowner`, so that only the owner of the contract can call this function to change the owner. Here is the corrected code:

pragma solidity ^0.4.15;

contract Unprotected{
address private owner;

modifier onlyowner {
require(msg.sender==owner);
_;
}

function Unprotected()
public
{

The Airdrop contract's `doAirdrop` function calls the `transferFrom` function of the ERC20 contract without checking the return value. If the transfer fails, the Airdrop contract will continue to execute the loop and potentially cause an inconsistent state. Additionally, the `doAirdrop` function does not check if the msg.sender has sufficient balance to transfer the tokens, which can lead to an integer overflow or underflow vulnerability.

Furthermore, the Airdrop contract does not check if the `dests` array and `values` array have the same length, which can lead to out-of-bounds access and cause the contract to behave unpredictably.

27,unchecked low level calls," Yes, the provided code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `Command` function of the `Pie` contract, specifically in the line: `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);`. The issue is that the return value of `call` is not checked, which could lead to fail-opens and other unwanted outcomes if the call to `adr` fails. Additionally, the `data` parameter is passed directly into `call` without checking its contents, which could lead to unintended consequences if `data` contains malicious code.

Furthermore, the `doAirdrop` function of the `Airdrop` contract is also vulnerable because it calls the `transferFrom` function of the `_tokenAddr` contract without checking its return value. If the `transferFrom` call fails, the `doAirdrop` function will continue executing and may not properly handle the failure.

In summary, both contracts contain vulnerabilities related to unchecked low-level calls, which could lead to fail-opens and other unintended consequences.

If this function fails (for example, if there are not sufficient tokens in the `msg.sender` account), it will return false. However, in the current implementation, the contract will continue to execute, assuming the transfer was successful. This can lead to inconsistencies and potential security vulnerabilities.

To fix this issue, the contract should check the return value of the `transferFrom` function and revert the transaction if it fails. This can be done using a require statement, like so:

The block number is predictable and can be manipulated by miners, making it an unreliable source of randomness. This vulnerability exists in lines 38 and 42.

The second smart contract code is not provided in the question, so I cannot evaluate its vulnerabilities.",1074,93,10.448364734649658
95,bad randomness," Yes, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable due to the same issue as the previous one. The `answer` variable in the `GuessTheRandomNumberChallenge` contract is generated using the `block.blockhash(block.number - 1)` and `now` variables, which can be predictable and manipulated by miners. Therefore, the randomness is not truly random and secure, making the contract vulnerable to attacks.

In the `Airdrop` contract, the `doAirdrop` function calls the `transferFrom` function of the `ERC20` contract in a loop. This function could potentially cause the contract to run out of gas if the `dests` array or the `values` array is too large. However, this is not a security vulnerability but rather an issue of gas efficiency. The real vulnerability lies in the `GuessTheRandomNumberChallenge` contract, which is used in the `Airdrop` contract as well.",745,211,22.171285152435303
96,bad randomness," Yes, the smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the following lines:

- uint256 private salt = block.timestamp; (line 11)
- uint256 y = salt * block.number / (salt % 5); (line 17)
- uint256 seed = block.number / 3 + (salt % 300) + y; (line 19)
- uint256 h = uint256(blockhash(seed)); (line 21)

The reason it's vulnerable is that the variable `salt` is supposed to provide randomness, but it's initialized with `block.timestamp`, which is predictable and can be manipulated by miners. Additionally, the calculation of `y`, `seed`, and `h` can be influenced by the predictable `salt` value, making the random number generation insecure.

Furthermore, the code is a combination of the previously reviewed vulnerable contract and an insecure Airdrop contract. The Airdrop contract's `doAirdrop` function uses a `while` loop to transfer tokens without checking the available balance, which can cause the contract to run out of gas or result in an integer overflow.",818,279,29.588277339935303
97,reentrancy," Yes, the provided W\_WALLET contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function, specifically at `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. This line allows for a call to an untrusted contract before the initial execution is complete, potentially changing the contract state in the middle of execution. This is the same line that was identified as vulnerable in the first contract, and the same vulnerability exists in this contract.",1335,101,11.036049842834473
98,reentrancy," Yes, the first smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the line `require(msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)());` in the `withdrawFunds` function. The `call.value` function allows the recipient to execute arbitrary code, potentially calling back into the `withdrawFunds` function before the balance of the sender has been updated and the `lastWithdrawTime` has been updated.

The second smart contract code is also vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The `Airdrop` contract calls the `transferFrom` function of the `ERC20` contract in a loop, allowing the recipient to execute arbitrary code, potentially calling back into the `transferFrom` function before the balance of the sender has been updated. The `withdrawFunds` function in the `EtherStore` contract is also vulnerable for the same reason as in the first contract.",870,204,22.039413690567017
99,reentrancy," Yes, the smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function where it calls the `msg.sender` contract before the state of the contract has been updated. This allows the recipient to call the `Collect` function again before the balance of the sender has been updated, allowing for a reentrancy attack. The specific line of code is:

`if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())`

This allows the recipient to repeatedly call the `Collect` function and drain the contract of funds, similar to the vulnerability in the first code snippet.",1407,133,14.739365100860596
100,reentrancy," Yes, the second smart contract code is also vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The Airdrop contract's `doAirdrop` function calls the `transferFrom` function of the ERC20 contract, which can be an external contract. If the ERC20 contract is malicious or controlled by an attacker, it can call back into the `doAirdrop` function before the first call is completed, allowing the attacker to drain the contract of funds.

The vulnerability lies in the `doAirdrop` function of the Airdrop contract:
```scss
function doAirdrop(address _tokenAddr, address[] dests, uint256[] values) public returns (uint256) {
  uint256 i = 0;

    ERC20(_tokenAddr).transferFrom(msg.sender,dests[i], values[i]); // <-- Here
    i += 1;
  }
  return(i);
}
```
To fix this vulnerability, you can use the ""Checks-Effects-Interactions"" pattern, where you perform checks (e.g., input validation) first, apply effects (e.g., state changes) next, and interact with other contracts last. In this case, you should first update the bal",762,301,31.439889430999756
101,reentrancy," Yes, the second smart contract code is also vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The Airdrop contract's `doAirdrop` function calls an external contract's `transferFrom` function (line 22) without checking its return value, allowing the external contract to call back into the Airdrop contract before the `doAirdrop` function has completed execution. This creates an opportunity for a reentrancy attack.

The SimpleDAO contract's `withdraw` function, which is used in the `transferFrom` function of the ERC20 contract, is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, as explained in the previous answer. This vulnerability can be exploited through the Airdrop contract's `doAirdrop` function.",698,163,17.035067319869995

This is a classic example of a reentrancy vulnerability.",1331,90,10.1943838596344
103,reentrancy," Yes, the smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function where it calls the `msg.sender` directly using `call.value(_am)()`. This allows for the possibility of the msg.sender being an untrusted contract that can call back into the `Collect` function before the state changes of the current execution have been finalized. This can lead to a reentrancy attack where the attacker can repeatedly call the `Collect` function and drain the contract of funds.

In the provided code, the vulnerability is still present, as the `call.value(_am)()` is not replaced with a specific function call to a trusted contract. To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a trusted token contract and call its specific transfer function instead of using the low-level `call.value()` function.",1541,186,19.997353553771973
104,reentrancy," Yes, the second smart contract code is also vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability exists in the `doAirdrop` function of the `Airdrop` contract.

This allows for a reentrancy attack similar to the one in the first contract. The `transferFrom` function can call back into the `doAirdrop` function, allowing an attacker to drain the contract of funds.

The vulnerable line is:
`ERC20(_tokenAddr).transferFrom(msg.sender,dests[i], values[i]);`

The contract should check the return value of the `transferFrom` function and break the loop if the transfer fails. Additionally, the `claimedBonus` mapping used in the `Reentrancy_bonus` contract can be used here as well to prevent reentrancy attacks.",853,211,22.361161708831787

The recipient could recursively call the `Collect` function, draining the contract of its funds. This is the same vulnerability present in the first code snippet.

The `Airdrop` contract does not appear to be directly vulnerable to a reentrancy attack based on the provided code, as it does not modify its state based on external calls. However, it does call the `transferFrom` function of the `ERC20` contract, which could potentially be vulnerable to a reentrancy attack if the recipient token contract is not carefully designed.",1537,197,21.294307470321655

NO

The code you provided in the second part does not contain the same vulnerability as the first part.

The second contract code is not provided in the usual format for evaluation, but I can still analyze it. The `Airdrop` contract has a function `doAirdrop` that calls the `transferFrom` function of the `ERC20` contract. If the `ERC20` contract is not implemented securely, it could potentially allow for a reentrancy attack. However, the vulnerability would not be in the `Airdrop` or `PrivateDeposit` contracts themselves, but rather in the `ERC20` contract.

An attacker can take advantage of this by recursively calling the `CashOut` function, draining the contract of its funds.

The Airdrop contract is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks based on the provided code, as it does not modify the state of the contract or call external contracts in a way that would allow for reentrancy. However, it is important to note that the contract does not check if the sender has sufficient balance to transfer the specified `values` array to the `dests` array.

126,reentrancy," Answer:

Yes, the second smart contract code is also vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The Airdrop contract's doAirdrop function calls the transferFrom function of the ERC20 contract, which can allow an attacker to repeatedly call the doAirdrop function and drain the contract of funds. This is due to the lack of checking for the return value of the transferFrom function, which could indicate a failure or success. Additionally, the userBalances mapping in the Reentrancy\_insecure contract is not being updated before the transferFrom function is called, allowing for further reentrancy attacks.",659,131,14.396077632904053
127,time manipulation," Yes, the provided Airdrop contract is also vulnerable to time manipulation. The `doAirdrop` function calls the `transferFrom` function of the ERC20 contract using the `block.timestamp`. If the ERC20 contract is also checking against the `block.timestamp`, it could be vulnerable to the same time manipulation attack as the TimedCrowdsale contract. The Airdrop contract should use a different source of time or a different mechanism to ensure the security of the contract.",551,108,11.491904973983765
128,time manipulation," Yes, the second smart contract code is also vulnerable to time manipulation. This is because it uses the `now` keyword (which is an alias for `block.timestamp`) in the same way as the first contract, making it susceptible to the same vulnerability. The `draw` function in the `lottopollo` contract calls `randomGen`, which returns `block.timestamp`, and then calls `payOut` with this value. This means that the contract's behavior can be influenced by the miner, just as in the first contract.

Additionally, the `doAirdrop` function in the `Airdrop` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. This is because it calls an external contract's function (`transferFrom` in the `ERC20` contract) without checking its return value. If this function were to allow reentrancy, an attacker could repeatedly call `doAirdrop` and drain the contract of funds.",826,205,22.132287740707397
129,time manipulation," Yes, the provided Governmental contract is vulnerable to time manipulation. The contract uses the block timestamp to determine when the last investment was made and whether a certain amount of time has passed before allowing the resetInvestment function to be called. As explained, miners have control over the block timestamp and can manipulate it to a certain extent. This could allow an attacker to call the resetInvestment function before the required time has passed, leading to potential security issues or exploits.

The provided Airdrop contract does not seem to be directly vulnerable to the same time manipulation issue, as it does not rely on block.timestamp for its core functionality. However, it does use transferFrom function from an ERC20 contract, so if that contract has its own time-dependent vulnerabilities, they could potentially affect the Airdrop contract as well.",1104,179,19.192980527877808
130,time manipulation," Answer:

YES, the contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the Airdrop contract, specifically in the `doAirdrop` function. The function uses a `while` loop to transfer tokens to multiple addresses, but it does not include any checks for potential reentrancy attacks. An attacker could manipulate the block timestamp to repeatedly call the `doAirdrop` function and drain the contract of its tokens. This is similar to the vulnerability described in the given code, where the `Roulette` contract is vulnerable to timestamp manipulation.

Additionally, the `doAirdrop` function uses `transferFrom` function of the ERC20 token, which can also be a source of vulnerabilities if the token contract is not implemented securely. It is always recommended to use the safest possible method of transferring tokens, such as using a `transfer` function with a reentrancy guard.",678,200,21.92102813720703
131,time manipulation," Yes, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to the same issue as the previous one. The vulnerability lies in the line:

`var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;`

This contract is also relying on the block timestamps for generating random numbers, which can be manipulated by miners. Therefore, it's recommended to avoid using block timestamps for generating random numbers or any critical functionality that should not be under the control of miners.",888,107,11.81755542755127
132,short addresses," Yes, the second smart contract code is also vulnerable due to the same issue as the first one. The `sendCoin` function in `MyToken` contract uses `msg.sender` address to check for balance and transfer tokens. If this `MyToken` contract is used with a contract that inherits from `ERC20` (like `Airdrop` contract), an attacker can exploit the `doAirdrop` function to make it seem like the `msg.sender` is the `dests[i]` address, when in reality, it is the address that called the `doAirdrop` function. This can lead to transferring tokens to an unintended address. To fix this, `sendCoin` function should use `tx.origin` instead of `msg.sender` to check for balance and transfer tokens, or implement a different way to ensure the correct `msg.sender` is used.",898,198,21.08771061897278
133,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `emptyCreditors` function of the `DosGas` contract. If the `emptyCreditors` function is called when the `creditorAddresses` array has more than 1500 elements, it will allow an attacker to reset the array and set the `win` variable to `true`. This can be exploited by an attacker to repeatedly call the `emptyCreditors` function, consuming large amounts of gas and potentially causing the contract to become unresponsive or otherwise fail to function properly. This is a denial of service attack because it prevents normal users from being able to use the contract as intended.

The `Airdrop` contract also has a potential security issue. The `doAirdrop` function calls the `transferFrom` function of the `ERC20` contract in a loop, which could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the contract by providing a malicious `ERC20` contract as the `_tokenAddr` parameter. This could allow the attacker to steal funds or otherwise interfere with the normal operation of the contract. It would be a good idea to add additional checks and safeguards to the `doAirdrop` function to prevent this type of attack.",857,284,30.122668027877808
134,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `doAirdrop` function of the `Airdrop` contract. The function calls the `transferFrom` function of the `ERC20` contract in a loop without checking the `dests` array length. If the `dests` array contains a large number of elements, it could cause the contract to run out of gas, resulting in a DoS attack. Additionally, the function does not check if the `dests` array and `values` array are of the same length, which could lead to other potential issues.",988,141,15.255153894424438
135,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract code is vulnerable to denial of service attacks. The vulnerability lies in the same lines as the previous contract:

The lines of code are:
```go
creditorAddresses = new address[](0);
creditorAmounts = new uint[](0);
```
The reason why this is vulnerable is that it resets the contract's state variables `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` to empty arrays. This can be exploited by an attacker to deny service to legitimate users of the contract. By repeatedly calling the `lendGovernmentMoney` function, the attacker can force the contract to reset its state variables, effectively locking out any other users who might want to use the contract.

Therefore, it is not recommended to use these lines of code in a production environment without proper access controls and rate limiting mechanisms in place.",2376,195,21.135735511779785
136,denial of service," Yes, the second smart contract code is also vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack.

The vulnerability exists in the `doAirdrop` function of the `Airdrop` contract. The function uses a `while` loop to transfer tokens to multiple addresses using the `transferFrom` function of the `ERC20` contract. If any one of the `transferFrom` calls fails, the contract will continue to execute the loop and attempt to make further calls, which can result in a denial-of-service attack.

The `doAirdrop` function should use a `for` loop with a condition to break out of the loop in case of a failure, as shown below:

```scss
for (uint256 i = 0; i < dests.length; i++) {
  bool success = ERC20(_tokenAddr).transferFrom(msg.sender, dests[i], values[i]);
  if (!success) {
    break;
  }
}
```

This will ensure that the loop stops executing in case of a failure and prevent a denial-of-service attack.",872,255,26.939870357513428
137,denial of service," Yes, the second smart contract code is also vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability exists in the `doAirdrop` function of the `Airdrop` contract. The function calls the `transferFrom` function of the `ERC20` contract in a loop, without checking the `dests` array length. If the `dests` array is large enough, it could cause the `Airdrop` contract to run out of gas, resulting in a denial of service. The first contract `DosOneFunc` is vulnerable for the same reason, as it also has a function (`ifillArray`) that performs a looping operation without checking the array length, potentially leading to a denial of service.",704,157,17.067885637283325
138,denial of service," Yes, the second smart contract code is also vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack. The vulnerability exists in the `doAirdrop` function of the `Airdrop` contract. The function uses a `while` loop to transfer tokens using the `transferFrom` function of the `ERC20` contract. If any of the calls to `transferFrom` fail (for example, if the sender does not have sufficient tokens), the `require` statement in the `Airdrop` contract will not be executed, and the loop will continue indefinitely, consuming all available gas and causing a denial-of-service attack. To fix this vulnerability, the `Airdrop` contract should use a `for` loop with a fixed upper limit or add a `break` statement to exit the loop if any of the `transferFrom` calls fail.",690,185,19.576650857925415
