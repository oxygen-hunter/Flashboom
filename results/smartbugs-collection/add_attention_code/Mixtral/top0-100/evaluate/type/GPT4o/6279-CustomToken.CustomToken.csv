12,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in the given smart contract stems from the `missing()` function. This function is public and allows **anyone** to set themselves as the owner by calling it. Once a malicious user calls the `missing()` function, they can take control of the contract and execute functions protected by the `onlyowner` modifier, such as the `withdraw()` function. This allows the attacker to drain all the funds from the contract. 

The access control issue here is that there is no proper restriction or initialization of the `owner` variable, making the contract vulnerable to unauthorized ownership changes.",access control,3.0,556.0,6.0,2.550856828689575
13,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the function `DynamicPyramid()`, which assigns the `creator` to `msg.sender`.

The vulnerability lies in the `Map` contract. While the issue is with access control, it specifically relates to the fact that the `set()` function allows any user to modify the `map` array. There is no restriction in place to limit who can call the `set()` function. This allows anyone to alter the state of the `map` array, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or malicious manipulation of the contract's data.

Furthermore, although the `withdraw()` function is protected by a `require` statement ensuring only the owner can withdraw, the lack of access control on the `set()` function is a serious issue that violates the principle of access control.",access control,3.0,569.0,6.0,3.449193239212036
17,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the reckless use of `delegatecall` in the `Proxy` contract.

These functions can be called by any user, allowing them to manipulate the `bonusCodes` array without restrictions. This violates proper access control measures, which is a key security concern. 

Additionally, in `PopBonusCode()`, the `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length)` is always true due to the nature of unsigned integers, making the check redundant. However, the core issue here is the lack of access control.",access control,4.0,584.0,6.0,3.3089070320129395

   - This line performs a low-level call to the `transfer` function of the `token` contract. Since the return value of `call` is not checked, it is vulnerable to potential failures that are not properly handled, which may lead to an incorrect state or loss of funds.

2. **Line 97: `_addr.call.value(_wei);`**
   - Similarly, this low-level call sends Ether to `_addr` without verifying the return value, which can fail silently, potentially leading to incorrect fund management or loss of funds.

This could allow them to reset the investment earlier or later than intended, creating a potential time-based attack.",time manipulation,3.0,528.0,6.0,5.156026363372803
130,time manipulation,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable because of the time manipulation vulnerability in the `Roulette` contract. Specifically:

1. **Line 18 (`require(now != pastBlockTime);`)**: This check ensures that only one transaction can occur per block by comparing the current time (`now`, which is an alias for `block.timestamp`) with `pastBlockTime`. However, since miners can manipulate the block timestamp, they can exploit this condition to either allow or prevent transactions as desired.

2. **Line 20 (`pastBlockTime = now;`)**: Storing the current block timestamp in `pastBlockTime` increases reliance on a value that can be influenced by miners, further making the contract vulnerable to time manipulation.",time manipulation,3.0,580.0,6.0,5.128414869308472
131,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` for randomness generation, which can be manipulated by miners. Specifically, in the `EtherLotto` contract, the line:

```solidity
var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;
```

uses `block.timestamp` to generate a random number. Since miners have control over the block timestamp, they can manipulate it to influence the outcome of the lottery, making it vulnerable to exploitation.",time manipulation,3.0,529.0,6.0,2.7668375968933105
132,short addresses,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability arises from the potential for a **short address attack** in the `sendCoin` function. Specifically, when passing an address as a function argument, it can be improperly padded, which can lead to issues in how the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) processes the transaction. The EVM itself may not detect the problem, but clients interacting with the contract could encode the address incorrectly, resulting in transferred values being manipulated by attackers.

",short addresses,3.0,530.0,6.0,3.122318744659424
133,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability exists in the `emptyCreditors` function due to the potential for a gas exhaustion attack. Specifically, if the `creditorAddresses` array grows significantly large (over 1500 addresses), the process of resetting the array (`creditorAddresses = new address ;`) could require an excessive amount of gas, potentially causing the transaction to fail. This creates a denial of service (DoS) scenario where the function becomes unusable as it cannot complete within the gas limit.",denial of service,3.0,533.0,6.0,2.7298622131347656
134,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability in the contract is a potential **denial of service (DoS)** attack due to the dynamic resizing of the array in the `insertNnumbers` function. Specifically:

- **Line 20: `array.length += 1;`**: Resizing an array dynamically within a loop can be very gas-intensive, especially with a large number of elements. This can lead to a situation where the gas cost becomes too high, causing transactions to fail and effectively making the contract unusable. 

This could be exploited to cause the contract to run out of gas during execution, resulting in a denial of service.",denial of service,3.0,561.0,6.0,3.4153664112091064
135,denial of service,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `Government` contract's `lendGovernmentMoney` function. Specifically, the lines:
```
creditorAddresses = new address ;
creditorAmounts = new uint ;
```
reset the arrays without handling incomplete payouts properly. If the contract balance is too low to pay out creditors, the contract can enter a state where no further operations can proceed, leading to a denial of service. The contract becomes unable to pay creditors, which makes it permanently stuck, fulfilling the criteria of a denial-of-service attack.",denial of service,3.0,546.0,6.0,2.8218934535980225
136,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability is in the `Refunder` contract, specifically in the `refundAll` function. The same denial of service issue exists due to the `require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));` statement. If one of the addresses in the `refundAddresses` array causes the `send` function to fail (for example, due to insufficient gas or because the recipient contract has a fallback function that rejects payments), it will cause the entire transaction to revert, blocking refunds to all subsequent addresses.",denial of service,3.0,542.0,6.0,2.533029317855835
137,denial of service,"YES. It is vulnerable due to the same Denial of Service vulnerability found in the original `DosOneFunc` contract. Specifically, the for-loop in the `ifillArray` function on line 17:

```solidity
for(uint i=0;i<350;i++) {
    listAddresses.push(msg.sender);
}
```

This loop can cause the function to consume a significant amount of gas, potentially leading to a situation where the gas limit is exceeded, preventing the function from executing successfully. This results in a denial of service, as users may be unable to interact with the contract once the gas required to complete the function exceeds the block's gas limit.",denial of service,3.0,568.0,6.0,3.5749473571777344
138,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` line in the `DosAuction` contract. If the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that refuses to accept Ether (or uses more gas than allowed), the `send` function will fail, preventing new bids and causing a denial of service attack. This vulnerability is often referred to as a ""Denial of Service with Failed Send.""",denial of service,3.0,529.0,6.0,2.960176944732666
