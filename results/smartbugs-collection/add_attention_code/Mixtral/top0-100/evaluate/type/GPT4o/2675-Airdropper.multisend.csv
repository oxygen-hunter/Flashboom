11,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function, which allows any external account to assign themselves as an owner by specifying any valid address, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control of the contract.

12,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `missing` function of the `Missing` contract. This function, which sets the owner of the contract, can be called by anyone because it lacks the `onlyowner` modifier, allowing any user to overwrite the `owner` address.

In the provided smart contract, `DynamicPyramid()` is defined as a function, but in Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, it is treated as a constructor because it has the same name as the contract. This can lead to a critical issue when the contract is renamed or refactored, as the function `DynamicPyramid` would no longer be recognized as a constructor but instead as a regular function. 

This allows any user to call it and change the `creator` address, granting them access to the contract's privileged functions that use the `onlyowner` modifier.

17,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of `delegatecall` in the `Proxy` contract. `delegatecall` allows external contracts to be executed in the context of the calling contract, which can lead to access control issues if the called contract is untrusted.

The vulnerability lies in the `PopBonusCode` function of the `Wallet` contract, where the line `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length);` is always true because array lengths are unsigned and cannot be negative. This condition doesn't provide any meaningful access control. Additionally, there's no restriction on who can call this function, allowing anyone to reduce the length of the `bonusCodes` array, which could result in unintended behavior or logic errors.

Moreover, in the `Airdropper` contract, while the `onlyOwner` modifier is used, the visibility of the `owner` variable is public, making it easier for an attacker to identify and target the owner.",access control,4.0,574.0,6.0,2.6840991973876953

The vulnerability arises because the `sendTo` function in the `MyContract` contract still uses `tx.origin` for access control.

The vulnerability in this case is primarily related to the `SimpleSuicide` contract, which allows anyone to trigger the `selfdestruct(msg.sender)` function. This results in the contract's balance being sent to the caller (whoever calls the function). The contract does not have proper access control, allowing any arbitrary caller to destroy the contract and take any funds it holds.

The vulnerability lies in the reckless use of `delegatecall` in the `FibonacciBalance` contract, particularly in lines 31 and 38, where `delegatecall` allows execution of arbitrary code from the `fibonacciLibrary` contract.

This is the same vulnerability as in the original contract you highlighted.

This can result in a fail-open scenario, where the `call()` may fail, but the code will continue executing without reverting.

The vulnerability exists in the `withdraw()` function of the `keepMyEther` contract due to the use of the low-level `call` function, which does not check the return value.

The vulnerability lies in the `IntegerOverflowMappingSym1` contract, specifically in the line:

This opens up the contract to potential time manipulation attacks, where miners could alter the time to either delay or accelerate the contract's execution to their advantage.",time manipulation,3.0,528.0,6.0,2.5533480644226074
130,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability in the smart contract comes from the reliance on the `now` (block timestamp) in the `Roulette` contract. Miners can manipulate the block timestamp to influence the outcome of the `if(now % 15 == 0)` condition, allowing them to control when the contract's balance is transferred, potentially enabling an attack.",time manipulation,3.0,508.0,6.0,3.1557466983795166
131,time manipulation,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` on line 43 to generate randomness: `var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;`. This allows miners to manipulate the block timestamp and influence the outcome, leading to potential exploitation.",time manipulation,3.0,488.0,6.0,2.6830427646636963
132,short addresses,"YES. The contract is vulnerable to a ""short address attack,"" similar to the one described earlier. Specifically, the `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract does not perform length checks on the `dests` and `values` arrays, leaving it susceptible to this attack.",short addresses,3.0,495.0,6.0,2.6474883556365967
133,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is a **Denial of Service (DoS) via Gas Limit** in the `multisend` function. If the `dests` array becomes very large, the `for` loop in `multisend` will consume more gas than allowed by the block gas limit, making it impossible to execute the function and causing the contract to fail. This effectively leads to a denial of service, as legitimate users won't be able to distribute tokens when there are too many recipients.",denial of service,3.0,541.0,6.0,2.494673490524292
134,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability is primarily a **Denial of Service (DoS)** due to the **gas limit** issue in the `insertNnumbers` function. Specifically, the dynamic resizing of the array (`array.length += 1;`) in a loop can lead to an excessive increase in gas consumption as the size of the array grows. This can cause transactions involving this function to fail when the gas limit is exceeded, making the contract vulnerable to a DoS attack. The attacker can exploit this by repeatedly inserting a large number of elements, making the contract unusable.

Additionally, the `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract could also be vulnerable if the number of addresses (`dests`) is large, as the loop iterates over the entire array, potentially consuming too much gas and leading to a DoS situation.",denial of service,4.0,613.0,6.0,3.012518882751465
135,denial of service,NO,denial of service,1.0,436.0,6.0,4.175704717636108
136,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability is present in the `Refunder` contract's `refundAll` function. Specifically, it uses the `send` function, which only forwards 2300 gas. If any recipient address consumes more than 2300 gas or deliberately fails (e.g., using a fallback function to reject payments), it will cause the entire `refundAll` process to fail. This creates a denial-of-service (DoS) attack scenario, as one failed transaction will prevent all other refunds from being processed.",denial of service,3.0,537.0,6.0,3.098804235458374
137,denial of service,"YES, the second contract is vulnerable due to the **Denial of Service** (DoS) attack potential in the `multisend` function.

Explanation:
- The `multisend` function contains a `for` loop that iterates over the `dests` array, calling the `transfer` function for each address. If one of the addresses in the `dests` array is a contract that either consumes a large amount of gas or intentionally reverts the transfer, the entire transaction will fail. This would prevent the rest of the transfers from being executed, effectively resulting in a denial of service for the multisend operation.
