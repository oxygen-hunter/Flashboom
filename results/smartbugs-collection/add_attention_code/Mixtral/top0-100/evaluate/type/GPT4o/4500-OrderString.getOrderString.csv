The vulnerability arises from the public `missing()` function, which allows anyone to set themselves as the owner of the contract.

130,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because it still relies on the `now` (or `block.timestamp`) for critical functionality, specifically in lines:

- `require(now != pastBlockTime);` (line 19)
- `pastBlockTime = now;` (line 21)
  
The vulnerability is due to the potential manipulation of the block timestamp by miners, as explained earlier. This can allow exploitation of the contract's logic for unfair gains, especially with the payout condition `if(now % 15 == 0);` on line 22.",time manipulation,3.0,546.0,6.0,2.1027345657348633
131,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` on line 43 to generate randomness with `uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2`. Since miners can manipulate the block timestamp within a certain range, they can influence the outcome of the random number generation, making the contract susceptible to exploitation.",time manipulation,3.0,500.0,6.0,2.1391468048095703
132,short addresses,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the function `sendCoin(address to, uint amount)` due to the potential for a short address attack. The EVM might accept incorrectly padded addresses, leading to issues when arguments are encoded improperly. This can be exploited if the address length is not correctly verified, potentially leading to incorrect value transfers or unintended behavior.",short addresses,3.0,501.0,6.0,2.717865228652954
133,denial of service,"YES, the contract is vulnerable because the `emptyCreditors()` function still contains the same logic that can cause a denial of service. Specifically:

- The check `if(creditorAddresses.length > 1500)` can lead to an expensive operation in resetting the array with `creditorAddresses = new address ;`.
- When the array grows large, the gas required to clear it increases significantly, potentially exceeding the block gas limit, making the function fail to execute. This is a classic gas limit denial of service attack.",denial of service,3.0,539.0,6.0,2.903721570968628
134,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability still exists in the same lines (18-22) as the previous code. The `for` loop in the `insertNnumbers` function allows the contract to grow the array dynamically by increasing its length, which can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack by exhausting gas during execution. This happens because adding elements in the array, especially in large numbers, requires resizing and copying, which can consume excessive gas and make the function unusable in practice, causing the smart contract to fail.",denial of service,3.0,543.0,6.0,3.0005877017974854
135,denial of service,"YES

It is vulnerable because of the same issue with lines 46 and 48: 
- `creditorAddresses = new address ;`
- `creditorAmounts = new uint ;`

These lines can lead to a denial of service. Specifically, resetting these arrays can cause issues, particularly when multiple creditors exist, as it could prevent proper payouts and disrupt the contract's functionality.",denial of service,3.0,511.0,6.0,3.0805470943450928
136,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the same place as in the previous code: in the `refundAll()` function on line 24. If any address in the `refundAddresses` array fails to receive the refund (for example, due to the recipient rejecting the transfer or running out of gas), the entire `refundAll()` function will revert, preventing refunds to other addresses and causing a denial of service.",denial of service,3.0,521.0,6.0,4.667824983596802
137,denial of service,"YES. The contract is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the `for` loop in the `ifillArray` function, which continues to push addresses into the `listAddresses` array. As the array grows, the gas required to execute the function will increase, potentially exceeding the block gas limit and making the contract unusable.",denial of service,3.0,503.0,6.0,3.8592755794525146
138,denial of service,"YES, the contract is vulnerable because it still contains the line `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` which can lead to a denial of service (DoS) if the current frontrunner's address is a contract that rejects the transfer or runs out of gas, preventing further bids from being placed.",denial of service,3.0,498.0,6.0,2.5448691844940186
