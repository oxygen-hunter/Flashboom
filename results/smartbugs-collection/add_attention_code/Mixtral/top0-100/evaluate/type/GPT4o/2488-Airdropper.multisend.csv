Low-level calls like `call()` do not revert on failure and return a boolean indicating success. In this case, the return value of the call is not being checked. This can lead to a situation where if the external call fails, the transaction still succeeds, which can be exploited to drain funds or lead to unexpected behavior.

The second part of the code (the `Airdropper` contract) does not seem to exhibit this specific vulnerability, as it uses standard ERC20 `transfer()` functions, which will revert on failure. However, the vulnerability exists in the `EBU` contract due to the unchecked return of the low-level call.",unchecked low level calls,3.0,615.0,6.0,2.597231388092041
71,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the vulnerability lies in the unchecked low-level call in the `sendMoney` function, specifically on this line:

```solidity
_target.call.value(_value)();
```

The return value of this low-level call is not checked, which can lead to security issues. If the call fails, the contract does not handle the failure, allowing execution to continue without reverting or taking any action. This is a common vulnerability related to low-level calls, as they do not propagate errors like higher-level Solidity functions do.",unchecked low level calls,3.0,539.0,6.0,4.742024660110474
72,unchecked low level calls,YES. The contract contains a vulnerability similar to the first code provided. The low-level `call` function is used in the `proxy` function without checking the return value of the call. This could lead to unexpected behavior or fail-open scenarios if the call fails but the failure is not handled. This unchecked low-level call could potentially introduce security risks.,unchecked low level calls,3.0,505.0,6.0,2.7079107761383057
73,front running,"YES. The vulnerability in the new contract lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract, which could be subject to a front-running attack.

The solution can be front-run by a malicious user who observes the pending transaction, copies the solution, and submits a higher-fee transaction to preempt the original. The `Airdropper` contract doesn't directly introduce new vulnerabilities but doesn't protect against the front-running issue already present in the `FindThisHash` contract.",front running,3.0,539.0,6.0,4.657350778579712

```

If `numTokens` is a large enough value, the multiplication `numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN` can overflow, bypassing the requirement and allowing incorrect ether amounts to be sent, leading to potential theft or denial of service.

Additionally, in the `sell` function, the line:

```solidity
msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);

also has a similar issue, where if `numTokens` is manipulated to a very high value, it can cause an arithmetic overflow, leading to an incorrect transfer amount or unexpected behavior.",arithmetic,3.0,579.0,6.0,5.3597447872161865
83,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability exists in the `run` function of the `IntegerOverflowMultiTxMultiFuncFeasible` contract. Specifically, on the line:

```solidity

This can lead to an integer underflow. Since `count` is an unsigned integer (`uint256`) and starts with a value of 1, subtracting a larger `input` value (greater than 1) will cause the value of `count` to wrap around to a very large number (because unsigned integers in Solidity wrap around).

86,arithmetic,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerabilities in the `IntegerOverflowSingleTransaction` contract are related to integer overflow and underflow issues in the arithmetic operations. Specifically:

1. **Line 18**: `count += input;` can cause an **overflow** if `input` is large enough to exceed the maximum `uint` value.
2. **Line 24**: `count *= input;` can also cause an **overflow** if `input` is large.
3. **Line 30**: `count -= input;` can result in an **underflow** if `input` is greater than `count`.
4. **Line 36**: `uint res = count + input;` can cause a **local overflow**, although it does not update the state variable.
5. **Line 42**: `uint res = count * input;` can cause a **local overflow**.
6. **Line 48**: `uint res = count - input;` can cause a **local underflow**.

91,bad randomness,"YES, the second smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the **PredictTheBlockHashChallenge** contract's use of `blockhash()` for randomness. The `blockhash()` function, as explained previously, is not a reliable source of randomness since it can be influenced by miners. Specifically, malicious actors can exploit the predictability of block hashes to influence the outcome of the `settle()` function and manipulate the result of the guess.

Thus, this makes the contract vulnerable to attacks that exploit weak randomness generation.",bad randomness,3.0,537.0,6.0,6.208420038223267
92,bad randomness,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in the contract lies in its use of predictable values for generating randomness in the `chooseWinner()` function. Specifically, the values used to generate the random hash are:

1. **`block.coinbase`** (line 99): This value can be influenced by the miner.
2. **`msg.sender`** (line 101): This value can be controlled by the user calling the function.

This is predictable, as both `block.blockhash` and `now` (timestamp) can be influenced or guessed by miners. Hence, the random number is not truly random, making it susceptible to attacks.
