The `MultiOwnable` contract has an access control vulnerability in the `newOwner` function. Specifically, any external caller can add themselves as an owner by calling this function with their own address.

The given code is vulnerable due to multiple access control issues: 

1. **PushBonusCode and PopBonusCode Functions (Wallet Contract)**: There are no access restrictions on `PushBonusCode` and `PopBonusCode` functions. Any external address can call these functions, which allows an unauthorized user to add or remove values from the `bonusCodes` array, effectively manipulating internal data without permission. 

2. **PopBonusCode Method**: The `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length)` check is redundant because array lengths are unsigned and always non-negative. This allows the `bonusCodes.length--` operation to be called by anyone, potentially leading to unexpected results or even underflow vulnerabilities in older Solidity versions.",access control,4.0,581.0,6.0,3.5488390922546387
19,access control,"YES. The vulnerability is in the `Missing` contract. The issue is with the constructor function `Constructor()`. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, constructors should match the contract name exactly. However, the function name `Constructor` does not match the contract name `Missing`, making it a regular function instead of a constructor. This allows any user to call `Constructor()` and take ownership of the contract, leading to an access control vulnerability.",access control,3.0,526.0,6.0,2.705172300338745

The vulnerability exists in the `initWallet` function of the `Wallet` contract. The `initWallet` function is public and can be called by anyone. This allows any user to overwrite the `creator` address with their own address, which leads to access control issues.

It is vulnerable because the `require(tx.origin == owner);` check in the `sendTo` function relies on `tx.origin` for authorization. This can be exploited in a phishing attack, where an attacker tricks the owner into calling the vulnerable contract via another contract.

The vulnerability lies in the `refund()` function of the `Wallet` contract. There is no access control in place, allowing **anyone** to call the `refund()` function and withdraw the entire balance associated with their address, even if that refund was not intended. This lack of access control can lead to abuse by unauthorized users.

Moreover, in the `CustomToken` contract, there is no security around minting the initial supply in the constructor, and the entire supply is assigned to a specific address. This might not be a vulnerability in itself but could present issues if the design intent does not align with this behavior, especially if control over token distribution is required.

- Line 31: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(fibSig, withdrawalCounter));`
- Line 38: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(msg.data));`

`delegatecall` is dangerous because it executes code from another contract (in this case, `fibonacciLibrary`) in the context of the calling contract, meaning that it has full access to the storage and balance of the calling contract.

66,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The vulnerability exists because the contract uses low-level `call()` functions without checking their return values, which can lead to failed executions without being detected. Specifically:

- **Line 44:** `token.call(bytes4(sha3(""transfer(address,uint256)"")),to,amount);` â€” This low-level `call` to transfer tokens does not check whether the call was successful.
- **Line 97:** `_addr.call.value(_wei);` â€” This low-level `call` to transfer Ether also does not check if the transfer succeeded.

Failing to check the return value of these low-level calls can lead to unexpected behavior, where the transfer might fail but the contract logic continues as if it succeeded.

The vulnerability is similar to the one mentioned earlier, an **integer overflow**. The `balance += deposit;` operation in the `add` function of the `Overflow_Add` contract is susceptible to an overflow. Since Solidity 0.4.25 does not automatically check for overflows and underflows, a large enough deposit could cause the `balance` to wrap around and result in unintended behavior.

Moreover, in the `CustomToken` contract, initializing the `totalSupply` with an extremely large value (`10000000000000000000000000000`) might also pose an overflow risk in calculations involving the total supply.",arithmetic,4.0,562.0,6.0,4.0839011669158936

117,reentrancy,"YES, it is vulnerable because the `withdrawBalance` function in the `Reentrancy_cross_function` contract allows reentrancy. Specifically, the line:

```solidity
(bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""");
```

executes a low-level call, which allows the caller's code to be executed before the contract state (`userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;`) is updated. An attacker can exploit this by re-entering the contract via another call (e.g., by calling `transfer()`), allowing them to drain the contract's funds before the balance is updated to zero.",reentrancy,3.0,560.0,6.0,2.8210811614990234
118,reentrancy,"YES

The `Reentrance` contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance()` function, where the contract sends funds to `msg.sender` using the low-level `call` method before updating the user's balance. This allows an attacker to recursively call `withdrawBalance()` to drain the contract's funds before the balance is set to zero.",reentrancy,3.0,512.0,6.0,3.088430404663086
119,reentrancy,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `CashOut` function, specifically in this line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This line is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because it sends Ether using a low-level `call`, and then updates the user's balance afterward. If an attacker creates a malicious contract, they could call the `CashOut` function, and within the fallback function of the malicious contract, they could call `CashOut` again before the balance is updated. This allows them to drain funds repeatedly, exploiting the fact that the balance has not yet been decreased in the first execution.",reentrancy,3.0,562.0,6.0,3.817392110824585
120,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is a reentrancy attack in the `CashOut` function. The `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` on line 38 allows external contracts to repeatedly call back into the `CashOut` function before the state `balances[msg.sender] -= _am;` is updated. This can lead to draining of funds by exploiting the reentrancy vulnerability.",reentrancy,3.0,517.0,6.0,2.891310453414917
121,reentrancy,"YES

The contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because of the low-level `call` function used in the `Collect` function on line 54:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This allows external calls without proper safeguards, and it could permit an attacker to reenter the contract before the contract state (i.e., balances) is updated. This reentrancy can be exploited by malicious actors to repeatedly withdraw funds, draining the contract.",reentrancy,3.0,533.0,6.0,5.891205787658691
122,reentrancy,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability exists due to a potential reentrancy attack in the `CashOut` function, where the contract makes an external call using `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. This allows an attacker to re-enter the contract before the previous execution completes and withdraw multiple times before the balance is updated, leading to potential loss of funds.",reentrancy,3.0,508.0,6.0,2.9803309440612793
123,reentrancy,"YES, the second smart contract is vulnerable due to a potential reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This line uses the low-level `call` function to transfer Ether, which does not forward enough gas for state changes in the caller contract and allows for reentrant calls. An attacker can exploit this by re-entering the contract before the state (`acc.balance-=_am`) is updated, draining the contract's funds.",reentrancy,3.0,545.0,6.0,3.6191062927246094
124,reentrancy,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to a **reentrancy attack**. The vulnerability lies in the `CashOut` function at line 38: 
```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```
Here, the contract sends Ether to the caller before updating the caller's balance. An attacker could exploit this by re-entering the `CashOut` function and draining the contract's funds before the balance is updated.",reentrancy,3.0,524.0,6.0,2.0589303970336914
125,reentrancy,"YES, the contract is vulnerable due to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability exists in the `Collect` function, specifically in the line where it uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` to send Ether to the user. This low-level call allows an external contract to re-enter the `Collect` function before the state update (`balances[msg.sender]-=_am`) occurs, allowing an attacker to repeatedly drain funds from the contract before their balance is reduced.",reentrancy,3.0,527.0,6.0,3.2052998542785645
126,reentrancy,"YES, the contract is vulnerable due to the same reentrancy issue in the `withdrawBalance` function. The caller's code can be executed when the `call.value(amountToWithdraw)` function is invoked before the `userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;` statement is reached. This allows the caller to repeatedly call `withdrawBalance` and drain the contract of funds.",reentrancy,3.0,510.0,6.0,3.711317777633667
127,time manipulation,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` in the `isSaleFinished` function. Since `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners within a certain range, this can lead to time manipulation. This vulnerability allows miners to influence the exact timing of the sale, potentially ending it earlier or later than intended.",time manipulation,3.0,504.0,6.0,3.0224521160125732
128,time manipulation,"YES

The contract remains vulnerable to time manipulation. The issue lies in the use of `block.timestamp` (or `now`) in both the condition in `payOut` and the `randomGen` function. Since miners have control over `block.timestamp`, they can manipulate the timing and potentially influence the outcome of the contract, especially in functions relying on random number generation or time-dependent conditions.",time manipulation,3.0,512.0,6.0,2.6465413570404053
129,time manipulation,"YES, the contract is vulnerable because it relies on `block.timestamp` in multiple places, including line 27 where `lastInvestmentTimestamp` is set. Since miners can manipulate the `block.timestamp` value, it can be used to exploit time-based logic in the contract, leading to potential manipulation of the investment and reset conditions.",time manipulation,3.0,499.0,6.0,4.055732250213623
130,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is in the `Roulette` contract, specifically in the reliance on the `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) for critical logic. The miner can manipulate the block timestamp, which introduces a risk of time manipulation. The code uses `now` in line 18 (`require(now != pastBlockTime)`) and line 20 (`pastBlockTime = now`), and in line 22 (`if(now % 15 == 0)`). The issue arises because miners can adjust the block timestamp within a certain range, potentially allowing them to game the system and win by predicting when the `now % 15 == 0` condition will be true.",time manipulation,3.0,577.0,6.0,2.963928699493408
131,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` to generate a random number in line 43:

```solidity
var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;
```

Miners can manipulate `block.timestamp` within a small range, which could allow them to control the outcome of the random number and thus exploit the contract to win the lottery.",time manipulation,3.0,515.0,6.0,2.5917367935180664
132,short addresses,NO,short addresses,1.0,435.0,6.0,2.7050814628601074
133,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the **DosGas** contract, particularly in the `emptyCreditors` function. The potential denial of service (DoS) attack stems from the requirement to reset the `creditorAddresses` array when its length exceeds 1500. Since clearing large arrays consumes a significant amount of gas, this function could potentially exceed the block gas limit, making it impossible to execute. If the array becomes too large, it may lead to a situation where `creditorAddresses` cannot be reset, effectively locking the contract and preventing further execution of critical functions.

Additionally, the loop in the `addCreditors` function, which adds 350 addresses in each call, could further contribute to the issue by quickly increasing the size of the `creditorAddresses` array, exacerbating the risk of running out of gas during operations.",denial of service,3.0,604.0,6.0,2.6446454524993896
134,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability is due to the possibility of a denial of service (DoS) attack caused by the growing size of the `array`. Specifically, the lines:

- Line 18: `for(uint i=0;i<numbers;i++) {`
- Line 19: `if(numElements == array.length) {`
- Line 20: `array.length += 1;`
- Line 22: `array[numElements++] = value;`

When the `array` grows continuously in the `insertNnumbers` function, this can lead to high gas costs due to dynamically increasing the array size within a loop. Eventually, this could cause transactions to run out of gas, preventing the function from completing and leading to a denial of service.",denial of service,3.0,587.0,6.0,3.4547362327575684
135,denial of service,"YES. The contract is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to the use of `creditorAddresses = new address ` and `creditorAmounts = new uint `. These lines reset the arrays storing creditor addresses and amounts, but if the contract runs out of gas or encounters an issue while performing these operations, it could prevent future creditors from being paid or interacting with the contract properly, leading to a permanent service disruption.",denial of service,3.0,522.0,6.0,5.431075096130371
136,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll()` function, which uses the `send` function. If one of the addresses in the `refundAddresses` array causes the `send` function to fail, it will result in a denial of service (DoS). This happens because the `require` statement will revert the entire transaction, halting the process and preventing further refunds to other addresses. Thus, a single failure to send ether to one address could block all refunds, creating a denial of service situation.",denial of service,3.0,544.0,6.0,2.991044044494629
137,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability in the `DosOneFunc` contract stems from the loop on line 17: `for(uint i=0;i<350;i++)`. This loop performs 350 iterations, pushing the sender's address into the `listAddresses` array each time. If gas limits are reached during execution, this can prevent the function from completing, leading to a denial of service (DoS) where the contract becomes unresponsive for further interactions. The vulnerability lies in the potential for gas exhaustion during execution of the loop, making it susceptible to a DoS attack.",denial of service,3.0,553.0,6.0,3.1977338790893555
138,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` line, which can cause a denial of service if the recipient's address (the `currentFrontrunner`) is a contract that uses up all gas or reverts. If the `send` operation fails, the entire `bid` function will revert, preventing other participants from placing bids, effectively causing a denial of service to the auction.",denial of service,3.0,526.0,6.0,6.714298486709595
