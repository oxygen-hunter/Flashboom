The contract is vulnerable because the constructor function is incorrectly named `missing` instead of `constructor`.

As a result, `win` will never be set to `true`, effectively making the `emptyCreditors` function unusable and causing a denial of service.",denial of service,3.0,558.0,6.0,3.828989028930664
134,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the same location as before: the `insertNnumbers` function. Specifically:

- Line 18: `for(uint i=0;i<numbers;i++)` can cause a denial of service if `numbers` is excessively large, as the loop can consume a lot of gas.
- Line 19: `if(numElements == array.length)` and Line 20: `array.length += 1` dynamically resize the array, which is costly in terms of gas and can lead to an out-of-gas exception if done repeatedly in large numbers. This can make the contract unusable.",denial of service,4.0,563.0,6.0,4.0767412185668945
135,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability still lies in the lines where the arrays `creditorAddresses = new address ;` and `creditorAmounts = new uint ;` are reset to empty arrays. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack because if the contract state is cleared and an external account fails to receive funds (due to a failure in the `send` call), the function will revert, potentially blocking the execution of the contract indefinitely.",denial of service,3.0,529.0,6.0,11.488789081573486
136,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of `send` in line 25. If any of the addresses in `refundAddresses` fails to receive funds (for example, due to a gas issue or a fallback function that reverts), the entire `refundAll` function will revert, blocking refunds to all addresses. This creates a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability because a single failed transaction can stop the whole refund process.",denial of service,3.0,525.0,6.0,3.3734724521636963
137,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is the same as in the previous code. Specifically, the `for` loop in line 18 (`for(uint i=0;i<350;i++)`) repeatedly calls `listAddresses.push(msg.sender);`. This can cause a denial of service due to the high gas consumption when the array grows too large. Once the gas limit is reached, the function will fail, making it vulnerable to a denial of service attack.",denial of service,3.0,526.0,6.0,2.90197491645813
138,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the same line as in the first contract: `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));`. If the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that has a fallback function which uses more gas than available, the send operation will fail, causing a denial of service. This would prevent any other users from placing new bids, as the `bid()` function would revert when trying to send funds to the current frontrunner.",denial of service,3.0,528.0,6.0,4.0140886306762695
