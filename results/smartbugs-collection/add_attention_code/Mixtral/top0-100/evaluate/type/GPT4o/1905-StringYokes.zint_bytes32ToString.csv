73,front running,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `setReward()` and `claimReward()` functions are susceptible to front-running attacks, similar to the previously discussed contract. Specifically, in the `setReward()` function, a malicious actor can observe a legitimate user's transaction and submit their own with a higher gas fee to preempt it. They can exploit the transfer of rewards and gain unauthorized access to funds. Additionally, in the `claimReward()` function, the same type of attack can be applied to steal the reward before the original user can claim it.",front running,3.0,550.0,6.0,2.9638943672180176
74,front running,"YES. It is vulnerable because it still uses the same mechanism for comparing the solution with the stored hash: `require(hash == sha3(solution));`. This allows front-running attacks, where a malicious user can observe the correct solution in a pending transaction and submit their own transaction with higher gas fees, thus preempting the original transaction and stealing the reward.

75,front running,"YES, because the `approve` function and the allowance mechanism are still present in the second contract. The vulnerability associated with front-running can still occur when a user approves a certain amount for a spender, and another transaction could intercept this, allowing a malicious actor to exploit the situation before the original transaction is executed. This creates a front-running risk similar to the one described for the previous contract.",front running,3.0,511.0,6.0,2.5575718879699707
76,front running,"YES

It is vulnerable because the same front-running issue exists in the `play` function. As with the previous contract, the vulnerability is at lines 25 and 28 where players submit their moves.

The vulnerability in the contract lies in the `run` function, where an arithmetic underflow can occur.

The vulnerability still exists in the second smart contract. The line:

128,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability exists due to the reliance on `now` (an alias for `block.timestamp`) in the `payOut` function, as well as the use of `block.timestamp` in the `randomGen` function for random number generation. Both are susceptible to miner manipulation.",time manipulation,3.0,495.0,6.0,3.3558244705200195
129,time manipulation,"YES. It is vulnerable because the `block.timestamp` is used in line 27 to track the last investment time. Miners can manipulate the `block.timestamp`, and this allows them to exploit the contract by influencing the timing of the `resetInvestment` function. This creates a potential vulnerability for time manipulation attacks.",time manipulation,3.0,496.0,6.0,2.8626606464385986
130,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability stems from the use of `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) in both the require condition `require(now != pastBlockTime);` and in the conditional `if(now % 15 == 0);`. Miners have control over the timestamp and can manipulate it to their advantage, potentially exploiting the contract to win the game by influencing the condition `if(now % 15 == 0)` to trigger the payout. This falls under time manipulation vulnerabilities.",time manipulation,3.0,536.0,6.0,2.732891321182251
131,time manipulation,"YES, the contract is vulnerable because it still relies on `block.timestamp` to generate randomness in line 44. This allows miners to manipulate the outcome by controlling the block timestamp, which makes the contract susceptible to time manipulation vulnerabilities.",time manipulation,3.0,479.0,6.0,2.799530029296875
132,short addresses,"YES, it is vulnerable.",short addresses,3.0,439.0,6.0,2.842700958251953
133,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability lies in the same part of the code as in the previous contract. Specifically, in the `emptyCreditors` function, the operation to reset `creditorAddresses` when its length exceeds 1500 (line 22) could potentially run out of gas due to the large size of the array, making the function execution expensive and causing a denial of service.",denial of service,3.0,516.0,6.0,4.283733129501343
134,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the array length is dynamically increased inside a loop. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) by artificially inflating gas consumption, especially as the array grows larger, making it increasingly expensive to execute. If a large number of elements is inserted, the operation could exceed the block gas limit, causing the transaction to fail, resulting in a denial of service.",denial of service,3.0,527.0,6.0,3.045478105545044
135,denial of service,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to lines 46 and 48 where the arrays `creditorAddresses = new address ;` and `creditorAmounts = new uint ;` are reset. If the last creditor is a malicious actor, they can prevent the contract from functioning by denying future creditors from being recorded properly or payouts from being processed correctly. This can effectively freeze the system, making the contract unable to continue its operations.",denial of service,3.0,527.0,6.0,7.208533525466919
136,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function. The use of `send` can fail if the recipient contract's fallback function runs out of gas or deliberately causes a failure. A single failure in `send` will block the rest of the refunds, leading to a denial of service for all remaining recipients.",denial of service,3.0,502.0,6.0,2.7145614624023438
137,denial of service,"YES, the contract is vulnerable due to the same denial of service issue. The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray()` function with the loop:

```solidity
for(uint i=0; i<350; i++) {
    listAddresses.push(msg.sender);
}
```

This loop can result in excessive gas consumption when adding many addresses to the `listAddresses` array, especially as the array grows. This could cause the transaction to run out of gas, preventing the function from executing and causing a denial of service.",denial of service,3.0,540.0,6.0,3.058340549468994
138,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because the vulnerability still lies in the line:

```solidity
require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));
```

This can cause a denial of service if the `send` function fails, either due to insufficient gas or malicious behavior by the `currentFrontrunner`, as it blocks the contract from accepting further bids.",denial of service,3.0,508.0,6.0,2.3434176445007324
