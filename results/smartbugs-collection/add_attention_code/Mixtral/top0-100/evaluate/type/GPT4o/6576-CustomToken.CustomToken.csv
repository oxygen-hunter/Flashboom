Specifically, the line `msg.sender.call.value(balances[msg.sender])();` performs a low-level call without verifying if it was successful. This unchecked call could lead to potential security issues, such as funds not being sent while still updating the `balances` mapping, leading to possible loss of funds or inconsistencies. This makes the smart contract vulnerable to attacks like reentrancy, where an attacker can exploit the contract's state before it gets updated correctly.",unchecked low level calls,4.0,555.0,6.0,4.201557636260986
69,unchecked low level calls,"YES. The vulnerability is present in the `MultiplicatorX4` contract at the `Command` function, which uses a low-level call `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);` without checking the return value.

73,front running,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

It is vulnerable to a front-running attack, similar to the original code. Specifically:

1. In `claimReward(uint256 submission)`, an attacker can observe the original transaction where a valid submission is being made and submit their own transaction with a higher gas fee, preempting the original transaction and claiming the reward first.
   
2. Additionally, the use of `transfer` for sending Ether can be problematic in certain cases, as it could expose the contract to other attacks like reentrancy, though this is not directly related to the ""front-running"" vulnerability.

The vulnerability lies in the `Overflow_Add` contract, which is vulnerable to integer overflow in the `add` function. The version of Solidity used (0.4.25) does not automatically check for arithmetic overflows. If a sufficiently large value is passed as `deposit`, the `balance` can overflow, leading to incorrect results and potential exploitation.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` constructor uses a transfer event but does not explicitly define or invoke the `transfer` function for tokens. However, this is unrelated to the arithmetic vulnerability.

The vulnerability lies in the same issue of integer overflow in the `increaseLockTime` function of the `TimeLock` contract.

The contract is vulnerable due to potential integer overflow/underflow in arithmetic operations. Specifically, in the `buy` function (line 23) and the `sell` function (line 33), the multiplication of `numTokens` by `PRICE_PER_TOKEN` can cause overflows in earlier versions of Solidity (like 0.4.21), as the Solidity compiler did not have built-in overflow checks at that time.

In the `buy` function, if `numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN` overflows, it may pass the `require` check with incorrect values, allowing the purchase of tokens at a lower price. Similarly, in the `sell` function, overflows in `msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN)` can result in incorrect amounts of Ether being transferred, potentially causing a loss or theft of funds.",arithmetic,3.0,603.0,6.0,4.26484751701355

The vulnerability arises from the fact that in the `IntegerOverflowMultiTxOneFuncFeasible` contract, the line `count -= input;` allows for the possibility of an integer underflow. Since `count` is an unsigned integer, subtracting a value larger than the current `count` could cause an underflow, wrapping the value of `count` to a large number. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the contract's state by exploiting this underflow.

To prevent this vulnerability, arithmetic operations involving unsigned integers should include proper checks for underflows and overflows, such as using the SafeMath library, which was introduced later in Solidity versions to protect against these types of vulnerabilities.",arithmetic,3.0,573.0,6.0,2.6077640056610107

Miners can manipulate the block timestamp to influence the outcome, leading to potential exploitation in the payout process. Additionally, in the `payOut()` function, the condition `if (rand > 0 && now - rand > 24 hours)` also relies on `now` (an alias for `block.timestamp`), making it susceptible to timestamp manipulation.",time manipulation,4.0,532.0,6.0,2.265739679336548
129,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` in the `resetInvestment` function, which can be manipulated by miners to influence the contract's behavior, especially regarding timing-based conditions.",time manipulation,3.0,473.0,6.0,2.8269128799438477
130,time manipulation,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to time manipulation. The use of `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) in the `Roulette` contract makes it susceptible to manipulation by miners, as they have control over the block timestamp within a certain range. Specifically, the requirement `require(now != pastBlockTime)` and the condition `if(now % 15 == 0)` rely on the timestamp, allowing miners to influence the result and potentially exploit the contract to win the balance.",time manipulation,3.0,531.0,6.0,3.4314157962799072
131,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` for randomness on line 43:

```solidity
var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;
```

Miners can manipulate the block timestamp to influence the outcome of the random number generation, leading to potential exploitation of the contract. This vulnerability is known as ""timestamp dependence,"" where the miner can adjust the timestamp to increase their chances of winning the lottery or gaining other unfair advantages.",time manipulation,3.0,534.0,6.0,3.404158592224121

The vulnerability lies in the `DosGas` contract. Specifically, the `emptyCreditors()` function tries to reset the `creditorAddresses` array when its length exceeds 1500, which can consume a large amount of gas. This makes the function prone to running out of gas, potentially making it impossible to execute. As a result, the contract could enter a state where no one is able to empty the creditors list, effectively causing a denial of service. This makes the contract vulnerable to a gas limit denial of service attack.",denial of service,3.0,543.0,6.0,3.274346351623535
134,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability in the provided smart contract lies in the `insertNnumbers` function. Specifically, the way the contract handles array resizing and insertion can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the increased gas cost for dynamically increasing the array size within the loop, which can eventually cause the function to run out of gas and fail. This makes the contract vulnerable to DoS by exhausting gas limits.",denial of service,3.0,520.0,6.0,4.334540605545044

136,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability in the `Refunder` contract still exists due to the use of `send()` in the `refundAll()` function. If any address in `refundAddresses` fails to accept the funds (for example, if the receiving contract uses too much gas or deliberately causes the transaction to fail), the entire loop will halt, preventing refunds to all subsequent addresses. This creates a denial of service vulnerability, where a single failing address can block the refund process for all others.",denial of service,3.0,531.0,6.0,4.883058071136475
137,denial of service,"YES

The contract `DosOneFunc` contains the same vulnerability described in your explanation—lines 17 and 18 can cause a denial of service due to excessive gas consumption in the loop. Specifically, the loop pushing 350 addresses into `listAddresses` can lead to out-of-gas issues, which could prevent the function from executing successfully as the array grows.

This vulnerability still exists in the second code snippet since the `ifillArray()` function hasn't been modified and retains the same gas-intensive operations.",denial of service,3.0,536.0,6.0,3.3364551067352295
138,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability in the `DosAuction` contract lies in the line:

```solidity
require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));
```

If the `send` function fails (e.g., due to the recipient being a contract that uses more gas than the `send` function allows or if the recipient is a contract that rejects ether transfers), the whole transaction will be reverted, preventing other users from bidding. This can result in a denial of service (DoS) by making it impossible for anyone else to participate in the auction, effectively locking the auction.",denial of service,3.0,550.0,6.0,3.7054452896118164
