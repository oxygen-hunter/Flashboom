The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function of the `MultiOwnable` contract. Specifically, the function allows any external caller to add a new owner to the contract without any proper access control mechanism verifying if the caller is authorized. This means that any address can call `newOwner` and set themselves or another address as an owner, thus compromising the access control of the contract.

This allows unauthorized users to gain control over the contract and perform privileged actions, like transferring funds from `TestContract` via the `withdrawAll` function.",access control,3.0,544.0,6.0,4.116657018661499

The contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks because the transaction ordering can be exploited. Specifically:

- In the `setReward()` function (line 23), the `owner.transfer(reward)` transfers the reward to the owner before updating the reward value to `msg.value`. This allows an attacker to monitor transactions and send their own transaction with a higher gas fee to set the reward to a new value, exploiting the delay before the original transaction is mined.

- In the `claimReward()` function (line 31), the `msg.sender.transfer(reward)` is vulnerable to front-running as well, where an attacker can see the pending claim and submit a transaction with a higher fee to claim the reward first.",front running,3.0,577.0,6.0,4.367263317108154
74,front running,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the same line:

```solidity

Specifically, the line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())` sends funds before updating the balance, allowing an attacker to exploit this by repeatedly calling the `CashOut` function before the balance is updated, thereby draining funds from the contract.",reentrancy,3.0,505.0,6.0,2.7110166549682617
123,reentrancy,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is due to the reentrancy attack in the `Collect` function. Specifically, in line 29:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This line uses `call.value()` to transfer Ether, which is a low-level function that does not impose any restrictions on the receiver contract. An attacker can exploit this by creating a fallback function in their contract that calls `Collect` recursively before the balance is updated, allowing them to drain the contract's funds. This reentrancy vulnerability can lead to significant losses if exploited.",reentrancy,3.0,555.0,6.0,2.390303134918213
124,reentrancy,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `CashOut` function, specifically in this line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This line allows external calls to untrusted contracts before updating the contract's state (`balances[msg.sender] -= _am`). This creates an opportunity for a reentrancy attack, where an attacker could repeatedly withdraw funds by reentering the `CashOut` function before the balance is updated, draining the contract of funds.",reentrancy,3.0,531.0,6.0,3.885761260986328
125,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of the `call.value()` function in the `Collect` function (line 54). This function allows an external contract to be called and can trigger a reentrancy attack. Specifically, before the contract updates the user's balance (`balances[msg.sender] -= _am`), an attacker can repeatedly call the `Collect` function, draining funds from the contract by exploiting the reentrancy vulnerability. This is the same vulnerability type as described in the original code.",reentrancy,3.0,547.0,6.0,1.663074016571045
126,reentrancy,"YES. It is vulnerable because the `withdrawBalance` function in the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract allows reentrancy. The vulnerability occurs at the line where the call to `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""");` is made. At this point, the external contract (or malicious address) can execute its code, including calling `withdrawBalance` again before the user's balance is set to 0, leading to a reentrancy attack.",reentrancy,3.0,527.0,6.0,3.8564774990081787
127,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `TimedCrowdsale` contract, specifically in the use of `block.timestamp >= 1546300800` to determine whether the sale has finished. This timestamp can be manipulated by miners to some extent, potentially causing unintended behavior, such as ending the sale slightly earlier or later than expected.

The rest of the contract, including `ENS_Permissions` and `Factory`, does not introduce additional vulnerabilities related to time manipulation, but the issue remains in the `TimedCrowdsale` contract.",time manipulation,3.0,545.0,6.0,2.436507225036621
128,time manipulation,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to its reliance on `block.timestamp` for generating random numbers in the function `randomGen()` (line 27), which can be manipulated by miners to influence the outcome of the contract's logic. This opens the possibility for time manipulation attacks. The vulnerability is also present in the `payOut` function (line 13), where the contract compares the current time (`now`) with a random number, which further exposes it to exploitation by manipulating the block timestamp.",time manipulation,3.0,534.0,6.0,2.5917885303497314
129,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the reliance on `block.timestamp` for critical functionality. In this case, miners can manipulate the `block.timestamp` slightly to either extend or reduce the time window for resetting the investment in the `resetInvestment` function. This makes the contract susceptible to time manipulation, allowing a miner to potentially gain an advantage by controlling when the jackpot can be claimed.",time manipulation,3.0,514.0,6.0,3.540123462677002
130,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the same time manipulation vulnerability present in the `Roulette` contract. Specifically, the reliance on `now` (which is an alias for `block.timestamp`) at lines 18 and 20 introduces the possibility of manipulation by miners.",time manipulation,3.0,489.0,6.0,3.600902795791626
131,time manipulation,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` to generate a random number in the line:

```solidity
var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;
```

Miners can manipulate the value of `block.timestamp`, which makes this contract susceptible to time manipulation attacks, leading to predictable randomness. This can be exploited to influence the outcome of the lottery game.",time manipulation,3.0,514.0,6.0,5.177336931228638
132,short addresses,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to the **short address attack** possibility in the `sendCoin` function of the `MyToken` contract. Since Solidity versions prior to 0.5.x do not enforce strict checks on the length of the address and integer parameters, an attacker can craft a transaction with a shorter address, causing the second parameter (`amount`) to be incorrectly decoded and leading to a manipulation of funds. This vulnerability arises from the interaction between the client-side encoding of arguments and the EVM.",short addresses,3.0,537.0,6.0,2.9547038078308105
133,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability in the provided code lies in the `emptyCreditors()` function, specifically with the operation on `creditorAddresses` when its length exceeds 1500. The gas cost to reset the `creditorAddresses` array to zero using `creditorAddresses = new address ;` could become excessively high, potentially causing the transaction to run out of gas, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) attack. Attackers or normal users can trigger this condition, preventing the contract from resetting the array and making the `emptyCreditors()` function effectively unusable.",denial of service,3.0,551.0,6.0,3.1404168605804443
134,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function. Specifically:

1. **Gas Limit Denial of Service**: The loop in the `insertNnumbers` function increases the length of the `array` dynamically and performs multiple iterations based on the `numbers` argument. As the array grows, the function could eventually run out of gas when the array becomes too large. This causes a denial of service because subsequent calls to this function or other functions interacting with the array may fail due to the excessive gas required for execution.

This vulnerability can be exploited by a user to trigger a denial of service for other users interacting with the contract.",denial of service,3.0,564.0,6.0,2.5502970218658447
135,denial of service,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to a **denial of service (DoS)** attack. Specifically, the lines:

- `creditorAddresses = new address ;`
- `creditorAmounts = new uint ;`

are resetting the arrays `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` to zero. This could prevent creditors from being paid out properly, especially if the length of the arrays is manipulated in an unexpected way or if gas limitations prevent certain operations from being processed, causing a DoS.",denial of service,3.0,536.0,6.0,3.816319704055786
136,denial of service,"YES. The `Refunder` contract is vulnerable because of the use of `send` within the `refundAll` function. If any `send` operation fails (e.g., if a recipient is a smart contract with a fallback function that uses more than 2300 gas, or if the recipient rejects the transfer), the entire loop will stop due to the `require` statement, leading to a denial of service. This could prevent other valid refund recipients from receiving their refunds, which makes the contract vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack.",denial of service,3.0,543.0,6.0,3.2622504234313965
137,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability still exists in the `DosOneFunc` contract. The `for` loop in the `ifillArray` function (line 17) pushes up to 350 addresses into the `listAddresses` array each time the function is called. This can result in an out-of-gas error when the array grows too large, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) as the contract will eventually be unable to execute due to high gas consumption. Thus, malicious actors or even regular users can trigger this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the function until it becomes unusable.",denial of service,3.0,552.0,6.0,4.824911594390869
138,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` line. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) because if the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that rejects payments or if the transfer fails due to gas limit restrictions, the function will revert, preventing any new bids from being accepted.",denial of service,3.0,513.0,6.0,2.6092772483825684
