13,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the constructor function `DynamicPyramid()`. In Solidity versions prior to 0.4.22, the constructor was defined using a function with the same name as the contract. However, since the contract is named `Rubixi`, this function will be treated as a normal function rather than a constructor. As a result, anyone can call `DynamicPyramid()` and reassign the `creator` variable, thereby gaining ownership and control over the contract.

The vulnerability exists in the `withdraw` function of the `Wallet` contract. The `require` statement is incorrectly checking that the `amount` is greater than or equal to the sender's balance (`require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);`). It should be checking that the `amount` is less than or equal to the sender's balance. This allows users to withdraw amounts greater than their balance, which creates an access control issue.

Also, in the `CustomToken` contract, there is a direct assignment of all tokens to a specific address, which could be a potential concern depending on the use case.

The `Wallet` contract has access control vulnerabilities because:

1. The `PushBonusCode`, `PopBonusCode`, and `UpdateBonusCodeAt` functions are all public, meaning any external account can call them. This allows anyone to modify the `bonusCodes` array.
2. The `Destroy` function, although protected by a check for the `owner`, could still be a point of vulnerability if the `owner` account is compromised.

In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, constructor functions are defined using the same name as the contract. However, in this code, the constructor is mistakenly named `Constructor()` (with a capital ""C""), which does not match the contract name `Missing`. This causes it to be treated as a regular function instead of a constructor, leaving the `owner` variable unset.

As a result, any address can call the `withdraw()` function and drain the contract funds, bypassing the intended access control check. This makes the contract vulnerable to access control issues.",access control,3.0,569.0,6.0,3.8746001720428467
20,access control,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to the following reasons:

1. **Access Control Issue in `initWallet()`**: The function `initWallet()` sets the `creator` to the address of the caller (msg.sender) without any access restrictions. This means that any external user can call this function and set themselves as the creator, gaining unauthorized control over the contract.

2. **Unprotected Migrate Function**: The function `migrateTo(address to)` allows the creator to transfer the entire contract balance to another address. Since `initWallet()` can be called by anyone, they could set themselves as the creator and subsequently call `migrateTo()` to drain the contract's funds.

The vulnerability in the `SimpleSuicide` contract is caused by the `selfdestruct(msg.sender);` line, which allows any address to trigger the self-destruction of the contract. The `selfdestruct` function can be called by any user, and since it sends all the remaining funds of the contract to the caller's address, this is an access control vulnerability.

In the given code, the `sudicideAnyone()` function is public, and there are no restrictions on who can call it. As a result, any user can call this function and destroy the contract, potentially draining any funds or state information stored in the contract.

The vulnerability lies in the reckless use of `delegatecall` in the `FibonacciBalance` contract. Specifically, lines 31 and 38 pose risks by allowing the `fibonacciLibrary` to execute code in the context of the `FibonacciBalance` contract. Since the contract does not implement any access control mechanisms to restrict who can trigger these calls, an attacker could exploit this to gain control of the contract’s state or transfer funds.

The vulnerability still exists in the provided code. Specifically:

1. **Line 54**: `owner2.send(sum2);` uses a low-level `.send()` function, which only returns a boolean to indicate success or failure. If `send` fails, the failure is not propagated, and the contract continues execution, potentially leaving the contract in an undesirable state.
   
2. **Line 65**: `owner.send(balance);` also uses a low-level `.send()` function without checking its return value, leading to similar risks of unnoticed failure.

If the `creditorAddresses` array grows too large, resetting it by creating a new empty array could require more gas than is available, making it impossible to execute the `emptyCreditors()` function. This can lead to a denial of service scenario, as the condition to empty the array might never be met due to the high gas requirements.",denial of service,3.0,573.0,6.0,3.0784990787506104
134,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function due to the dynamic array resizing logic. Specifically, the repeated increase of `array.length` within the loop can lead to excessive gas consumption, resulting in a denial of service. This could happen when a large number of elements are inserted, as dynamically increasing the array size and updating it in every iteration becomes increasingly expensive and could exceed the block gas limit, making the contract unusable.

Additionally, this vulnerability falls under the category of denial of service due to gas limit exhaustion.",denial of service,3.0,541.0,6.0,2.477205514907837
135,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability exists in the `Government` contract due to a potential denial of service (DoS) attack. Specifically, the issue lies in lines:

- `creditorAddresses = new address ;`
- `creditorAmounts = new uint ;`

This can lead to a situation where, if a large number of creditors exist or if their execution fails due to insufficient gas, resetting the arrays could cause a DoS, preventing further interactions with the contract. Additionally, the `send` function used for transferring funds can fail if recipients reject funds or if the gas limit is insufficient, which can block critical contract functions from completing.",denial of service,3.0,561.0,6.0,2.4231436252593994
136,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function of the `Refunder` contract. Specifically, if any of the addresses in `refundAddresses` fails to receive the funds (i.e., the `.send` call fails), it will trigger the `require` statement to revert the entire transaction. This behavior can result in a denial of service, as one failing address will prevent the remaining addresses from receiving their refunds.",denial of service,3.0,520.0,6.0,2.647996187210083

138,denial of service,"YES, the vulnerability still exists in the **DosAuction** contract.

The vulnerability is due to the line:
```solidity
require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));
```

In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, the `send` function only forwards 2300 gas, which may not be enough to execute certain operations in the recipient's fallback function. If the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract with a fallback function that uses more than 2300 gas or deliberately fails, the `send` function will return `false`, causing the `require` statement to fail and thus prevent anyone from bidding. This results in a **Denial of Service (DoS)** vulnerability.",denial of service,3.0,580.0,6.0,2.470735788345337
