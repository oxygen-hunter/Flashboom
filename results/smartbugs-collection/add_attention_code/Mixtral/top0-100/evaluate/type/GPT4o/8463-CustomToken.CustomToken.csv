The vulnerability in the first smart contract lies in the constructor function, which is named `DynamicPyramid()` instead of matching the contract name, `Rubixi`. In Solidity version 0.4.15, if the constructor function does not match the contract name, it becomes a regular public function. This allows anyone to call the `DynamicPyramid()` function and reassign the `creator` variable, taking ownership of the contract. This leads to an access control vulnerability.

The second contract does not appear to exhibit the same issue.",access control,3.0,542.0,6.0,2.074004888534546
14,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because in the `withdraw` function, the requirement `require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);` should actually be `require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);`.

16,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in the `Map` contract lies in its **access control**. Specifically, the `set` function allows *any user* to modify the contents of the `map` array. This should be restricted, as it can enable unauthorized users to change critical data.

Additionally, in the `CustomToken` contract, the constructor function is defined incorrectly using `function CustomToken() public` instead of the correct `constructor() public`.

This type of vulnerability is classified as ""bad randomness.""

This is vulnerable because:
1. **Predictability of `block.blockhash`**: The `block.blockhash` of a recent block (like `block.number - 1`) can be known or manipulated by miners, making it predictable.
2. **Predictability of `now` (timestamp)**: The `now` (or `block.timestamp`) can be influenced by miners within a small range, adding to the vulnerability.
