The vulnerability exists in both `owner.transfer(reward)` on line 23 and `msg.sender.transfer(reward)` on line 31, which allow a front-runner to preempt the reward claim.",front running,3.0,542.0,6.0,2.9234535694122314
74,front running,"YES, the second smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is due to the same issue as the previous contract. The function `solve(string solution)` uses `require(hash == sha3(solution));` to check if the solution matches a stored hash. Since the Ethereum blockchain is public, a malicious user can observe the original user's transaction containing the solution and then front-run it by submitting a transaction with higher gas fees, allowing them to steal the reward of 1000 ether.

An attacker can exploit this by draining the contract's funds through recursive calls.",reentrancy,3.0,518.0,6.0,2.836451530456543
124,reentrancy,"YES

The contract is vulnerable due to the use of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `CashOut` function. This line allows reentrancy because it sends Ether to an external address without updating the internal balances first. An attacker can repeatedly call the `CashOut` function before the contract updates the user's balance, allowing them to withdraw more funds than they should be able to.",reentrancy,3.0,515.0,6.0,2.6883153915405273
125,reentrancy,"YES

It is vulnerable because the `Collect` function uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` to transfer funds. This allows for a reentrancy attack, where the external contract could repeatedly call the `Collect` function before the state is updated, potentially draining the contract.",reentrancy,3.0,491.0,6.0,3.411886215209961
126,reentrancy,"YES, the contract is vulnerable because the same reentrancy issue exists in the `withdrawBalance` function, where the contract allows external calls via `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""")` before updating the balance. This could allow an attacker to call `withdrawBalance` again before `userBalances[msg.sender]` is set to 0.",reentrancy,3.0,505.0,6.0,2.9017794132232666
127,time manipulation,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` in the `isSaleFinished` function. As miners can manipulate the block's timestamp, relying on this value can lead to time manipulation attacks, where the actual timing of events like the end of a sale can be manipulated by the miner for their advantage. This makes the contract susceptible to exploitation.",time manipulation,3.0,505.0,6.0,2.727769613265991
128,time manipulation,"YES, the contract is vulnerable because it still relies on `block.timestamp` (line 27) for randomness generation and uses it in time-based conditions (line 13: `if ( rand> 0 && now - rand > 24 hours )`). Both of these usages can be manipulated by miners, leading to potential vulnerabilities.",time manipulation,3.0,500.0,6.0,2.8107450008392334
129,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability in the code is due to the use of `block.timestamp` for time-based logic. Miners can manipulate `block.timestamp`, and since the `resetInvestment()` function depends on this value, it can be exploited. Specifically, the condition `if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp + ONE_MINUTE)` can be bypassed by manipulating the timestamp, allowing an attacker to call `resetInvestment()` earlier or later than intended.",time manipulation,3.0,523.0,6.0,2.328155755996704
130,time manipulation,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the usage of `now` (an alias for `block.timestamp`) in the fallback function. Since `block.timestamp` can be influenced by miners within a certain range, the contract's reliance on `now` for critical logic, such as `require(now != pastBlockTime);` and determining payouts based on `now % 15 == 0`, makes it susceptible to manipulation. This allows a malicious miner to potentially control the outcome of the game, creating a security risk.",time manipulation,3.0,535.0,6.0,3.3515965938568115
131,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable because the contract still relies on `block.timestamp` to generate the random number at line 43, which can be manipulated by miners to influence the outcome of the game. This creates a security vulnerability related to time manipulation.",time manipulation,3.0,482.0,6.0,3.1016685962677
132,short addresses,"YES. It is vulnerable due to the possibility of a short address attack in the `sendCoin` function, which takes an `address` and a `uint` as parameters. Since Solidity versions before 0.5.0 do not check for correctly padded input, this can lead to incorrect encoding of arguments if the address parameter is shorter than expected, allowing the vulnerability to be exploited.",short addresses,3.0,511.0,6.0,7.416177034378052
133,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `emptyCreditors` function, specifically with the operation of resetting the `creditorAddresses` array when its length exceeds 1500. If the array becomes too large, this operation can consume an excessive amount of gas, leading to a denial of service as it may prevent the function from being executed due to gas limits. This is an example of a gas limit vulnerability, which can be exploited to cause a denial of service in the contract.",denial of service,3.0,536.0,6.0,2.9990999698638916
134,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability still lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, where dynamically increasing the array size within the loop (lines 19-22) can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) by consuming an excessive amount of gas. When the array length becomes too large, this operation will require an increasing amount of gas, potentially exceeding the block gas limit and making it impossible to execute the function, thus rendering the contract unusable.",denial of service,3.0,529.0,6.0,2.6502904891967773
135,denial of service,"YES

The contract is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the fact that if a malicious creditor's address refuses to receive funds (e.g., by reverting when receiving Ether), the `lendGovernmentMoney()` function's attempt to send payments to creditors will fail. This can prevent the entire process of paying out creditors from completing, effectively causing a denial of service and preventing other creditors from being paid. 

Additionally, the use of `send()` (which sends only 2300 gas and fails if the recipient runs out of gas) exacerbates this risk.",denial of service,3.0,556.0,6.0,6.855894327163696
136,denial of service,"YES. 

The contract is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to the use of `send()` in the `refundAll()` function. If any one of the `send()` operations fails (for example, if one recipient address rejects the transfer due to insufficient gas), the entire loop will revert, preventing further refunds and causing a denial of service for all recipients. This vulnerability is similar to the issue in the previous contract.",denial of service,3.0,524.0,6.0,2.393808126449585
137,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is similar to the previous one. The function `ifillArray` contains a `for` loop (line 16: `for(uint i=0;i<350;i++)`) that repeatedly pushes addresses into the `listAddresses` array (line 17: `listAddresses.push(msg.sender);`). As the size of the array grows, this operation becomes increasingly expensive in terms of gas. Eventually, the gas cost could exceed the block gas limit, making the function fail and causing a denial of service for anyone trying to interact with the contract. This makes the contract vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack.",denial of service,3.0,566.0,6.0,2.340862989425659
138,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability remains in the same line as the previous contract: `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));`. If the current frontrunner's address is a contract that does not properly accept Ether or has a fallback function that consumes all the gas, the `send()` function will fail, causing the entire transaction to revert. This can be exploited to block any further bids, effectively creating a denial-of-service condition.",denial of service,3.0,525.0,6.0,2.7635698318481445
