The vulnerability in the contract arises in the `newOwner` function within the `MultiOwnable` contract. This function allows any external address to add a new owner by setting the `owners` mapping. Since the function does not enforce any ownership or permission checks, it allows any user to potentially add themselves as an owner, thus bypassing access control.

127,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because it relies on `block.timestamp` in the `isSaleFinished` function, which can be manipulated by miners. This creates the potential for time-based attacks, as the timestamp is not entirely reliable and can be skewed within a small range, impacting the contract's logic for determining when the sale is finished.",time manipulation,3.0,503.0,6.0,2.2288520336151123
128,time manipulation,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` (or `now`) to generate randomness and control payout conditions. This makes the contract susceptible to manipulation by miners, as they can slightly alter the block's timestamp to influence the contract's behavior, particularly in the lines where `block.timestamp` is used to generate the random number (`randomGen` function) and in the payout conditions (`payOut` function). Thus, it is vulnerable to time manipulation exploits.",time manipulation,3.0,528.0,6.0,3.2020838260650635
129,time manipulation,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` in the `Governmental` contract, specifically in the `resetInvestment` and `invest` functions. Since `block.timestamp` is set by miners, it can be manipulated within a certain range. This creates an opportunity for a malicious miner to exploit the timing of the `resetInvestment` function, especially when it depends on the condition `block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp + ONE_MINUTE`. By manipulating the timestamp, an attacker could force a reset at a more favorable time for themselves.",time manipulation,3.0,544.0,6.0,4.223910808563232
130,time manipulation,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of `now` (an alias for `block.timestamp`) in the `Roulette` contract, which can be manipulated by miners, as discussed in the explanation. Specifically, the following lines introduce the issue:

- **Line 18:** `require(now != pastBlockTime);` – This check can be bypassed by a miner who manipulates the timestamp within their allowable range.
- **Line 20:** `pastBlockTime = now;` – Storing the timestamp also depends on a potentially manipulated value, further propagating the vulnerability.

Thus, the reliance on `now` makes the contract susceptible to time manipulation attacks.",time manipulation,3.0,573.0,6.0,2.643479585647583
131,time manipulation,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in using `block.timestamp` for generating randomness in the `EtherLotto` contract. As miners can manipulate the block timestamp, the randomness generated by `uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2` can be influenced, allowing for potential exploitation and manipulation of game outcomes.",time manipulation,3.0,499.0,6.0,4.148655891418457

133,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `DosGas` contract, specifically in the `emptyCreditors` function. The condition `if(creditorAddresses.length>1500)` and the subsequent clearing of the `creditorAddresses` array (`creditorAddresses = new address `) can lead to a denial of service (DoS) due to the gas cost. If the array grows large, removing all addresses at once could exceed the block gas limit, preventing the function from executing successfully, thereby causing a denial of service.

",denial of service,3.0,540.0,6.0,2.9821343421936035
134,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability in the `DosNumber` contract stems from the potential for denial of service (DoS) due to the inefficient way the array is resized dynamically during the `insertNnumbers` function. Specifically:

- **Lines 18-22**: Each time an insertion happens and `numElements` reaches the array's current length, the array length is increased by one. This process of resizing the array incrementally creates a performance bottleneck, which could lead to high gas consumption and potentially cause a transaction to fail if the gas limit is exceeded. This is a common cause of DoS by increasing the gas required to execute the function.

",denial of service,3.0,565.0,6.0,10.572689056396484
135,denial of service,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

The vulnerability arises from the use of `send()` in multiple places, such as:

- Line 35: `msg.sender.send(amount);`
- Line 39: `creditorAddresses[creditorAddresses.length - 1].send(profitFromCrash);`
- Line 61: `buddy.send(amount * 5/100);`

The `send()` function only forwards 2300 gas, which is often insufficient for complex operations. If one of the addresses (e.g., a creditor or buddy) is a contract with a fallback function that requires more gas, the `send()` operation will fail, preventing subsequent payments and blocking further contract execution. This creates a denial-of-service condition for the entire contract.",denial of service,3.0,597.0,6.0,4.15375828742981
136,denial of service,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability exists in the `refundAll()` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));
```

This line can lead to a **Denial of Service (DoS)** vulnerability. If any address in `refundAddresses` rejects the payment (for example, if the fallback function runs out of gas or reverts), the entire loop will stop, and no further refunds will be processed. As a result, all subsequent addresses will be unable to receive their refunds. This is a classic case of DoS in smart contracts.",denial of service,3.0,563.0,6.0,5.748548269271851

138,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the line:

```solidity
require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));
```

This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack because if the `send()` function fails, the `bid()` function will revert, preventing new bids from being placed. This happens if the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that refuses to accept payments (e.g., due to fallback functions with high gas requirements or intentionally causing the transfer to fail).",denial of service,3.0,540.0,6.0,2.976520538330078
