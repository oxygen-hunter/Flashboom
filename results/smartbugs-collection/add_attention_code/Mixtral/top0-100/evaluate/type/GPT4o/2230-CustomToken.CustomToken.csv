Specifically, the use of `msg.sender.call.value(userBalance[msg.sender])()` allows an external contract to re-enter the function and call `withdrawBalance` again before the previous execution is completed. This can drain the contract of its funds if not properly mitigated.",reentrancy,3.0,520.0,6.0,2.3435757160186768
119,reentrancy,"YES

The vulnerability exists due to the reentrancy issue in the `CashOut` function. Specifically, the line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This low-level `call` function allows an external contract (controlled by the attacker) to recursively call the `CashOut` function before the `balances[msg.sender] -= _am;` line is executed. This enables the attacker to withdraw funds multiple times before the balance is properly updated, which is a classic reentrancy vulnerability.",reentrancy,3.0,541.0,6.0,3.4055850505828857
120,reentrancy,"YES

The contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `CashOut` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This is a low-level call that sends ether to `msg.sender` without updating the balances first. Since the balance is only updated after the call, an attacker could exploit this by repeatedly calling the `CashOut` function before the balance is updated, draining the contract of funds.",reentrancy,3.0,534.0,6.0,2.4044854640960693
121,reentrancy,"YES

The vulnerability exists in the `Collect` function, specifically at this line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This code allows for a reentrancy attack. When the `call.value()` function is used to send Ether to an external address, it gives control to the recipient's contract, which could call the `Collect` function again before the first invocation completes. This allows the attacker to withdraw more funds than they should be able to, as the state (`balances[msg.sender]`) is only updated after the external call, making the contract vulnerable to reentrancy.",reentrancy,3.0,558.0,6.0,3.891035318374634
122,reentrancy,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.

Explanation: The vulnerability lies in the `CashOut` function, specifically at this line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This uses a low-level `call` function to transfer Ether without protecting the contract state before making the external call. If the recipient is a malicious contract, it can recursively call `CashOut` before the contract updates the `balances[msg.sender]` value, allowing the attacker to drain the contract's funds.",reentrancy,3.0,543.0,6.0,2.9064652919769287
123,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because it contains a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function, specifically in the following line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This line uses the low-level `call` function to send Ether to the calling address (`msg.sender`). However, it does so before updating the user's balance:

```solidity
acc.balance -= _am;
```

As a result, a malicious contract could exploit this by recursively calling the `Collect` function, allowing it to withdraw funds multiple times before the balance is updated, leading to a reentrancy attack.",reentrancy,3.0,561.0,6.0,4.693851947784424
124,reentrancy,"YES

It is vulnerable due to the reentrancy attack in the `CashOut` function. Specifically, the line:
```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```
allows an external contract to call back into the `CashOut` function before the contract state is updated (i.e., before the balance is reduced). This could allow an attacker to withdraw more funds than they are entitled to by re-entering the function multiple times, draining the contract.",reentrancy,3.0,531.0,6.0,3.1058528423309326
125,reentrancy,"YES

It is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because in the `Collect` function, the contract allows external calls using `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` before the contract's state (i.e., `balances[msg.sender]`) is updated. This can allow an attacker to repeatedly call the `Collect` function and drain the contract's funds before the state is updated, leading to a reentrancy exploit.",reentrancy,3.0,519.0,6.0,2.2547030448913574
126,reentrancy,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. The `withdrawBalance` function in the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract allows for a reentrancy attack. Specifically, the call to `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""")` can be exploited by an attacker to repeatedly call the `withdrawBalance` function before the initial execution completes, allowing the attacker to drain the contract's funds.",reentrancy,3.0,512.0,6.0,6.720558404922485
127,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the same line where `block.timestamp` is used in the `TimedCrowdsale` contract to determine whether the sale has finished. As explained before, the block timestamp can be manipulated by miners within a certain range, leading to potential exploitation.",time manipulation,3.0,488.0,6.0,3.6926326751708984
128,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of `now` and `block.timestamp` for time-dependent logic and random number generation. Specifically:

1. **Line 13**: `if (rand > 0 && now - rand > 24 hours)` can be manipulated because miners have some control over the block timestamp, which introduces the risk of **timestamp manipulation**. This allows them to alter the conditions under which payouts are triggered.

2. **Line 27**: `return block.timestamp;` is used in the `randomGen()` function to generate a random number. Since `block.timestamp` is not a secure source of randomness, it can be influenced by miners, resulting in **bad randomness**.",time manipulation,4.0,583.0,6.0,3.1850554943084717
129,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of `block.timestamp` for time-based logic in the function `resetInvestment()` (line 21). The reliance on `block.timestamp` allows miners to manipulate the timestamp and potentially exploit the contract, especially in cases where the exact timing of events matters, as miners have the ability to adjust timestamps slightly to benefit themselves.

Additionally, the loop in the `attack()` function in the `Attacker` contract can cause a gas exhaustion issue by recursively calling itself up to 1023 times, increasing the risk of running out of gas.",time manipulation,4.0,555.0,6.0,3.391493797302246
130,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because it still relies on `now` (or `block.timestamp`) for determining certain actions, specifically in the lines:

- `require(now != pastBlockTime); // only 1 transaction per block`
- `pastBlockTime = now;`
- `if(now % 15 == 0) { // payout if block.timestamp divisible by 15}`

This allows miners to manipulate the timestamp, which can lead to unfair outcomes, such as winning the contract's balance by adjusting the block time to meet the required conditions (like `now % 15 == 0`). This vulnerability is categorized under time manipulation.",time manipulation,3.0,564.0,6.0,4.239353656768799
131,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `EtherLotto` contract, specifically in the line:

```solidity
var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;
```

This code uses `block.timestamp` for generating randomness, making it vulnerable to time manipulation. Miners can manipulate the timestamp, thereby affecting the outcome of the randomness, which can be exploited by malicious actors to predict or control the result of the game.",time manipulation,3.0,522.0,6.0,2.097149133682251

133,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `emptyCreditors` function. If the `creditorAddresses` array grows beyond 1500 entries, clearing the array with `creditorAddresses = new address ;` can consume an excessive amount of gas, leading to a denial of service (DoS) attack. This can make the function impossible to execute if the gas cost exceeds the block gas limit. Hence, this creates a potential for DoS by making the contract non-functional under high gas consumption scenarios.",denial of service,3.0,535.0,6.0,2.983696460723877
134,denial of service,"YES

It is vulnerable because of the potential for a **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack in the `insertNnumbers` function. Specifically, the loop dynamically increases the length of the `array` within the function, leading to a significant amount of gas being consumed, especially if `numbers` is large. This can result in the function running out of gas, causing a failure and making the contract unusable. Additionally, the `clearDOS` function, which resets the array, can also become expensive and prone to failure if the array size becomes very large.",denial of service,3.0,550.0,6.0,2.359541177749634
135,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability arises from the potential denial of service due to clearing the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays (lines 46 and 48) without proper handling of existing creditors. This can disrupt the payout mechanism, leading to a state where the contract may not function as intended, causing a denial of service for future transactions and payouts.",denial of service,3.0,507.0,6.0,3.3895785808563232
136,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because of the same issue found in the `refundAll()` function. The line `require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));` can cause a denial of service if any of the `send` operations fail. This would stop the execution of the entire loop, preventing refunds to other addresses.",denial of service,3.0,506.0,6.0,3.2804348468780518
137,denial of service,"**YES**, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in this contract lies in the `DosOneFunc` function, specifically in the `for` loop inside the `ifillArray` function. This loop (`for(uint i=0;i<350;i++)`) can potentially cause a **denial of service (DoS)** attack due to gas exhaustion. If the gas limit is reached during the execution of this function (due to the addition of addresses to the `listAddresses` array), the transaction will fail, and the function will become unusable. This could prevent users from interacting with the contract effectively, especially as the list grows larger, leading to a potential denial of service.",denial of service,3.0,573.0,6.0,2.5977213382720947
138,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the same line as in the first contract: `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));`. This can potentially cause a **Denial of Service** (DoS) if the current frontrunner is a contract that has a fallback function which either reverts or consumes more gas than the block gas limit allows. In such cases, the `send` call would fail, preventing anyone else from successfully placing a higher bid and causing the auction to be effectively frozen.",denial of service,3.0,535.0,6.0,3.3823113441467285
