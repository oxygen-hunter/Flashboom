19,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the function `Constructor()`. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, constructors are defined with the same name as the contract. However, in this contract, the function `Constructor()` is not treated as a constructor because the function name should match the contract name exactly in older Solidity versions.

26,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability stems from the use of `delegatecall` in lines 31 and 38, which can be exploited in an access control context. Specifically:

1. **Line 31**: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(fibSig, withdrawalCounter));` allows an external contract (`fibonacciLibrary`) to execute code in the context of the `FibonacciBalance` contract. This makes it susceptible to malicious manipulation if an attacker can modify or replace the `fibonacciLibrary` address, allowing arbitrary code execution.
  
2. **Line 38**: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(msg.data));` again uses `delegatecall` with `msg.data`, which is risky since an attacker could potentially craft data to execute arbitrary functions within the context of the calling contract.

Since miners have some control over the block timestamp, they can manipulate it, leading to potential exploitation, especially in scenarios where time manipulation can affect the contract's behavior, such as determining payouts or winners in a lottery.",time manipulation,3.0,529.0,6.0,3.5492653846740723
129,time manipulation,"YES. The contract is vulnerable because it relies on `block.timestamp` (line 27) to track when the last investment was made. This value can be manipulated by miners, which introduces the risk of time manipulation attacks, where miners can influence the outcome of time-based logic in the contract.",time manipulation,3.0,492.0,6.0,2.4907150268554688
130,time manipulation,"YES. The contract is vulnerable due to its reliance on `now` (which is an alias for `block.timestamp`) for critical functionality. Miners can manipulate the timestamp to exploit the condition in the fallback function, specifically:

1. **Line 18:** `require(now != pastBlockTime);` - This line can be manipulated because miners control `block.timestamp`, which allows them to influence when a transaction can pass this check.
2. **Line 20:** `pastBlockTime = now;` - This assigns the manipulated `now` value to `pastBlockTime`, allowing further manipulation in future blocks.
3. **Line 22:** `if(now % 15 == 0)` - Miners can adjust the timestamp to make the condition true, thus draining the contract's balance when the modulo operation returns 0.",time manipulation,3.0,601.0,6.0,3.2539021968841553
131,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` for generating randomness in the `play` function. This allows potential time manipulation by miners. The line:

```solidity
var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;
```

uses `block.timestamp` to create a random value, which is predictable and can be manipulated by miners. They can influence the block's timestamp and thus increase their chances of winning, exploiting the contract's reliance on weak randomness.",time manipulation,3.0,538.0,6.0,7.185248374938965
132,short addresses,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to a potential **short address attack** in the `sendCoin` function, which is the same vulnerability present in the first contract. The issue lies in the way the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) handles address padding and how some clients may incorrectly encode addresses. Specifically, the `sendCoin` function does not validate or account for incorrectly padded address arguments, making it susceptible to this type of attack.",short addresses,3.0,521.0,6.0,2.3308613300323486

134,denial of service,"YES. 

The vulnerability lies in the `hashLoop` function, where a large number of iterations (`numTimes`) can be passed, leading to excessive gas consumption. This could result in a denial of service (DoS) by running out of gas during execution, making the contract unusable or causing transactions to fail due to exceeding the gas limit.",denial of service,3.0,505.0,6.0,3.6499006748199463
135,denial of service,"YES

The given smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. Specifically, the vulnerability still lies in the usage of `creditorAddresses = new address ;` (line 54) and `creditorAmounts = new uint ;` (line 56). Resetting these arrays when there are still creditors who should be paid out could lead to inconsistencies, as these addresses and amounts are essentially deleted. This can prevent legitimate creditors from being paid, leading to a denial of service for users who are expecting repayment. Additionally, the use of a loop (`hashLoop`) in the contract is also a potential issue since it could be computationally expensive, leading to gas exhaustion and further DoS vulnerabilities.",denial of service,4.0,580.0,6.0,2.8239479064941406
136,denial of service,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable because the same vulnerability from the original contract persists. In the `refundAll()` function, if any of the addresses in `refundAddresses` fails to receive a refund (due to the `send()` function returning false), the entire loop will stop due to the `require()` statement, resulting in a denial of service for the remaining addresses in the list.",denial of service,3.0,512.0,6.0,2.4992783069610596
137,denial of service,"YES, the second smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the **`hashLoop`** function. If the **`numTimes`** parameter is set to a very large value, the loop will consume a significant amount of gas, potentially leading to a denial of service by causing the function to fail due to running out of gas.",denial of service,3.0,503.0,6.0,3.1420626640319824
138,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the line:  
`require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));`

This is a typical **denial of service** vulnerability caused by the use of `send()`. If the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract with a fallback function that consumes more gas or reverts, the transaction will fail, preventing other participants from bidding and effectively locking the auction in a ""stuck"" state.",denial of service,3.0,527.0,6.0,1.7869682312011719
