The `MultiOwnable` contract has an access control vulnerability. Specifically, the `newOwner` function allows any address to be set as an owner by anyone, without proper authorization checks. This means any user can add themselves or another address as an owner, gaining unauthorized control over the contract.

Additionally, the `deleteOwner` function can be exploited since once an attacker adds themselves as an owner, they can subsequently remove legitimate owners, further compromising the contract's integrity. 

These access control issues make the contract vulnerable to unauthorized access and manipulation.",access control,3.0,544.0,6.0,3.894648313522339

- In the `IntegerOverflowMappingSym1` contract, the line `map[k] -= v;` can cause an underflow.

The smart contract is vulnerable to an integer overflow in the `run` function of the `IntegerOverflowMul` contract.
