73,front running,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the possibility of **front-running** during the `claimReward` function. An attacker could observe a legitimate user's transaction that satisfies the condition `submission < 10` and then submit their own transaction with a higher gas fee to claim the reward first. This allows them to exploit the contract by preempting the original transaction and claiming the reward, which is a typical front-running attack.",front running,3.0,522.0,6.0,2.075009822845459

126,reentrancy,"YES, the given smart contract is vulnerable because of the `withdrawBalance` function in the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract. The vulnerability lies in line 17 where the contract transfers funds using `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""");`. This call can trigger external code execution, allowing the caller to re-enter the contract and call `withdrawBalance` again before `userBalances[msg.sender]` is set to zero. This results in a reentrancy attack, potentially allowing the caller to drain the contract's funds.",reentrancy,3.0,541.0,6.0,3.865264892578125
127,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the use of `block.timestamp` for time-based logic in the `TimedCrowdsale` contract. This timestamp can be manipulated by miners within a certain range, leading to potential exploitation of the `isSaleFinished` function.",time manipulation,3.0,488.0,6.0,3.6206886768341064
128,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is present in the same lines as the initial contract:
1. **Line 13**: `if ( rand> 0 && now - rand > 24 hours ) {` - This line is vulnerable to timestamp manipulation since `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) can be influenced by miners. They could manipulate the time slightly to meet the condition.
   
2. **Line 27**: `return block.timestamp;` - This line uses `block.timestamp` as a random number generator, which is insecure because the timestamp can be manipulated by the miner, leading to predictable and exploitable randomness.",time manipulation,3.0,566.0,6.0,3.1136560440063477
129,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability is due to the use of `block.timestamp` in the `resetInvestment` function, which allows for time manipulation. Miners can manipulate the block's timestamp, enabling them to influence when the `resetInvestment` function can be called. This can allow the attacker to call `resetInvestment` earlier or later than intended, potentially benefiting from the jackpot or delaying its reset.",time manipulation,3.0,512.0,6.0,2.830677032470703
130,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of `now` (an alias for `block.timestamp`) in the `Roulette` contract. Since miners can manipulate block timestamps within a certain range, the `require(now != pastBlockTime)` check can be bypassed, allowing a malicious miner to control when `now % 15 == 0` is true and potentially drain the contract's balance by forcing payouts under favorable conditions.",time manipulation,3.0,523.0,6.0,2.1489980220794678
131,time manipulation,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` in line 43 to generate randomness. Since miners can manipulate the timestamp within a certain range, they can influence the outcome of the `random` value, which compromises the fairness of the lottery mechanism. This makes the contract susceptible to time manipulation attacks.",time manipulation,3.0,501.0,6.0,3.7440991401672363
132,short addresses,"YES, it is vulnerable.

",short addresses,3.0,439.0,6.0,2.9137237071990967
133,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the potential for **denial of service (DoS) by running out of gas** in the `emptyCreditors` function. When the `creditorAddresses` array grows too large, particularly above 1500 addresses, attempting to reset the array (`creditorAddresses = new address `) could consume more gas than is available, preventing the function from being executed and causing a denial of service.

Additionally, in the `balanceChecker` contract, the `checkBals` function could also lead to a denial of service if too many addresses are passed in, as it iterates over the `addrs` array and calls the `balanceOf` function in each iteration, potentially leading to a similar gas exhaustion issue.",denial of service,4.0,589.0,6.0,5.804600477218628
134,denial of service,"YES

The smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the loop that dynamically resizes the `array` and increases its length. When the array becomes too large, the gas required to execute the function grows significantly. This can cause the transaction to run out of gas, preventing the function from being executed. This leads to a denial of service, as legitimate users will no longer be able to call the function if the gas cost exceeds the block gas limit.",denial of service,3.0,543.0,6.0,2.081860065460205
135,denial of service,"YES

The contract is vulnerable due to a potential **Denial of Service** (DoS) attack at line 46 and line 48. Reinitializing `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` to empty arrays using `creditorAddresses = new address ;` and `creditorAmounts = new uint ;` can lead to the loss of creditor information, which prevents further processing of creditors' payouts or their involvement in future transactions. This could cause a denial of service for creditors expecting to be paid out from the contract.",denial of service,3.0,543.0,6.0,3.3251912593841553
136,denial of service,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable because in the `refundAll` function, it uses `send` to transfer funds to the addresses in the `refundAddresses` array. If any of the addresses' transfers fail (e.g., due to a malicious contract that refuses to accept ETH or consumes excessive gas), the entire transaction will revert, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). This means that even if other addresses can receive refunds, the failure of one will block all future refunds, creating a vulnerability to DoS attacks.",denial of service,3.0,541.0,6.0,2.462735414505005
137,denial of service,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable due to the same issue as in the first example. The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function, particularly in the `for` loop where it tries to push `msg.sender` 350 times into `listAddresses`. This can lead to a **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack by consuming excessive gas, which could prevent the function from completing if the gas limit is exceeded. Thus, the function may fail, and future users may be unable to interact with the contract effectively, resulting in a DoS situation.",denial of service,3.0,549.0,6.0,2.7338902950286865
138,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability exists due to the `currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid)` statement. If the recipient (the current frontrunner) is a contract with a fallback function that fails or consumes more than the provided gas, the `send` function will fail, causing the entire transaction to revert. This can result in a denial of service, preventing others from placing bids and locking the contract.",denial of service,3.0,515.0,6.0,3.115138530731201
