11,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function of the `MultiOwnable` contract. This function allows any external address to add a new owner without restriction beyond checking that the address is not `0`. Since there are no checks to ensure that only an authorized owner can call this function, an attacker can potentially add themselves as an owner, gaining unauthorized access to the contract's functionality.

",access control,3.0,519.0,6.0,2.902717351913452
12,access control,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to the following reasons:

1. **Access Control Vulnerability in `missing` function**: The constructor function `missing` should have been named `Missing` (following Solidity's convention in older versions where the constructor name must match the contract name). Because of this incorrect name, the function is not treated as the constructor and can be called by anyone to reset the owner to their own address. This allows an attacker to take control of the contract, including withdrawing the contract's balance.

",access control,3.0,538.0,6.0,3.150080919265747
13,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the constructor function of the `Rubixi` contract. The function `DynamicPyramid()` on line 23 acts as the contract's constructor. However, in Solidity version 0.4.15, constructors must have the same name as the contract itself. Since the contract is named `Rubixi` but the constructor is named `DynamicPyramid`, this causes the function to be considered a regular public function instead of a constructor. 

This means **anyone can call the `DynamicPyramid()` function and set themselves as the `creator`,** bypassing access control checks meant to restrict certain actions to the contract creator only.",access control,3.0,572.0,6.0,2.6839513778686523

The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function of the `Wallet` contract. The line:

```solidity
require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);
```

should instead be:

```solidity
require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);
```

Currently, the condition allows withdrawals only when the requested amount is greater than or equal to the balance, which is incorrect. This can lead to users not being able to withdraw their funds unless they request an amount greater than or equal to their balance, which is clearly a logic flaw that can be exploited.",access control,3.0,544.0,6.0,2.544997453689575
15,access control,"YES. The vulnerability exists because the `IamMissing` function allows anyone to set themselves as the owner of the contract.

Specifically, `delegatecall` is used in the `forward` function without proper restrictions or access controls. This allows any user to call arbitrary functions on the `callee` contract, potentially causing malicious actions or unauthorized state changes if the `callee` contract is not trusted or validated.

The vulnerability in the `Wallet` contract lies in the **lack of access control** for the `PushBonusCode`, `PopBonusCode`, and `UpdateBonusCodeAt` functions. Any user can call these functions to modify the `bonusCodes` array, which should likely be restricted to only the contract owner. 

Additionally, the line `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length);` in the `PopBonusCode` function is a redundant check since `bonusCodes.length` is always non-negative (as it is an unsigned integer), and reducing the length without ensuring proper control could lead to unexpected behavior.

The `CustomToken` contract does not introduce additional access control issues based on the provided code snippet. However, the core vulnerability lies within the `Wallet` contract's public functions.",access control,4.0,594.0,6.0,2.6923346519470215

The `Wallet` contract is vulnerable due to the public `initWallet` function. This allows anyone to call the function and become the `creator` of the contract, which grants them access to the privileged `migrateTo` function.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `tx.origin` for access control in the `sendTo` function. Using `tx.origin` to validate the owner is insecure because it can be exploited in a phishing attack. If a contract calls this function on behalf of the owner, `tx.origin` will be the original sender of the transaction, not the immediate caller, which can bypass the intended access control.

The smart contract is vulnerable due to an access control issue. Specifically, the function `refund()` allows anyone to call it and withdraw their full balance without any restriction or validation beyond them having a balance.

The vulnerability in the `Phishable` contract lies in the use of `tx.origin` for access control on line 20. This allows an attacker to perform a phishing attack by tricking the contract owner into interacting with a malicious contract, which then calls the `withdrawAll` function.

The vulnerability lies in the same `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract. The external call to `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""")` allows the caller's code to execute and potentially re-enter the `withdrawBalance` function before the user's balance is set to zero. This allows an attacker to drain the contract's funds by repeatedly calling the function before the balance is updated.",reentrancy,3.0,526.0,6.0,2.928048610687256
127,time manipulation,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` in the `isSaleFinished` function. The miner has control over the `block.timestamp` value, and they can manipulate it within a certain range, potentially leading to incorrect behavior in the contract, such as prematurely ending or extending the sale.",time manipulation,3.0,495.0,6.0,2.6602840423583984
128,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable because it still uses `block.timestamp` (line 27) for randomness generation, which can be manipulated by miners. Additionally, the condition `if (rand > 0 && now - rand > 24 hours)` (line 13) is vulnerable to time manipulation as well, since `now` (an alias for `block.timestamp`) is also miner-controlled. These two issues expose the contract to time manipulation attacks.",time manipulation,4.0,523.0,6.0,7.315096855163574
129,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability in the `Governmental` contract lies in its reliance on `block.timestamp` for timing logic. Specifically, in the `resetInvestment()` function, the contract checks if enough time has passed since the last investment by comparing `block.timestamp` with `lastInvestmentTimestamp + ONE_MINUTE`. Since miners can manipulate `block.timestamp` within a small range, they could exploit this by manipulating the timestamp to reset the investment earlier or later than intended, leading to potential exploitation of the contract's logic.",time manipulation,3.0,536.0,6.0,3.644019365310669
130,time manipulation,"YES

The vulnerability in the `Roulette` contract persists because it still relies on `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`), which can be manipulated by miners. Specifically:

1. **Line 18**: `require(now != pastBlockTime);` depends on the block's timestamp. Miners can adjust the timestamp within a range, thus affecting this condition.
2. **Line 20**: `pastBlockTime = now;` continues the reliance on the miner-controlled timestamp, making it vulnerable to manipulation.

This type of vulnerability is categorized as **time manipulation**.",time manipulation,3.0,552.0,6.0,3.378753900527954
131,time manipulation,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the following line:

```solidity
var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;
```

This uses `block.timestamp` for generating randomness, which is manipulable by miners. Since miners can influence the block timestamp, they have the ability to skew the results of the random number generation, making the contract susceptible to time manipulation attacks.",time manipulation,3.0,516.0,6.0,3.418487071990967
132,short addresses,"YES. The contract is vulnerable to a short address attack due to the potential for improperly padded arguments when calling the `sendCoin` function, as the contract doesn't enforce proper argument padding validation. This could allow an attacker to manipulate transaction data and exploit the vulnerability.",short addresses,3.0,485.0,6.0,5.620857238769531
133,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `emptyCreditors` function. Specifically, when the `creditorAddresses.length > 1500`, the contract attempts to reset the array with `creditorAddresses = new address ;`. This operation could consume a large amount of gas if the array grows significantly in size, potentially making the transaction run out of gas. This can lead to a denial of service, preventing the function from being executed successfully.",denial of service,3.0,522.0,6.0,3.605224132537842
134,denial of service,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the loop inside the `insertNnumbers` function. Specifically:

1. **Denial of Service due to Gas Limit**: The loop (`for(uint i=0;i<numbers;i++)`) that resizes the array and adds elements can run indefinitely depending on the input value of `numbers`. As the array grows, dynamically increasing its length within the loop becomes more gas-expensive. Eventually, this can lead to the transaction exceeding the block gas limit, making the function unable to complete. This can prevent the contract from executing future operations, leading to a Denial of Service. 

Thus, the contract is vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack, particularly related to gas limits.",denial of service,3.0,582.0,6.0,2.7096972465515137

137,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack through gas limits. Specifically, the issue is within the `ifillArray` function in the `DosOneFunc` contract:

- In the loop on line 17 (`for(uint i=0;i<350;i++)`), the function appends addresses to the `listAddresses` array.
- If the array size grows large enough (up to the limit of 1500 elements), calling this function may require more gas than is allowed in a single transaction.
- Eventually, the gas cost to process this function will exceed the block gas limit, causing a denial of service because the function will become uncallable when the gas limit is reached.

This makes the contract vulnerable to being frozen, preventing further interactions and causing a DoS condition.",denial of service,3.0,605.0,6.0,2.9149820804595947
138,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the same issue: a potential denial of service (DoS) vulnerability in the `DosAuction` contract. Specifically, the line `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` can fail if the `currentFrontrunner` address is a contract that has a fallback function which deliberately fails or uses all gas. This would prevent further bids from being processed, resulting in a DoS attack.",denial of service,3.0,525.0,6.0,1.9060919284820557
