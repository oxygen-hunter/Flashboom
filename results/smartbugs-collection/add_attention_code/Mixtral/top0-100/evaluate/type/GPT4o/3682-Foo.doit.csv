Low-level calls like `call()` return a boolean value, but in this case, it is not being checked, which can lead to unwanted behaviors or vulnerabilities, such as allowing the contract to proceed even if the call failed.

Additionally, in the `doit()` function of the `Foo` contract, while the return value of `token.transfer()` is checked with `require()`, the code is vulnerable if the ERC20 token contract does not strictly follow the ERC20 standard and could return a false value without reverting, leading to a failed transfer not being handled properly.",unchecked low level calls,4.0,578.0,6.0,3.98193621635437

The vulnerability lies in the `addr.call.value(0 wei)();` statement in the `getTokens` function. This low-level call does not check the return value, meaning that if the call fails, the contract execution will continue without recognizing the failure. This can lead to fail-open scenarios, where errors are not handled correctly, potentially allowing attackers to exploit the contract by calling functions that should have reverted.

   - This is a low-level call to transfer tokens using `call()`. The return value of the `call()` function is not checked, which means that if the call fails, it will not revert the transaction, and the execution will continue, potentially leading to fund loss or other unintended behaviors.

2. **Line 97 in the original contract**: `_addr.call.value(_wei);`
   - Similar to the previous point, this low-level call sends Ether to an address using `call()`, and again, the return value is not checked. If the call fails, Ether might not be sent, but the contract will proceed, which could be exploited.

The vulnerability in the given smart contract is related to front-running. Specifically:

- In the `EthTxOrderDependenceMinimal` contract, the functions `setReward()` and `claimReward(uint256 submission)` both have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by front-running attacks. This occurs because both functions involve transferring rewards (`owner.transfer(reward)` and `msg.sender.transfer(reward)`), and their conditions are based on publicly visible state variables like `claimed`. Miners or other users can observe the pending transaction on the network and submit a competing transaction with higher gas fees to claim the reward before the original transaction is mined.

The vulnerability lies in the `solve` function of the `FindThisHash` contract. Since the solution is submitted as a plain string, an attacker could observe the solution in a pending transaction on the blockchain and submit the same solution with a higher gas fee, front-running the original transaction. This would allow the attacker to claim the reward of 1000 ether before the original user, making the contract vulnerable to front-running attacks.",front running,3.0,525.0,6.0,4.787984132766724
75,front running,"YES, the second smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability exists due to the front-running risk in the `doit` function of the `Foo` contract.

The vulnerability lies in the `IntegerOverflowMappingSym1` contract, specifically in line 16: `map[k] -= v;`. This can lead to an underflow, where subtracting a large value from a smaller one results in an incorrect value due to the limitations of unsigned integers in Solidity.

Additionally, in the `Foo` contract, there is a potential vulnerability in the `doit` function. The balance of the address `0xA63409Bed5Cde1Befd8565aCF4702759058Ad585` is transferred without any checks on the balance, which can lead to security issues if the `transfer` function fails or does not handle edge cases properly.",arithmetic,4.0,581.0,6.0,2.5065884590148926

This can allow a reentrancy attack, where an attacker could recursively call the `withdrawAll` function before the state is updated, draining the contract's funds.",reentrancy,3.0,509.0,6.0,2.6664249897003174
113,reentrancy,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance()` function of the `EtherBank` contract. It is susceptible to a reentrancy attack because the call to `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)()` sends funds to an external address before updating the user's balance. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the `withdrawBalance()` function and drain funds from the contract before the balance is set to zero. The state should be updated (i.e., set `userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;`) before making the external call to prevent reentrancy.",reentrancy,3.0,553.0,6.0,3.136059284210205
114,reentrancy,"YES, it is vulnerable because the `CashOut` function uses the low-level `call` function on line 41: `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())`. This opens up the possibility of a **reentrancy attack**. An attacker can repeatedly call the `CashOut` function before the balance is updated (which happens after the call), allowing them to drain the contract's funds.",reentrancy,3.0,516.0,6.0,2.7485554218292236
115,reentrancy,"YES

The vulnerability in the first contract (`ETH_VAULT`) is a classic reentrancy attack. The `CashOut` function allows external calls to `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` before updating the user's balance (`balances[msg.sender]-=_am`). This can allow an attacker to repeatedly withdraw funds before the balance is properly updated, exploiting the contract by making multiple withdrawals in a single transaction.

The second contract (`Foo`) does not seem to have a reentrancy vulnerability based on the provided code, but the first contract is vulnerable due to the reentrancy issue.",reentrancy,3.0,552.0,6.0,3.0290703773498535
116,reentrancy,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `Collect` function, which can lead to a reentrancy attack. An attacker could exploit this by recursively calling the `Collect` function before the contract state is updated, allowing them to withdraw more funds than they are entitled to.",reentrancy,3.0,505.0,6.0,3.665261745452881
117,reentrancy,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability arises from the `withdrawBalance()` function, which uses the low-level `call` function `(bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""")`. This allows the external caller's code to execute before the state of the contract is updated (i.e., before `userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;` is executed). An attacker can exploit this by re-entering the contract and repeatedly calling `withdrawBalance()` to drain funds before the balance is reset to zero, causing a reentrancy attack.",reentrancy,3.0,548.0,6.0,2.8308322429656982
118,reentrancy,YES. The vulnerability is present due to the reentrancy attack in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrance` contract. The function uses `msg.sender.call.value()` without updating the user balance before making the external call. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the function and drain the contract before the balance is reset.,reentrancy,3.0,502.0,6.0,3.5458526611328125
119,reentrancy,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the same section as the previous example, in the `CashOut` function (line 52):

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This is a low-level call that sends Ether to `msg.sender` without using `transfer` or `send`, which would automatically limit gas. The use of `.call.value()` allows the receiving contract (an external one) to reenter the `CashOut` function before the `balances[msg.sender]` is updated, thus allowing repeated withdrawals, leading to a reentrancy attack.",reentrancy,3.0,557.0,6.0,3.2052106857299805
120,reentrancy,"YES

The second smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack due to the use of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `CashOut` function, which allows external calls. This low-level call can lead to a reentrancy attack, as it gives the external contract an opportunity to re-enter the `CashOut` function before the state (i.e., balances) is updated. Therefore, an attacker could repeatedly withdraw funds before the balance is reduced, draining the contract.",reentrancy,3.0,536.0,6.0,3.1724727153778076

122,reentrancy,"YES. The vulnerability in the `Private_Bank` contract lies in the `CashOut` function. It uses a low-level `call` function (`if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())`) to transfer Ether, which is susceptible to a reentrancy attack. An attacker could repeatedly call the `CashOut` function before the balance is updated, allowing them to drain funds from the contract.",reentrancy,3.0,515.0,6.0,3.99479079246521
123,reentrancy,"**YES**: The vulnerability is a reentrancy attack in the `Collect` function, specifically at the line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This line allows an external call to be made to the `msg.sender` before the contractâ€™s state (i.e., the balance of the account) is updated. This means that an attacker could re-enter the contract during this call and repeatedly withdraw funds by recursively calling `Collect` before the balance is updated, draining the contract of its funds.",reentrancy,3.0,542.0,6.0,2.8226895332336426
124,reentrancy,"YES. The contract is vulnerable due to the reentrancy attack in the `CashOut` function. The line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

allows an external contract to call back into the `CashOut` function before the initial execution is complete. This can be exploited by repeatedly calling the function and draining funds before the contract's balance is updated.",reentrancy,3.0,514.0,6.0,2.1225574016571045
125,reentrancy,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the use of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `Collect` function. This low-level call can enable a reentrancy attack, allowing an external contract to call back into the `Collect` function before the balance is updated, potentially draining funds from the contract.",reentrancy,3.0,497.0,6.0,2.415604591369629

127,time manipulation,"YES. The contract is vulnerable to time manipulation because it uses `block.timestamp` in the `TimedCrowdsale` contract to determine if the sale is finished. Miners can manipulate the block timestamp slightly, potentially exploiting this to trigger or delay the sale ending.",time manipulation,3.0,486.0,6.0,2.8550405502319336

129,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` in the `Governmental` contract. Specifically, miners can manipulate `block.timestamp`, which is used in the `resetInvestment` function to check the time difference since the last investment. This reliance on a manipulable value can lead to timing attacks, making the contract susceptible to exploitation by an attacker who can influence the timing logic.",time manipulation,3.0,516.0,6.0,6.812946796417236
130,time manipulation,"YES, the vulnerability still exists in the `Roulette` contract because it relies on the `now` (or `block.timestamp`) value for critical logic. Specifically:

- In line 18, `require(now != pastBlockTime);` allows only one transaction per block, but since miners can manipulate the `block.timestamp`, they can exploit this condition.
- In line 20, `pastBlockTime = now;` stores the current block time, which can also be manipulated by miners to their advantage.

Thus, the contract is vulnerable to time manipulation exploits.",time manipulation,3.0,547.0,6.0,3.2928273677825928
131,time manipulation,"YES

The vulnerability in the smart contract is due to the use of `block.timestamp` for randomness in the `EtherLotto` contract (line 43: `var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;`). The value of `block.timestamp` can be influenced by miners to some extent, which makes it insecure for generating random values. This creates an opportunity for miners to manipulate the outcome of the lottery, especially if they can benefit from winning.",time manipulation,3.0,529.0,6.0,3.4454174041748047

133,denial of service,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function in the `DosGas` contract. Specifically, when the length of `creditorAddresses` exceeds 1500, the contract attempts to reset the array by setting `creditorAddresses = new address `. This operation can consume an excessive amount of gas, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors and preventing the function from being successfully executed, thus making the contract susceptible to a denial of service attack.",denial of service,3.0,536.0,6.0,2.8274121284484863
134,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability in the first contract stems from the loop in the `insertNnumbers` function. This loop dynamically increases the size of the array during runtime by incrementing `array.length`. This can lead to excessive gas consumption, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if the function call runs out of gas before completion.

In the second contract, while it has a new `doit` function, the vulnerability still exists within the `insertNnumbers` function for the same reasons: dynamically resizing the array can lead to DoS through gas exhaustion.",denial of service,3.0,549.0,6.0,2.6591274738311768
135,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability is in the `Foo` contract. It contains a potential **Denial of Service (DoS)** vulnerability because the `token.transfer()` call sends the entire balance of the token contract (using `token.balanceOf()`), and if the recipient is a contract that rejects or misbehaves when receiving tokens, it could cause the transaction to fail and prevent the function from completing.

This DoS risk arises from relying on external calls to untrusted contracts (such as another contract as the beneficiary) without checking the behavior or outcome.",denial of service,3.0,544.0,6.0,3.103771209716797
136,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function of the `Refunder` contract, where the use of `send` can lead to a **Denial of Service (DoS)**. If one address in `refundAddresses` fails to receive the refund (e.g., due to gas limitations or malicious behavior), the entire loop will stop, preventing any further refunds. Additionally, the `Foo` contract also has a potential vulnerability because it uses `require` on `token.transfer`, which could similarly cause a DoS if the transfer fails.",denial of service,4.0,546.0,6.0,2.7718260288238525
137,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function in the `DosOneFunc` contract. The for-loop inside this function pushes the sender's address into the `listAddresses` array 350 times, which can lead to high gas consumption as the size of the array grows. Once the gas limit is exceeded, the function can no longer be executed, leading to a denial of service.

Additionally, the `doit` function in the `Foo` contract depends on the `transfer` method of the `IERC20Token` token. If the token transfer fails or consumes too much gas, it could also result in a denial of service in this function.",denial of service,4.0,573.0,6.0,3.225080728530884
138,denial of service,"YES. It is vulnerable because the `currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid)` in the `DosAuction` contract can fail if the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that does not accept Ether or has a fallback function that consumes a large amount of gas. This would block the bid process, resulting in a denial of service for future bids.",denial of service,3.0,507.0,6.0,2.5400848388671875
