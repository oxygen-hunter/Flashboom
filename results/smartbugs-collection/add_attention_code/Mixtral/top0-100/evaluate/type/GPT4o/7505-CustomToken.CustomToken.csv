The contract is vulnerable due to improper access control in the `newOwner` function.

In the `CustomToken` contract, the `Transfer` event is emitted but the Solidity event syntax changed after version 0.4.21 to require the use of `emit`. Without this, the event is not properly emitted, potentially causing discrepancies in how transfers are tracked externally.

Additionally, there is no access control mechanism in place, which can expose functionality to unauthorized users. For example, anyone could potentially call functions that alter token balances.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the function `Constructor()` is not recognized as a constructor in Solidity versions before 0.5.0.

The contract is vulnerable due to the improper use of `delegatecall` in the `withdraw` and fallback functions. Specifically, the access control vulnerability arises from the `delegatecall` in line 31 and line 38. 

In line 31, the `withdraw` function makes a delegate call to the `fibonacciLibrary`, executing the `setFibonacci` function. However, this could be exploited if the attacker controls the `fibonacciLibrary` contract, as they could manipulate the `calculatedFibNumber` value, causing the contract to transfer an incorrect amount of ether. 

In line 38, the fallback function also uses `delegatecall` with the `msg.data`, which opens the possibility for an attacker to send arbitrary data to the `fibonacciLibrary` and potentially manipulate the state or behavior of the contract.

The use of `delegatecall` in proxy contracts, especially with user-controlled input, leads to the vulnerability of allowing attackers to execute unintended logic in the context of the calling contract.

2. **Line 97**: `_addr.call.value(_wei);` – Similarly, the result of this low-level `call` is not checked, which can also lead to unintended outcomes if the call fails.

This low-level call does not check the return value. If the call fails, the funds are still considered withdrawn since the balance is reset to zero right after.

The vulnerability in the provided code lies in the `sendMoney` function in the `SimpleWallet` contract. Specifically, the following line of code:

```solidity
_target.call.value(_value)();
```

This is a low-level call, and its return value is not checked. As mentioned, low-level calls like `call()` do not propagate errors, meaning if the call fails (e.g., due to the target contract not having enough gas or being in an invalid state), it won't revert the transaction or signal failure. Instead, it simply returns `false`, and the contract continues execution, which can lead to unexpected behavior or financial loss.

To fix this vulnerability, the return value of `call()` should be checked to ensure that the transaction was successful, like so:

```solidity
require(_target.call.value(_value)());
``` 

This ensures the transaction reverts if the call fails, making the contract more secure.",unchecked low level calls,3.0,626.0,6.0,3.8245186805725098

This line allows an external call to the sender's contract (using the low-level `call` function) before updating the balance of the sender. As a result, an attacker could reenter the contract and drain funds by repeatedly calling `Collect` before the balance is updated.",reentrancy,3.0,531.0,6.0,3.989274263381958
126,reentrancy,"YES

The smart contract `Reentrancy_insecure` in the second code block contains the same reentrancy vulnerability as the first one. The issue lies in line 17, where `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""");` allows the external address (i.e., the caller) to re-enter the contract by calling `withdrawBalance` again before the function has finished execution and before the user's balance is set to zero. This vulnerability can be exploited to drain the contract's funds through multiple reentrant calls.",reentrancy,3.0,539.0,6.0,2.7700178623199463

129,time manipulation,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` (line 27 in the first `Governmental` contract) for time-based logic, which can be manipulated by miners.",time manipulation,3.0,471.0,6.0,3.1407155990600586
130,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `Roulette` contract because it relies on `now` (an alias for `block.timestamp`) for important logic, such as determining when a payout should occur (lines 18 and 20). As explained earlier, miners can manipulate the block timestamp, which can lead to vulnerabilities like time manipulation and can be exploited, especially when randomness or timing-based conditions are involved. This makes the contract susceptible to exploitation by miners adjusting the block's timestamp to trigger certain outcomes, like winning the balance transfer in the `Roulette` game.",time manipulation,3.0,552.0,6.0,2.92928409576416
131,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` for randomness generation, which can be manipulated by miners. In this case, the line `var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;` introduces weak randomness, making the contract susceptible to time manipulation by miners, allowing them to influence the outcome of the lottery.",time manipulation,3.0,507.0,6.0,4.05911660194397

133,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability exists due to a potential gas exhaustion issue in the `DosGas` contract. Specifically, the function `emptyCreditors` can fail due to the large size of the `creditorAddresses` array, as resetting an array with more than 1500 elements may consume more gas than is allowed for a transaction. This can lead to a denial of service, preventing the `emptyCreditors` function from completing.",denial of service,3.0,521.0,6.0,3.3839662075042725
134,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability in the `DosNumber` contract arises from the loop inside the `insertNnumbers` function, which dynamically increases the size of the `array`. This process can consume excessive gas, leading to a denial of service attack (DoS). Specifically:

- **Line 18** (`for(uint i=0;i<numbers;i++)`): The loop can run for a potentially large number of iterations, each time increasing the array's length.
- **Line 19** (`if(numElements == array.length)`): If the array reaches its maximum capacity, this condition is checked repeatedly.
- **Line 20** (`array.length += 1`): Dynamically increasing the array length is gas-intensive, and doing so repeatedly can cause the transaction to fail due to gas limits.

Thus, the smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to excessive gas consumption when inserting a large number of elements into the array.",denial of service,3.0,624.0,6.0,3.2419519424438477
135,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `Government` contract, specifically in the following lines:

1. **Line 46: `creditorAddresses = new address ;`**
2. **Line 48: `creditorAmounts = new uint ;`**

By resetting the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays to empty, any pending creditors who haven't been paid yet will be unable to recover their funds. This can lead to a **Denial of Service** (DoS) attack, where legitimate creditors are blocked from receiving their owed payments because their data is erased before payout completion.",denial of service,3.0,556.0,6.0,2.5489423274993896
136,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll()` function in the `Refunder` contract. If the `send()` function fails for any address in the `refundAddresses` array, it will revert the entire transaction, preventing the function from processing refunds for the remaining addresses. This can be exploited to create a denial of service, as a single failure can block all future refunds.",denial of service,3.0,517.0,6.0,3.169290542602539
137,denial of service,"YES

The contract is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. In the function `ifillArray()`, the loop on line 17 (`for(uint i=0;i<350;i++)`) can consume significant gas. If the `listAddresses` array grows larger, the function will require more gas to execute, and users may not be able to fill the array when it gets larger. This could effectively block other users from interacting with the contract, causing a denial of service.",denial of service,3.0,536.0,6.0,3.212948799133301
138,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability exists due to the use of `currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid)` in the `DosAuction` contract. The `send` function only forwards 2300 gas to the recipient, which may be insufficient if the recipient's fallback function is complex or if the recipient is a contract. If the `send` operation fails, the entire `bid` function will revert, preventing further bids. This creates a denial of service (DoS) scenario, as the contract can become locked, preventing any new bids from being accepted.
