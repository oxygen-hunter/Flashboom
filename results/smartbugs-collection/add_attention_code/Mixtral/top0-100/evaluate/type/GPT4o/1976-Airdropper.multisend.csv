12,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `onlyOwner` modifier and the `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract. Although the `onlyOwner` modifier is used to restrict access to the function, the issue arises because the `Ownable` contract does not set an initial owner. If the `owner` variable in `Ownable` is not initialized properly, anyone can call `multisend` before ownership is assigned, potentially allowing unauthorized users to execute the function and transfer tokens. This is an access control vulnerability.",access control,3.0,544.0,6.0,2.965543508529663

14,access control,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable because the `withdraw` function contains an incorrect condition on line 16:

```solidity
require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);
```

This allows users to withdraw more than their balance, leading to potential fund drains. Additionally, the contract lacks proper access control measures for critical functions like the `withdraw` and `migrateTo` functions, making it prone to attacks targeting access control.",access control,4.0,518.0,6.0,4.1913979053497314
15,access control,"YES. The vulnerability in the code relates to access control, particularly with the function `IamMissing()` in the `Missing` contract. This function allows any user to reset the owner of the contract by calling it, which leads to unauthorized access and control over the contract. This means anyone can take ownership by invoking `IamMissing()`, and subsequently withdraw funds using the `withdraw()` function.

Furthermore, in the `Airdropper` contract, while the `onlyOwner` modifier is used, the `multisend` function performs a loop over user-provided addresses (`dests`) and values (`values`), which could lead to high gas costs, potentially causing a failure due to gas limits if too many addresses are provided.

17,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `delegatecall` in the `Proxy` contract (line 19). `delegatecall` is dangerous because it executes the code of the called contract in the context of the caller's storage, meaning any untrusted contract could manipulate the storage of the `Proxy` contract, potentially altering critical variables like the `owner`. This can result in access control issues where unauthorized entities can take control of the contract or execute malicious code.",access control,3.0,531.0,6.0,2.7037289142608643
18,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the lack of access control on certain functions in the `Wallet` contract. Specifically:

1. The `PushBonusCode`, `PopBonusCode`, and `UpdateBonusCodeAt` functions can be called by anyone, allowing unauthorized parties to manipulate the bonus codes. These functions should have proper access control to restrict access, such as an `onlyOwner` modifier.

2. The `PopBonusCode` function decrements the `bonusCodes.length` without clearing or checking the last element, potentially allowing manipulation of the internal state of the contract.

Additionally, the `Airdropper` contract in combination with the `Ownable` contract could also have vulnerabilities if the ownership of the contract is not properly managed or transferred.

Since this function is `public`, it allows anyone to call it and set themselves as the `creator`, giving them full control of the contract, including transferring all funds with the `migrateTo` function. 

Additionally, the `Airdropper` contract contains an access control vulnerability due to the use of an `onlyOwner` modifier that can be bypassed if ownership is not securely initialized or transferred, as the `owner` address is set publicly.",access control,4.0,545.0,6.0,2.7529330253601074
21,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `tx.origin == owner` in the `sendTo` function. This is an access control vulnerability because using `tx.origin` to validate ownership can be exploited in a phishing attack, where the attacker tricks the owner into calling a malicious contract that subsequently calls this contract. Instead of validating the caller with `msg.sender`, which is more secure, the contract incorrectly relies on `tx.origin`, leading to potential compromise in ownership checks.",access control,3.0,532.0,6.0,2.8276641368865967
22,access control,"YES. 

The vulnerability lies in the `refund()` function of the `Wallet` contract. It allows any user to call `msg.sender.transfer(balances[msg.sender]);` and withdraw their entire balance without any restriction or condition beyond having a balance. This could lead to potential misuse or unintended behavior, as there is no additional access control to ensure only authorized users can execute such functions. Furthermore, there is no control on who can call the `migrateTo()` function, allowing the contract's entire balance to be transferred to any arbitrary address.",access control,4.0,543.0,6.0,3.8594672679901123
23,access control,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to an **access control** issue in the `SimpleSuicide` contract. Specifically, the `sudicideAnyone()` function allows **anyone** to call the `selfdestruct(msg.sender)` function, which transfers the contract's remaining balance to the caller's address. Since there is no restriction on who can invoke this function, it creates a serious vulnerability by enabling any attacker to destroy the contract and steal any funds it holds.",access control,3.0,529.0,6.0,3.671243906021118

25,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `Phishable` contract, specifically with the `require(tx.origin == owner)` check in the `withdrawAll` function. Using `tx.origin` for access control can be exploited in phishing attacks, where an attacker tricks the contract owner into calling a malicious contract that calls `withdrawAll` indirectly. Since `tx.origin` refers to the original sender of the transaction, the attacker's contract can pass this check, allowing unauthorized access to withdraw funds.

This vulnerability is a form of access control issue, as the check relies on `tx.origin` instead of using `msg.sender`, which is more secure in such cases.",access control,3.0,568.0,6.0,3.5300419330596924
26,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `FibonacciBalance` contract's use of `delegatecall` to the `fibonacciLibrary` address in both `withdraw` and the fallback function. This is an access control vulnerability because `delegatecall` executes code in the context of the caller's contract, meaning that an attacker can potentially change the `fibonacciLibrary` address to point to a malicious contract, gaining control over the state of the `FibonacciBalance` contract, including variables like `calculatedFibNumber` and `withdrawalCounter`.",access control,3.0,544.0,6.0,2.6710734367370605
27,unchecked low level calls,"YES. 

The vulnerability lies in the `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);` function in the `Pie` contract, which uses a low-level call without checking the return value. This can lead to potential issues, such as failing to handle errors correctly, as the return value of the `call()` is not being verified.

In the **Freebie contract**:
- The `Command` function at line 39 uses `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);` without checking the return value of the low-level call. This can lead to vulnerabilities because the `call` function returns a boolean indicating success or failure, but this result is ignored. If the call fails, it will not stop the transaction or revert the state, which can lead to undesired behavior or fund loss.

In the **Airdropper contract**:
- There is no specific vulnerability related to unchecked low-level calls in the code provided.

The smart contract code is vulnerable due to the presence of potential front-running attacks in the `claimReward` and `setReward` functions. Specifically:

1. **Front-running in `setReward` (line 23):** When `owner.transfer(reward)` is executed, miners or external users can observe the reward amount in pending transactions and attempt to manipulate the sequence of transactions by offering higher gas fees, allowing them to intercept the reward.

2. **Front-running in `claimReward` (line 31):** Similarly, the `msg.sender.transfer(reward)` function is vulnerable to front-running, as an attacker could see a claim being submitted and submit a competing transaction with higher gas fees, potentially stealing the reward before the original transaction completes.

These vulnerabilities allow malicious users to exploit the order of transaction execution by front-running, hence making the contract unsafe.",front running,3.0,608.0,6.0,3.481076955795288

This allows miners to manipulate the timestamp, which could affect the sale's end time. This time manipulation vulnerability could lead to unexpected outcomes in the contract's behavior.",time manipulation,3.0,491.0,6.0,5.060962677001953
128,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in two parts:
1. In line 13: `if ( rand> 0 && now - rand > 24 hours )` — This relies on `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`), which can be manipulated by miners within a certain range. Miners can adjust the block timestamp to exploit time-sensitive logic.
   
2. In line 27: `return block.timestamp;` — Using `block.timestamp` for generating random numbers introduces bad randomness. The block timestamp can be influenced by miners, making it unsafe for generating randomness in a smart contract.",time manipulation,3.0,557.0,6.0,2.7718350887298584

130,time manipulation,NO,time manipulation,1.0,435.0,6.0,3.9177846908569336
131,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` for generating randomness in the EtherLotto contract, which can be manipulated by miners. The line `var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;` makes the contract susceptible to time manipulation and bad randomness vulnerabilities.",time manipulation,4.0,493.0,6.0,2.387394905090332
132,short addresses,"YES. 

The vulnerability in the given smart contract code relates to the potential for **short address attacks** when using the `transfer` function in the `Airdropper` contract. Specifically:

1. The function `multisend` in the `Airdropper` contract takes an array of destination addresses and values, but the function call `ERC20(_tokenAddr).transfer(dests[i], 10**15 * values[i])` can be exploited by using improperly padded arguments, leading to a **short address attack**.

This type of attack can occur due to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) accepting incorrectly padded arguments, which can be used to manipulate the encoded data for the transaction, resulting in a discrepancy in the transferred values.",short addresses,3.0,586.0,6.0,3.3303380012512207
133,denial of service,"YES

It is vulnerable because the `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract has a potential **denial of service** (DoS) vulnerability due to unbounded iteration in the `while` loop. If the `dests` array is very large, the gas required to complete the transaction may exceed the block gas limit, causing the transaction to fail. Consequently, this could lead to a denial of service for users attempting to call the function with a large number of recipients.",denial of service,3.0,537.0,6.0,3.204610586166382
134,denial of service,"YES

The contract is vulnerable to a ""Denial of Service"" (DoS) attack due to the possibility of exhausting the gas limit during the `insertNnumbers` function. This happens because the contract dynamically increases the length of the `array` in a loop, potentially causing an out-of-gas error as `array.length += 1` can lead to high gas consumption, especially with large input sizes.

Additionally, in the `Airdropper` contract, the `multisend` function can also lead to a denial of service if `dests.length` is large, as looping through many addresses and performing token transfers could run out of gas before completion.",denial of service,4.0,571.0,6.0,3.2322280406951904
135,denial of service,NO,denial of service,1.0,436.0,6.0,5.024933099746704
136,denial of service,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the same denial of service pattern in the `Refunder` contract, where the `refundAll` function uses `send`. If any of the `send` calls fail (for example, due to insufficient gas or a fallback function that reverts), the entire loop will stop, causing a denial of service. This means that a single failing address can block refunds to all others.

Additionally, in the `Airdropper` contract, there is no explicit vulnerability from a denial of service perspective in the code provided. However, the looping structure in `multisend` could potentially be inefficient for large arrays, which may lead to gas limit issues, but that is not necessarily classified as denial of service in this specific context.",denial of service,4.0,591.0,6.0,2.2588281631469727
137,denial of service,"YES

It is vulnerable due to the loop in the `multisend` function, where a large number of addresses in the `dests` array can result in high gas consumption, potentially causing the transaction to run out of gas and fail. This creates a denial of service for legitimate users.",denial of service,3.0,494.0,6.0,2.6047489643096924
138,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` line in the `DosAuction` contract. This pattern can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that refuses to accept the funds or if the gas required to send the funds exceeds the gas limit. In such cases, the `bid()` function will revert, preventing other users from placing bids and effectively locking the auction.",denial of service,3.0,537.0,6.0,3.736696481704712
