The vulnerability exists in the `newOwner` function of the `MultiOwnable` contract. It allows any external user to add a new owner without restriction. There is no access control mechanism in place to limit who can call this function, which means anyone can add themselves as an owner and potentially exploit the contract's permissions.

The vulnerability lies in the `missing()` function, which is a public function and allows anyone to call it and change the owner of the contract to themselves.

The vulnerability lies in the constructor function `DynamicPyramid()` (lines 23-25). In Solidity versions before 0.4.22, constructors have the same name as the contract.

The smart contract is vulnerable due to improper access control. In the `Map` contract, the `set` function allows any user to modify the `map` array without restriction. There is no access control mechanism limiting who can call the `set` function, allowing unauthorized users to modify the `map` data.

Additionally, in the `CustomToken` contract, the constructor does not provide proper access control for the token supply allocation.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `PopBonusCode()` function allows anyone to call it, reducing the length of the `bonusCodes` array without any access control. This can lead to unintended manipulation of the contract's state by unauthorized users.

The vulnerability lies in the function named `Constructor()`. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, constructors are defined with the same name as the contract.

The contract is vulnerable due to the reckless use of `delegatecall` in two places:

1. **Line 31**: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(fibSig, withdrawalCounter));`
   - This line allows the `FibonacciBalance` contract to delegate execution to the external `fibonacciLibrary` contract. Since `delegatecall` runs the external code in the context of the calling contract, this can lead to security issues if the external contract is malicious or can be changed.

2. **Line 38**: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(msg.data));`
   - This fallback function allows any call to be delegated to the `fibonacciLibrary` contract with arbitrary data, further exposing the contract to potential security issues, such as unauthorized control or manipulation of the contract’s state.

Both uses of `delegatecall` represent access control vulnerabilities because they can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the `FibonacciBalance` contract.",access control,3.0,631.0,6.0,2.5580546855926514

129,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the use of `block.timestamp` on line 27 in the `Governmental` contract. This creates a vulnerability to timestamp manipulation, where miners can manipulate the block's timestamp within a certain range to gain advantage. This could be exploited to reset the investment earlier or delay it for the attacker's benefit.",time manipulation,3.0,503.0,6.0,3.880582571029663
130,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the same part of the code as explained earlier, specifically in the `Roulette` contract:

- **Line 18**: `require(now != pastBlockTime);`  
   This is vulnerable to miner manipulation because miners can adjust the block timestamp, potentially allowing them to bypass the `require` condition and manipulate the outcome.
  
- **Line 20**: `pastBlockTime = now;`  
   Storing the current time, which is subject to manipulation by miners, makes it unreliable for critical functionality such as determining the winner of the roulette game (line 22: `if(now % 15 == 0)`), further exposing the contract to exploitation.",time manipulation,3.0,581.0,6.0,2.690126657485962
131,time manipulation,"YES

The contract is vulnerable because it relies on `block.timestamp` in line 43 to generate a random number. As mentioned, miners can manipulate the block's timestamp to influence the outcome of this random number generation, leading to potential exploitation in the lottery system.",time manipulation,3.0,486.0,6.0,3.175276517868042

",short addresses,3.0,435.0,6.0,4.163570404052734
133,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `emptyCreditors()` function within the `DosGas` contract. Specifically:

1. **Denial of Service (DoS) via Gas Limit**: The line `creditorAddresses = new address ;` inside `emptyCreditors()` can lead to a DoS vulnerability. If the `creditorAddresses` array becomes too large (e.g., well beyond 1500 addresses), attempting to clear this array would require an excessive amount of gas. This may result in the transaction running out of gas and failing, preventing the function from being executed.

This would effectively block users from calling this function and cause the contract to be stuck in an unusable state.",denial of service,3.0,575.0,6.0,3.3916897773742676
134,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the function `insertNnumbers`. The dynamic resizing of the array in lines 19-21:

```solidity
if(numElements == array.length) {
    array.length += 1;
}
array[numElements++] = value;
```

This causes the contract to consume more gas as the array grows. If the array becomes large, the gas required to execute the function increases significantly, eventually exceeding the block gas limit. This would lead to a denial of service (DoS) as the `insertNnumbers` function would fail to execute once the gas limit is reached.",denial of service,3.0,560.0,6.0,3.405869483947754
135,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `lendGovernmentMoney` function within the `Government` contract. Specifically, the lines:

```solidity
creditorAddresses = new address ;
creditorAmounts = new uint ;
```

These lines reset the arrays `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` to empty arrays. If there are a large number of creditors, resetting these arrays can consume a significant amount of gas, which could potentially exceed the gas limit and cause the function to fail. This could prevent further execution of the contract, leading to a **denial of service** attack.",denial of service,3.0,553.0,6.0,3.2008056640625
136,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability in the `Refunder` contract lies in the use of `require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));` in the `refundAll` function. The `send` function only forwards 2300 gas, which may not be enough if the recipient address contains complex code in its fallback function. If the `send` fails for any address in the loop, the entire refund process will stop, leading to a denial of service (DoS) for the other addresses waiting to receive their refunds.",denial of service,3.0,544.0,6.0,3.9361162185668945
137,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability in this contract stems from the `ifillArray` function in the `DosOneFunc` contract. The loop at line 17 (`for(uint i=0;i<350;i++)`) repeatedly adds the sender's address to the `listAddresses` array, which could potentially consume too much gas. If the gas limit is exceeded during the execution of this function, it can lead to a denial of service, preventing further calls to this function or other parts of the contract from being executed. Therefore, it is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to excessive gas consumption.",denial of service,3.0,554.0,6.0,4.881065368652344
