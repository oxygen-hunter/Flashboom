11,access control,YES. The vulnerability lies in the **newOwner** function of the **MultiOwnable** contract. Any user can call the **newOwner** function to assign themselves or another address as an owner because there is no access control to restrict who can call this function. This allows an attacker to gain ownership of the contract by calling **newOwner** with their own address.,access control,3.0,508.0,6.0,3.0279347896575928
12,access control,"YES. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient access control in the `missing()` function. The `missing()` function allows any user to become the contract owner by calling it, as there are no restrictions on who can execute it. This can lead to unauthorized users taking control of the contract and, combined with the `withdraw()` function, they could drain the contract's funds.

Additionally, the `LetsSuicide` contract uses `suicide()` to send funds to any specified address, which can be exploited to forcefully transfer Ether to the `Missing` contract, bypassing usual access checks.",access control,4.0,551.0,6.0,2.837291955947876

The vulnerability is present due to the improper access control in the `DynamicPyramid` function. This function is intended to be a constructor, but since Solidity version 0.4.15 does not use the constructor keyword, this allows anyone to call the `DynamicPyramid` function again after the contract is deployed. As a result, any user can become the `creator` and gain unauthorized access to functions that are restricted to the contract owner, such as `collectAllFees`, `collectFeesInEther`, and `changeOwner`.",access control,3.0,544.0,6.0,3.2873120307922363

The vulnerability arises from improper access control in the `withdraw` function of the `Wallet` contract. Specifically, in the following line:

```solidity

```

The condition should be checking whether `amount <= balances[msg.sender]` instead of `amount >= balances[msg.sender]`. This incorrect condition allows users to withdraw funds even when they do not have a sufficient balance, leading to potential loss of funds.

The vulnerability lies in the lack of access control for the `set` function in the `Map` contract. Any external user can call the `set` function to modify the `map` array, which can lead to unauthorized changes to the contract's internal state. Additionally, in the `SuicideContract`, the `NukeContract` function creates a `LetsSuicide` contract that can forcefully send Ether to any specified address (`Russian`), potentially causing unintended consequences such as draining the contract's balance.",access control,4.0,538.0,6.0,3.208982467651367

This can allow an attacker to exploit the contract by passing in malicious logic, which will execute in the context of the `Proxy` contract, potentially leading to unauthorized control over contract state or funds.

In addition, the `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract` contracts present vulnerabilities as they allow the transfer of control over contract destruction using `suicide` (now `selfdestruct`), which can result in the loss of funds or other unintended consequences. The combination of `delegatecall` and `selfdestruct` mechanisms increases the risk of severe damage to the contract.",access control,4.0,578.0,6.0,2.3112499713897705
18,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability lies in the **lack of proper access control** for critical functions in the `Wallet` contract. Specifically:

1. **PushBonusCode** and **PopBonusCode** are public functions, allowing anyone to modify the `bonusCodes` array without any restriction, which could compromise the intended functionality.
  
2. The **PopBonusCode** function has an ineffective check: `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length);`. Since the length of an array is always non-negative, this condition is always true, making it meaningless. Furthermore, reducing the length of the array manually (`bonusCodes.length--`) is unsafe as it can cause unexpected behavior or loss of data if not properly managed.

3. The **Destroy** function is also vulnerable, as it allows the owner to self-destruct the contract, which could result in a denial of service if misused.",access control,4.0,616.0,6.0,3.0261592864990234
19,access control,"YES, the vulnerability exists.

The vulnerability in the contract lies in the `Constructor` function. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, a function with the same name as the contract is treated as a constructor. However, in the provided code, the function is named `Constructor` with a capital ""C"", which does **not** match the contract name `Missing`. As a result, it is treated as a regular function, not a constructor.

This means the `owner` variable is never initialized to the contract deployer's address, leaving the contract vulnerable to anyone calling the `Constructor` function and setting themselves as the owner. Consequently, an attacker could take control of the contract and withdraw its balance using the `withdraw` function.

Additionally, the `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract` contracts involve the `suicide` function, which could be used to forcefully send Ether to the `Missing` contract, but this is secondary to the primary access control issue in the `Missing` contract.",access control,4.0,640.0,6.0,2.5666592121124268
20,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `initWallet()` function, which assigns the `creator` address, is publicly accessible. This means any user can call this function and assign themselves as the creator, thereby gaining control over the `migrateTo()` function, which allows transferring all the contract's balance to an arbitrary address.

The vulnerability arises from the use of `tx.origin` for access control in the `sendTo` function. The `require(tx.origin == owner)` line can be exploited by an attacker who creates a malicious contract (like `SuicideContract`). By tricking the owner into interacting with the malicious contract, the attacker's contract can initiate a transaction where `tx.origin` still refers to the owner, thus bypassing the access control check. This allows unauthorized transfers of funds.

The `suicide` function in `LetsSuicide` further aggravates the issue by forcibly sending Ether to any address without its consent, making it easier for attackers to manipulate funds.",access control,4.0,573.0,6.0,2.5667223930358887

The vulnerability arises from the `refund()` function in the `Wallet` contract. This function allows anyone to withdraw all of their balance without any restrictions or proper access control. There is no verification of the user’s relationship to the balance (e.g., requiring ownership or permissions). This creates a risk where any user with a balance in the contract can drain their entire funds without sufficient checks, potentially bypassing intended limitations on withdrawal behavior. Additionally, the ""migrateTo"" function relies solely on the creator, which can also lead to vulnerabilities if the creator's account is compromised.",access control,4.0,556.0,6.0,2.5566389560699463
23,access control,"YES

The vulnerability arises due to a lack of proper access control in both the `SimpleSuicide` and `LetsSuicide` contracts. Specifically:

- In `SimpleSuicide`, the function `sudicideAnyone()` allows **anyone** to trigger `selfdestruct(msg.sender)`, transferring all contract funds to the caller without restriction.
  
- In `LetsSuicide`, the constructor immediately calls `suicide(LetsFuckingSuicide)` upon deployment, sending the contract's balance to the provided address. This could be abused if the constructor is called by an unauthorized user.

The vulnerability lies in the `changeOwner` function, which lacks any access control modifiers such as `onlyowner`. This allows anyone to call the function and change the owner of the contract, which is an access control issue. Additionally, the `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract` contracts present further vulnerabilities, as they allow the use of the `suicide` (now `selfdestruct` in newer versions) function, which transfers all contract funds to the specified address without proper checks or restrictions.

25,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `tx.origin` for access control. Specifically, in the `Phishable` contract's `withdrawAll` function, it checks if `tx.origin == owner`. This method of validating the caller is insecure because `tx.origin` refers to the original external account that initiated the transaction, even across multiple contract calls. 

In this case, an attacker can create another contract (such as `SuicideContract` and `LetsSuicide`) that initiates the call to `Phishable` on behalf of the victim. Since `tx.origin` would still be the victim’s address, the `require(tx.origin == owner)` check would pass, allowing the attacker to withdraw the funds.",access control,3.0,585.0,6.0,3.1109092235565186
26,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the use of `delegatecall` on the untrusted `fibonacciLibrary` contract in lines 31 and 38. This allows an attacker to control the execution context of the `FibonacciBalance` contract, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of the contract's state. Additionally, `delegatecall` can be exploited if the library contains malicious or unsafe code, as it executes in the context of the calling contract, exposing internal storage and balance.",access control,4.0,535.0,6.0,3.2012453079223633

The vulnerability exists in the use of the low-level `call` function in the `Command` function of the `Pie` contract. As described earlier, low-level functions like `call` do not throw an error if they fail; instead, they return a boolean value that must be checked to determine success or failure. In this contract, the return value of `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)` is not checked, which introduces a risk of failed calls not being detected, potentially leading to unwanted behavior.

Additionally, the `LetsSuicide` contract uses the `suicide` (now `selfdestruct`) function, which forcefully transfers the contract's balance to an address, potentially draining funds from the `Pie` contract if this mechanism is exploited.

Hence, the contract is vulnerable.",unchecked low level calls,4.0,597.0,6.0,3.1728079319000244
28,unchecked low level calls,"YES

It is vulnerable because the code uses low-level calls like `send()` in lines 54 and 65 without checking the return values. These calls may fail, and since the return values are not checked, it can lead to loss of funds or unexpected contract behavior. Specifically, `owner2.send(sum2)` and `owner.send(balance)` do not handle potential failures, which is a common vulnerability in Solidity.",unchecked low level calls,3.0,519.0,6.0,1.9885056018829346

The vulnerability in the given smart contract lies in the usage of the low-level `call` function in the `Command` function (line 39). The return value of `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)` is not checked, which is risky because if the call fails, it will not revert the transaction, leading to potential security risks, such as unwanted outcomes or loss of funds.

Additionally, the `LetsSuicide` contract uses the `suicide` function (now known as `selfdestruct` in modern Solidity), which can forcefully send Ether to any address, including potentially vulnerable contracts like `Freebie`. This can drain or disrupt the `Freebie` contract, exposing it to further vulnerabilities related to uncontrolled contract interactions.",unchecked low level calls,4.0,586.0,6.0,2.6744699478149414

The contract is vulnerable because it uses the `send` function in several places (lines 110, 118, 132, and 174) without checking the return value. The `send` function can fail, and when it does, the contract continues execution without reverting the state, which can lead to inconsistencies or unintended outcomes.

Moreover, the `LetsSuicide` contract uses the `suicide` function (or `selfdestruct` in modern Solidity versions), which can forcefully send Ether to the target address, bypassing the control of the `KingOfTheEtherThrone` contract. This makes the contract susceptible to attacks that manipulate the state and Ether balance.",unchecked low level calls,4.0,582.0,6.0,1.4290359020233154

The vulnerability lies in the use of low-level `call()` in the `airPort` contract (line 17) without checking its return value. Low-level `call()` returns a boolean value indicating success or failure, and failing to check this return value can allow the function to continue execution even if the call fails. This could result in unexpected behavior or security issues, such as failing to transfer tokens properly, leading to a potential loss of funds or incomplete transactions.

The second part involving the `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract` contracts also introduces potential security issues with self-destruction via the `suicide()` function.

The vulnerability in the second contract lies in its usage of low-level `send` calls without checking return values, as well as the potential issues arising from the `LetsSuicide` contract. Specifically:

1. **Unchecked `send` Calls**: The `send` function, used in lines such as `winner.send(subpot)` and `msg.sender.send(msg.value - value)`, does not check whether the transfer was successful. This can lead to funds not being transferred as expected, creating a vulnerability for failed transfers.
  
2. **LetsSuicide Contract**: The `LetsSuicide` contract uses the `suicide` (now known as `selfdestruct`) function to forcefully send funds to an address. This can potentially disrupt the state of contracts like Lotto if they are not prepared to handle arbitrary incoming funds.

As mentioned before, low-level calls in Solidity, such as `call()`, do not propagate errors and return a boolean value. If the return value is not checked, it can lead to vulnerabilities, such as failing to detect whether the call was successful or not. In this case, if `callee.call()` fails, the transaction continues, which can result in unintended outcomes, such as loss of funds.

   The line `_dst.call.value(_value)(_data);` does not check the return value of the low-level `call`, which is prone to failure without reverting the execution. If the call fails, the transaction will continue without halting or throwing an error, potentially leading to unexpected or insecure behavior.

2. **Usage of `suicide` (aka `selfdestruct`)**:
   The `LetsSuicide` contract uses the `suicide` function, sending the contract's funds to the specified address (`LetsFuckingSuicide`) without performing any checks. The `suicide` function can be used maliciously to transfer contract balance, destroy the contract, and manipulate the state.

Additionally, the use of `suicide()` in the `LetsSuicide` contract and `NukeContract` also raises concerns, as it forcefully transfers the contract's balance to the specified address, potentially leading to loss of funds or unexpected contract termination.",unchecked low level calls,4.0,545.0,6.0,2.776916027069092
54,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of the low-level `call()` function without checking the return value in the `transfer()` function. Specifically, the call to `caddress.call(id, from, _tos[i], v);` could fail, and since the return value is not checked, the function will continue execution, leading to potential fail-open scenarios where funds or operations might not behave as intended.

In addition, the `suicide()` function used in the `LetsSuicide` contract can also pose security risks. It allows the transfer of the entire contract's balance to an arbitrary address, which can be dangerous if misused or exploited in the context of the overall system.",unchecked low level calls,4.0,578.0,6.0,2.464202642440796

The vulnerability in the provided smart contract lies in the use of low-level calls, particularly in the `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)` in the `Command` function. The return value of this low-level call is unchecked, which can lead to potential fail-open scenarios. If the call fails, the contract will not revert, and the execution will continue, which may leave the contract in an unintended state. 

Additionally, the `suicide` function in the `LetsSuicide` contract sends all the contract's balance to the specified address. This could also be exploited to transfer funds maliciously, making the whole contract system more vulnerable.",unchecked low level calls,4.0,566.0,6.0,1.9380667209625244
56,unchecked low level calls,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the unchecked low-level call in the `makeOldFucks` function, specifically:

```solidity

Since the return value of the `call()` function is not checked, if the call fails (e.g., the target function does not exist, or there is an error during execution), the execution will not revert, and the contract will proceed as if the call succeeded. This can lead to unintended behaviors, such as failing silently and not providing the intended rewards, which is a significant vulnerability.

Additionally, the `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract` can introduce vulnerabilities related to forced ether transfers and contract destruction via the `suicide()` function. These can result in ether being sent to unintended addresses without their consent or proper checks.",unchecked low level calls,4.0,605.0,6.0,2.8306872844696045

This can lead to scenarios where the low-level call fails but the execution continues without reverting, which could result in unintended behavior or loss of funds.

2. **`suicide` in `LetsSuicide`**: The `LetsSuicide` contract calls `suicide(LetsFuckingSuicide);`, which transfers all the contract's Ether to the specified address and destroys the contract. This could be used maliciously to send funds to any arbitrary address without proper control, leading to potential vulnerabilities in handling funds.

The vulnerability in the provided code lies in the unchecked low-level `call()` function in the `airdrop` contract, specifically at this line:

```solidity
caddress.call(id, from, _tos[i], v);

This low-level call does not check the return value, meaning that even if the `call()` fails, the contract will continue to execute. This can lead to vulnerabilities such as fund loss, as the function does not handle potential errors from the external contract's execution.

Additionally, the `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract` contracts introduce further risks. These contracts can forcefully transfer ether or destroy contracts, which, combined with the unchecked `call()`, can lead to serious exploitation scenarios like draining the contract's funds or breaking contract logic.",unchecked low level calls,4.0,595.0,6.0,2.7725377082824707

The vulnerability is present in the **use of low-level calls and unchecked return values**. In particular:

1. In the `Caller` contract, the line `a.call();` uses the low-level function `call()`, which, as mentioned, does not propagate errors and returns a boolean value indicating success or failure. This return value is not checked, so any failure in the external contract execution would not be detected, potentially leading to unintended outcomes.
  
2. The `suicide()` function used in the `LetsSuicide` contract can forcefully transfer the contract's balance to the specified address (`LetsFuckingSuicide`). It is combined with the unchecked low-level call in the `SuicideContract`. If `Russian` is a contract that fails, the low-level call won't revert the transaction, and any error will be ignored.

The vulnerability lies in the use of low-level calls, specifically in `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)` within the `Command` function. Low-level calls like `call()` do not throw exceptions on failure but return a boolean value, which is not checked in the provided code. If the call fails, the contract will continue execution without handling the failure, which can lead to unwanted behavior such as the loss of funds or other unintended consequences.

Additionally, the `suicide()` function in the `LetsSuicide` contract allows an external contract to forcibly transfer its balance to another contract, which can be exploited if proper checks and balances are not implemented.

   This check does not prevent underflows because subtraction (`balances[msg.sender] - _value`) is performed first. If `_value` is greater than `balances[msg.sender]`, this will underflow and bypass the intended check.

2. Similarly, the line:

If a large enough `input` is provided, the value of `count` can overflow, leading to incorrect or malicious behavior.

Additionally, in the `SuicideContract`, the function `NukeContract` can forcefully destroy a contract by invoking the `suicide` function from `LetsSuicide`, allowing funds to be transferred to any arbitrary address, which could be dangerous if misused.",arithmetic,4.0,575.0,6.0,10.532123804092407

The vulnerability is due to the potential for integer overflow in the `Overflow` contract at the line `sellerBalance += value;`. Since Solidity version 0.4.15 does not include automatic overflow/underflow protection, adding large values to `sellerBalance` could cause an overflow. This means the `sellerBalance` could wrap around to a much smaller number than expected, allowing unintended behavior.

Additionally, in the `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract`, the `suicide` function (now deprecated and replaced by `selfdestruct`) is used, which can be risky because it allows a contract to forcefully send all its Ether balance to any address.

The vulnerability still lies in the same area as in the first contract, specifically the line `balanceOf[_to] += _value;`. Since this code uses Solidity version `^0.4.10`, it lacks built-in protection against arithmetic overflows and underflows. If the `_value` added to `balanceOf[_to]` exceeds the maximum value that a `uint256` can hold, it will wrap around and cause an overflow, leading to potential loss of funds or misallocation of balances.

The given smart contract is vulnerable for the following reasons:

1. **Insecure Randomness**: The original vulnerability involving randomness is still present. The use of `block.number % 2` in the `makeBet()` function as a way to determine the outcome (`won` variable) is insecure. The block number can be influenced by miners, making this randomness predictable and allowing for possible exploitation by users who can control the outcome of bets.

2. **Selfdestruct Vulnerability**: The `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract` introduce another vulnerability. These contracts make it possible for an external actor to forcefully send Ether to the `Lottery` contract using the `suicide` (now known as `selfdestruct`) function.

96,bad randomness,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable due to the following reasons:

1. **Predictable Randomness (Lines 12, 18, 20, 22)**:
   - The contract uses `block.timestamp` (line 12) as the initial salt for randomness, which is predictable and can be influenced by miners.
   - The calculation of `y` (line 18) involves `block.number` and a modulus operation on the salt, making it further predictable.
   - The `seed` (line 20) is calculated using `block.number` and the predictable value of `salt % 300` along with `y`.
   - The use of `blockhash(seed)` (line 22) is flawed because `blockhash` can only access hashes of the most recent 256 blocks, making it predictable.

2. **Suicide Attack (Lines 28, 33)**:
   - The `LetsSuicide` contract (line 28) can be used to self-destruct and send all its Ether balance to a specified address upon deployment.

The first vulnerability is the reliance on `block.timestamp` for randomness generation (line 27). As explained, the miner can manipulate `block.timestamp`, which makes the randomness predictable and exploitable, especially in scenarios like lotteries.

The second vulnerability is related to the `LetsSuicide` contract. It calls `suicide(LetsFuckingSuicide);`, which will forcibly send the entire contract balance to the provided address, potentially draining funds from the `lottopollo` contract. This makes the system prone to destructive attacks, where an attacker could terminate the contract and send its balance to any arbitrary address.

129,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the reliance on `block.timestamp` for determining when the investment reset occurs. As mentioned, `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners to some extent, allowing them to adjust the timing slightly to their advantage. This can lead to time manipulation exploits, where a miner or an attacker can manipulate the time window for resetting the investment and collecting the jackpot.

The vulnerability lies in the same time manipulation issue in the `Roulette` contract, where the `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) is used in line 18 (`require(now != pastBlockTime);`) and line 20 (`pastBlockTime = now;`). As miners can manipulate the `block.timestamp`, they could exploit this to execute the function at a specific time when the `if(now % 15 == 0)` condition is met, allowing them to drain the contract's balance.

Additionally, the `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract` introduce another vulnerability by using the `suicide` function. This can send all the contract's balance to an address (in this case, `Russian`), which further compromises the contract’s security by allowing funds to be redirected forcefully.",time manipulation,4.0,605.0,6.0,2.622088670730591

As explained, miners can manipulate the block timestamp within a certain range. This allows them to influence the outcome of the random number generation. Since the random number directly determines whether the player wins the pot, a malicious miner can take advantage of this and manipulate the timestamp to increase their chances of winning.

Furthermore, the `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract` contracts introduce another vulnerability: the `suicide` function, which forcefully sends Ether to any address, could be used to disrupt contract behavior.

The contract is vulnerable due to the combination of the `emptyCreditors` function in the `DosGas` contract and the behavior of the `LetsSuicide` contract. The vulnerability arises because the `LetsSuicide` contract uses the `suicide` (now known as `selfdestruct`) function, which forcibly transfers Ether to the specified address (`LetsFuckingSuicide`). If this happens while the `DosGas` contract is running or processing a transaction, it could disrupt normal operations by consuming gas unexpectedly or preventing certain functions from executing, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) scenario.",denial of service,4.0,560.0,6.0,2.769061326980591
134,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability is due to the potential for **denial of service** (DoS) attacks. Specifically:

1. **Array resizing in `insertNnumbers`**: In the `insertNnumbers` function, the dynamic resizing of the `array` on line 20 (`array.length += 1;`) can be exploited to consume excessive gas. If a very large number of elements are inserted, the cost of repeatedly resizing the array can increase significantly, potentially causing the contract to run out of gas, leading to a DoS situation where further transactions cannot be processed.

2. **DoS with `suicide` in `LetsSuicide` contract**: The `suicide` (now `selfdestruct` in newer Solidity versions) in the `LetsSuicide` contract can be used to maliciously send funds to the target contract, disrupting its normal operation by forcing it to handle Ether it may not expect, or potentially blocking future transactions if it does not have the proper fallback functions to handle the Ether. This can lead to another form of denial of service attack.

136,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable because the `refundAll` function uses `send` to transfer funds, and a failure in any single transfer due to conditions like low gas or malicious behavior from one of the recipients will cause the entire loop to revert, thus blocking all refunds. Additionally, the introduction of the `LetsSuicide` contract allows for a denial of service attack by transferring Ether to the `Refunder` contract in a way that could further disrupt the contract’s functionality.",denial of service,4.0,529.0,6.0,2.5643203258514404
137,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the potential for a denial-of-service (DoS) attack caused by the excessive use of gas in the `ifillArray` function. Specifically, the loop on line 17 (`for(uint i=0;i<350;i++)`) pushes the `msg.sender` to the `listAddresses` array 350 times. As the array grows, the gas cost to execute this operation increases, potentially causing the transaction to fail once the gas limit is exceeded.

Additionally, the `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract` contracts introduce a security risk through the use of the `suicide` function (now called `selfdestruct` in modern Solidity versions). This can result in the forced transfer of ether to a vulnerable contract, potentially rendering it unusable due to malicious behavior. This further contributes to the DoS vulnerability.",denial of service,4.0,607.0,6.0,3.8794734477996826
138,denial of service,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability occurs due to the use of `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` in the `DosAuction` contract. This sends funds to the `currentFrontrunner` using the `send` method, which forwards only a limited amount of gas. If the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract, such as the `LetsSuicide` or another contract with fallback functions that consume excessive gas or revert the transaction, it can block the auction by preventing the send operation from succeeding. This will cause the `require` statement to fail, denying further bids and locking the auction in a denial of service state.",denial of service,3.0,571.0,6.0,4.257474184036255
