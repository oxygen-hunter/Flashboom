This use of `call()` does not check the return value, which could lead to a situation where the function silently fails, and the contract continues execution without detecting the failure. This is a well-known security risk, as low-level calls do not automatically revert when they fail, unlike standard Solidity function calls.

The vulnerability exists in the **`msg.sender.call.value(balances[msg.sender])()`** line in the `withdraw()` function of the `keepMyEther` contract. The use of the low-level `call` function does not check for the success of the call, which could lead to a situation where the transfer fails, but the contract continues to execute and sets the balance of the sender to zero regardless. This could result in a loss of funds, as the balance is cleared even though the transfer might not have occurred.

Additionally, low-level calls are dangerous as they allow for reentrancy attacks, where an attacker can repeatedly call the `withdraw()` function before the balance is updated, potentially draining the contract's funds.",unchecked low level calls,4.0,583.0,6.0,4.4390435218811035

120,reentrancy,"YES. The contract is vulnerable due to the use of the low-level `call` function in the `CashOut` function (line 38), which is susceptible to a reentrancy attack. This allows an external contract to recursively call back into the `CashOut` function before the balance is updated, potentially draining funds from the contract.",reentrancy,3.0,503.0,6.0,3.1816341876983643
121,reentrancy,"YES, it is vulnerable because the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` function in the `Collect` method allows for reentrancy attacks. This low-level call does not prevent the external contract from calling back into the `Collect` function before the execution is complete, potentially allowing an attacker to drain the contract's balance by repeatedly calling the function.",reentrancy,3.0,505.0,6.0,3.476330518722534
122,reentrancy,"YES, the contract is vulnerable due to the potential for a **reentrancy attack**. The vulnerability occurs in the `CashOut` function, where the line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())` sends Ether to the caller using a low-level `call`. This opens up the contract to a reentrancy attack because the external contract (or malicious attacker) can call back into the `CashOut` function before the `balances[msg.sender]` is reduced. This allows the attacker to drain funds by repeatedly calling `CashOut` before the balance is updated.",reentrancy,3.0,551.0,6.0,3.254624843597412
123,reentrancy,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function, specifically in the line: 

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This allows for a **reentrancy attack**, where an attacker could call the `Collect` function recursively before the `acc.balance -= _am;` line is executed, thus repeatedly withdrawing funds. The contract does not update the state before the external call, which exposes it to this attack.",reentrancy,3.0,526.0,6.0,2.9606542587280273
124,reentrancy,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `CashOut` function where the line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())` allows an external call using a low-level `call`. This can result in a reentrancy attack, as an attacker can repeatedly call the `CashOut` function before the balance is updated. This can drain the contract's funds by exploiting the reentrancy vulnerability.",reentrancy,3.0,518.0,6.0,3.6870996952056885

127,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` in the `isSaleFinished` function of the `TimedCrowdsale` contract. As explained, miners have the ability to manipulate `block.timestamp`, which can affect the contract's logic, particularly when determining the end of a sale.",time manipulation,3.0,501.0,6.0,2.5565505027770996
128,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` in line 27 (`return block.timestamp;`). This introduces the risk of time manipulation because miners can influence the block timestamp. Additionally, the contract uses this timestamp to generate randomness, which is a bad practice since block timestamps are not truly random and can be manipulated to exploit the lottery process. Moreover, in line 13 (`if (rand > 0 && now - rand > 24 hours)`), the reliance on `now` (an alias for `block.timestamp`) further exposes the contract to time manipulation, as miners have some control over when blocks are mined.",time manipulation,4.0,564.0,6.0,2.4451918601989746
129,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability arises from the use of `block.timestamp` in the `Governmental` contract, particularly in the `lastInvestmentTimestamp = block.timestamp` line. Since miners can manipulate the timestamp within a small range, this can lead to exploits, especially when time-based logic is critical, as seen with the time-dependent condition in the `resetInvestment` function. This makes the contract vulnerable to time manipulation.",time manipulation,3.0,516.0,6.0,2.114490509033203
130,time manipulation,"YES, the contract is vulnerable because the `Roulette` contract still relies on `now` (or `block.timestamp`) for critical functionality. As previously explained, `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners, allowing them to influence the outcome, especially in the conditional statement `if(now % 15 == 0)` that determines whether the contract balance is transferred to the sender.",time manipulation,3.0,510.0,6.0,3.1603498458862305
131,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is due to the use of `block.timestamp` for randomness in the line:

```solidity
var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;
```

This introduces the possibility of miner manipulation, as miners can influence `block.timestamp` to control the outcome of the random number generation. This reliance on time for randomness can be exploited, leading to unfair outcomes in the contract.",time manipulation,3.0,521.0,6.0,4.190343379974365
132,short addresses,"YES, it is vulnerable. The `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract is susceptible to short address attacks. This is because it relies on external calls to the `transfer` function of an ERC20 token without verifying the length of input data. If a client creates a transaction with a malformed address, the EVM might interpret the arguments incorrectly, potentially causing funds to be sent to the wrong address or allowing attackers to extract more tokens than intended.",short addresses,3.0,529.0,6.0,4.491074562072754
133,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. It involves a potential **denial of service (DoS)** attack caused by an unbounded loop that iterates over the `dests` array. If the array of destinations is too large, the gas cost of executing the function could exceed the block gas limit, preventing the function from completing and potentially locking the contract in a state where it can't execute further operations.",denial of service,3.0,531.0,6.0,2.6430070400238037
134,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability stems from the `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract, specifically in the `while` loop. This loop iterates over the entire `dests` array and calls the `transfer` function for each address. If the `dests` array is large, the gas required to execute the function increases significantly. This could lead to a situation where the gas limit is exceeded, resulting in the function being unable to complete its execution. This type of issue is known as a ""Denial of Service (DoS)"" vulnerability due to excessive gas consumption, effectively preventing the function from working as intended for large inputs.",denial of service,3.0,575.0,6.0,2.9239187240600586
135,denial of service,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to the potential for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. Specifically, the `while` loop iterates over the `dests` array, sending tokens to each address. If one of the recipients is a contract that rejects tokens or runs out of gas, the entire transaction will fail, preventing any further recipients from receiving their tokens. This can result in a DoS, as a single faulty recipient can block the entire batch of transfers.",denial of service,3.0,550.0,6.0,2.2190492153167725
136,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll()` function of the `Refunder` contract. The use of `require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));` can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack. If one of the addresses in `refundAddresses` fails the `send()` function, the entire loop will revert, preventing the refund process for all addresses. A malicious or unintended failure from one address can thus block refunds for everyone, making the contract vulnerable to DoS.",denial of service,3.0,547.0,6.0,4.710132360458374
137,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract. It uses a `while` loop to iterate over the `dests` array, which could potentially cause the contract to run out of gas if the array is too large, leading to a **Denial of Service** (DoS) vulnerability due to gas exhaustion. This can prevent the function from completing and halt the contract.",denial of service,3.0,523.0,6.0,2.884316921234131
138,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because the `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` line introduces a Denial of Service (DoS) risk. If the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that has a fallback function that consumes a lot of gas or reverts the transaction, the `send` function will fail, preventing other bidders from placing bids and effectively halting the auction.",denial of service,3.0,518.0,6.0,3.3253302574157715
