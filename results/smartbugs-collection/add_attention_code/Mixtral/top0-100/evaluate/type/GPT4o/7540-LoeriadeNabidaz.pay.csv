This low-level call does not check for the return value, meaning that if the call fails (for example, if the recipient's address is a contract that does not accept Ether or has a fallback function with high gas requirements), the Ether transfer will fail, but the contract will proceed to set the sender's balance to 0, effectively losing funds. This vulnerability could lead to loss of funds and other undesirable outcomes.",unchecked low level calls,3.0,550.0,6.0,2.631265163421631
69,unchecked low level calls,"YES. The contract is vulnerable due to the same issue mentioned earlier: the unchecked use of low-level calls in the `Command` function, specifically `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)`. Low-level calls like `call()` do not automatically handle errors, and because the return value of `adr.call()` is not checked, this could lead to a failure that goes unnoticed. This introduces the risk of fail-open scenarios, where the contract continues execution even if the call fails. Additionally, if the external contract or address behaves unexpectedly, it could compromise the security of the smart contract.",unchecked low level calls,4.0,552.0,6.0,3.6522133350372314

73,front running,"YES

The contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks in the following parts:

1. In the `pay()` function, once the counter `c` reaches 2, the contract's entire balance is transferred to the sender. Since the transaction order on the Ethereum blockchain can be manipulated by miners or other users offering higher gas fees, someone observing a transaction where `c` is about to reach 2 could front-run it by submitting their own transaction with a higher gas fee. This would allow the attacker to claim the balance before the original user.

2. Similar vulnerabilities exist in the `setReward()` and `claimReward()` functions, as found in the previous example. The use of `msg.sender.transfer(reward)` in these functions can also be front-run by a malicious actor who offers a higher gas fee to claim the reward ahead of the legitimate user.",front running,3.0,605.0,6.0,5.19753885269165
74,front running,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to a front-running attack. Specifically, the vulnerability is in the `solve` function, where the line `require(hash == sha3(solution));` exposes the solution to front-running. A malicious user can monitor the pending transactions on the blockchain, extract the solution from another user's transaction, and submit their own transaction with a higher gas fee to claim the reward of 1000 ether, preempting the original user.",front running,3.0,524.0,6.0,3.234914779663086
75,front running,"YES

The contract is vulnerable to front-running in the `pay()` function. Since the condition `c == 2` triggers a reward transfer (`msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);`), a malicious actor could observe when the counter `c` reaches 1 and then quickly submit a transaction with a higher gas fee to trigger the second `pay()` call. This would allow the attacker to claim the entire contract balance before the legitimate user completes their second transaction.",front running,3.0,525.0,6.0,3.9328701496124268
76,front running,"YES

The second contract is still vulnerable to front-running attacks. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the **play** function, as in the first contract. When a player submits their move by calling the `play` function with a number, another player can observe this transaction in the mempool and submit their own transaction with higher gas fees to front-run the original player. They could potentially exploit this information to influence the outcome in their favor.

77,arithmetic,"YES

The vulnerability lies in line 22: `map[k] -= v;`. This line can cause an integer underflow if `v` is larger than `map[k]`, which could lead to unintended behavior since Solidity versions before 0.8.0 do not automatically check for arithmetic overflows or underflows.

Additionally, while not related to arithmetic underflow, the `pay()` function is also vulnerable to reentrancy attacks due to the `msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);` call before resetting `c = 0;`. This could allow an attacker to recursively call `pay()` and drain the contract balance.",arithmetic,4.0,559.0,6.0,2.7465646266937256

If a large enough `input` value is provided, the multiplication could overflow, resulting in an incorrect or unintended value for `count`.

Additionally, the `pay` function introduces another vulnerability related to reentrancy. When the contract sends Ether to `msg.sender` using `msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);`, there is a risk of reentrancy if the `msg.sender` is a contract that could recursively call the `pay` function and manipulate the contract’s balance or state (specifically the `c` variable).",arithmetic,4.0,596.0,6.0,4.592255353927612

The vulnerability exists in both the `pay` and `run` functions. Specifically, in the `run` function, the line `count -= input;` still presents the risk of an arithmetic underflow. If the `input` value is larger than the current `count`, it will result in an underflow, potentially causing an unintended large value for `count`. Additionally, the `pay` function may also have issues with unchecked arithmetic (`c = c + 1;`), though the primary vulnerability stems from the underflow in the `run` function.",arithmetic,3.0,552.0,6.0,3.633599042892456

88,arithmetic,"YES

The vulnerability in this contract is still related to arithmetic overflow. Specifically, in the `run` function, adding an unchecked `input` to `count` could result in an overflow if `input` is large enough. Since the Solidity version is `^0.4.19`, this version does not include automatic overflow/underflow checks, making it vulnerable to integer overflow attacks, similar to the original example.

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This call to `msg.sender.call.value()` allows an external contract (or attacker) to recursively call the `CashOut` function before the previous execution is completed. This is the essence of a reentrancy attack, as the state (`balances[msg.sender]`) is updated **after** the external call, making the contract vulnerable to being drained of funds.",reentrancy,3.0,538.0,6.0,3.689960241317749

126,reentrancy,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function, which still allows reentrancy attacks because the external call to `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""");` is made before updating the user's balance. An attacker can reenter the contract during this call and repeatedly drain the funds before the balance is set to zero.",reentrancy,3.0,505.0,6.0,3.21478271484375
127,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `isSaleFinished()` function, which still relies on `block.timestamp` for determining whether the sale is finished. As previously explained, miners can manipulate `block.timestamp`, which makes the contract susceptible to time manipulation attacks.",time manipulation,3.0,488.0,6.0,3.9935693740844727
128,time manipulation,"YES, the contract is vulnerable because it relies on `block.timestamp` in the `randomGen()` function, which allows miners to manipulate the value. Additionally, in the `payOut()` function, the conditional check `if (rand > 0 && now - rand > 24 hours)` on line 19 is also problematic, as `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) can be manipulated by miners, making it vulnerable to timestamp manipulation attacks.",time manipulation,3.0,525.0,6.0,2.7366199493408203
129,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` (or `now`) in the `resetInvestment` function. This allows the miner to manipulate the block timestamp slightly, which could enable timing manipulation attacks, making it possible for the attacker to call the `resetInvestment` function at an advantageous moment. This type of vulnerability is known as **timestamp dependence**, and it can compromise the security of time-dependent contracts.",time manipulation,3.0,518.0,6.0,2.4669041633605957
130,time manipulation,"YES

The vulnerability still exists in the updated contract. Specifically, the code continues to rely on `now` (an alias for `block.timestamp`), which is susceptible to manipulation by miners. The vulnerability lies in the line:

```solidity
require(now != pastBlockTime); 
```

and

```solidity
pastBlockTime = now;
```

The miner can manipulate the timestamp to control when the `now % 15 == 0` condition becomes true, which could allow them to unfairly win the balance of the contract. Therefore, the contract is vulnerable to time manipulation.",time manipulation,3.0,554.0,6.0,1.8872921466827393
131,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is due to the use of `block.timestamp` for randomness generation on line 48: `var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;`. This allows miners to manipulate the block timestamp, influencing the random outcome and potentially exploiting the contract. The contract relies on this randomness to determine the winner, making it susceptible to manipulation.",time manipulation,3.0,513.0,6.0,2.670642614364624
132,short addresses,"YES. It is vulnerable due to the possibility of a reentrancy attack in the `pay` function. When `msg.sender.transfer(this.balance)` is called, it transfers ether back to the sender, which can trigger fallback functions and allow reentrance before the state variable `c` is reset. This could lead to unintended behavior and manipulation of the contract's state, allowing attackers to drain the contract's funds.",short addresses,2.0,517.0,6.0,3.0293712615966797
133,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the use of the `msg.sender.transfer()` function in the `pay()` function. This can cause a denial of service if `msg.sender` is a contract with a fallback function that consumes too much gas or fails. If the transfer of funds fails due to insufficient gas or any malicious behavior of the recipient contract, it could block the execution of future payments, effectively causing a denial of service.",denial of service,3.0,519.0,6.0,5.192030429840088
134,denial of service,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability lies in the potential for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack in the `insertNnumbers` function. Specifically, the loop dynamically increases the array size during each iteration (`array.length += 1`), which can consume excessive gas, especially if a large number of elements are inserted. This can cause the transaction to fail due to running out of gas, effectively making the contract unusable. The dynamic resizing of the array in combination with a large number of iterations contributes to the vulnerability.",denial of service,3.0,544.0,6.0,4.752221584320068
135,denial of service,"YES

The contract is vulnerable due to a potential denial of service (DoS) issue. Specifically, in the `lendGovernmentMoney` function, the use of `creditorAddresses = new address ;` and `creditorAmounts = new uint ;` (lines 46 and 48) could lead to loss of creditor data, and if the contract runs out of gas or funds during these operations, it could prevent further function execution. Moreover, improper handling of external calls (e.g., sending Ether to multiple addresses) can also introduce DoS risks if one of the recipients causes the transaction to fail.",denial of service,4.0,557.0,6.0,4.751265287399292
136,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `send` in the `refundAll` function. Specifically, the line:

```solidity
require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));
```

If any of the addresses in `refundAddresses` rejects the `send` (due to gas limit issues or other reasons), the entire `refundAll` function will fail. This leads to a denial of service because no other address will be refunded, as the entire loop stops when one `send` fails. This makes the contract vulnerable to being locked up by a single failing address.",denial of service,3.0,563.0,6.0,3.0685009956359863
137,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is due to the same `for` loop in the `ifillArray` function, which can lead to a denial of service (DoS) by consuming excessive gas. Specifically, the loop iterates 350 times, pushing addresses into the `listAddresses` array. As the array grows in size, the gas required to execute the function increases, which could eventually exceed the block gas limit, preventing the function from being executed. This could cause the contract to become unusable, leading to a denial of service.",denial of service,3.0,548.0,6.0,2.9518392086029053
138,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is due to the line:

```solidity
require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));
```

This introduces a potential denial of service (DoS) vulnerability because `send()` only forwards 2300 gas, and if the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that has a fallback function requiring more than 2300 gas to execute, the `send()` will fail. As a result, no other bidder can replace the frontrunner, effectively preventing new bids and halting the auction, creating a DoS situation.",denial of service,3.0,554.0,6.0,3.327467679977417
