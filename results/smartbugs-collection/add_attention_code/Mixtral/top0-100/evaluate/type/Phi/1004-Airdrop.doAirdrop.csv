11,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function of the `MultiOwnable` contract.

The issue is that the `newOwner` function allows any user to become an owner of the contract by calling the function and passing their address as the `_owner` parameter. This means that any user can become an owner, even if they are not the root owner or an existing owner. This can lead to unauthorized access and control over the contract's functionality.

To fix this vulnerability, the `newOwner` function should be modified to include a check that ensures the user calling the function is either the root owner or an existing owner. This can be done by adding a condition in the `newOwner` function to check if the `msg.sender` is either the root owner or an existing owner before allowing them to become a new owner.",access control,3.0,706.0,6.0,0.8270938396453857

The vulnerability lies in the Airdrop contract, specifically in the doAirdrop function. The function allows any caller to execute the transferFrom function of the ERC20 token contract, without any access control checks. This means that an attacker can call the doAirdrop function and transfer tokens from the owner's account to any address they choose, as long as they provide the token address and the destination addresses and values.

The ERC20 token contract's transferFrom function is called without any access control checks, which means that the caller of the doAirdrop function can transfer tokens from the owner's account without the owner's permission. This is a serious access control vulnerability, as it allows an attacker to drain the owner's token balance.

To fix this vulnerability, the Airdrop contract should be modified to include access control checks before calling the ERC20 token contract's transferFrom function. This can be done by adding a modifier similar to the onlyowner modifier in the Missing contract, and applying it to the doAirdrop function or the transferFrom call within the doAirdrop function.",access control,3.0,760.0,6.0,0.8866050243377686

The `ERC20` contract does not have any access control checks to ensure that the caller of `transferFrom` is authorized to perform the transfer. This means that any user can call `transferFrom` and potentially drain funds from the `from` address if they have the necessary allowance.

In the `Airdrop` contract, the `doAirdrop` function calls `ERC2EE.transferFrom(msg.sender, dests[i], values[i])` without any access control checks. This allows any user to call the `doAirdrop` function and perform unauthorized transfers using the `ERC20` contract's `transferFrom` function.

To fix this vulnerability, the `ERC20` contract should implement access control checks in the `transferFrom` function to ensure that the caller is authorized to perform the transfer.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in both the `withdraw` and fallback functions. The `delegatecall` allows the contract to execute code in the context of another contract (in this case, `fibonacciLibrary`), which can lead to access control issues if the `fibonacciLibrary` contract is not properly designed to handle such calls securely.

In the `withdraw` function, the `delegatecall` is used to call the `setFibonacci` function of the `fibonacciLibrary` contract, which sets the `calculatedFibNumber` value. This value is then used to transfer ether to the `msg.sender`. If an attacker can control the `fibonacciLibrary` contract or influence its behavior, they could potentially manipulate the `calculatedFibNumber` value, leading to incorrect ether transfers.

Similarly, in the fallback function, the `delegatecall` is used to call a function based on the `msg.data` content. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the `fibonacciLibrary` contract, potentially leading to unautptacious behavior.

This could result in an incorrect balance that is lower than the actual amount, potentially leading to underflow issues or even allowing the caller to withdraw more tokens than they should be able to.",arithmetic,3.0,659.0,6.0,0.8632068634033203
78,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `IntegerOverflowMul` contract, specifically in the `run` function at line 17: `count *= input;`. This line of code is susceptible to integer overflow because it multiplies the `count` variable by the `input` without any checks for overflow.

In Solidity, when an integer overflow occurs, the result wraps around to the minimum value of the data type. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the contract's state.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin, which provides arithmetic operations with built-in overflow checks. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath to fix the vulnerability:

```solidity

The vulnerability lies in the `doAirdrop` function of the `Airdrop` contract. When calling the `transferFrom` function of the `ERC20` contract, there is no check to ensure that the `values[i]` does not cause an integer overflow. If the `values[i]` is large enough, it could cause an integer overflow when being added to the current balance of the `ERC20` token, leading to an incorrect balance and potentially allowing for theft or denial of service.",arithmetic,3.0,645.0,6.0,0.9069085121154785

The vulnerability lies in the `IntegerOverflowMinimal` contract, specifically in the `run` function. When the `input` value is greater than the current value of `count`, the subtraction operation will result in an underflow, causing the `count` variable to wrap around to a large positive value. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploitation.

Additionally, the `Airdrop` contract is also vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. In the `doAirdrop` function, the `values` array contains the amount of tokens to be transferred to each address. If the `values` array contains a value that is greater than the available balance of the token contract, it will result in an underflow, causing the balance to wrap around to a large positive value. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploitation.

To fix these vulnerabilities, you should use SafeMath library or similar libraries that provide safe arithmetic operations, or use Solidity version 0.8.0 or later, which has built-in overflow and underflow checks.",arithmetic,3.0,755.0,6.0,0.8458197116851807

The vulnerability lies in the `increaseLockTime` function, specifically in line 22:

```solidity
lockTime[msg.sender] += _secondsToIncrease;
```

In Solidity, the `+=` operator can cause an overflow if the result of the addition is larger than the maximum value of a `uint`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the lock time of an account.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflows and underflows. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath in the `increaseLockTime` function:

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the following lines:

1. Line 23: `require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`
2. Line 25: `balanceOf[msg.sender] += numTokens;`
3. Line 33: `msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`

In Solidity version 0.4.21, the `+=` and `*=` operators do not check for overflows and underflows. This means that if the result of the operation exceeds the maximum value of a uint256, it will wrap around to zero, leading to incorrect balances and potentially allowing attackers to manipulate the contract's state.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations that check for overflows and underflows. You can import the library and use its functions for addition and multiplication instead of the built-in operators.

The vulnerability lies in the `doAirdrop` function of the `Airdrop` contract. Specifically, the line `ERC20(_tokenAddr).transferFrom(msg.sender, dests[i], values[i]);` can cause an integer overflow if the `values[i]` is large enough.

In Solidity, the `transferFrom` function of the ERC20 token contract subtracts the `value` from the balance of the `from` address and adds it to the `to` address. If the `value` is too large, it can cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect balance update. This can be exploited by an attacker to drain funds from the contract or cause other unintended consequences.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library provided by OpenZeppelin, which includes overflow checks for arithmetic operations. Here's an example of how you can use SafeMath to prevent integer overflow in the `doAirdrop` function:

113,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `EtherBank` contract. The issue is the same as in the first example: the contract allows external calls to be made before the state of the contract is updated.

In the `withdrawBalance` function, the contract sends the user's balance to the `msg.sender` before updating the user's balance to 0. This allows a malicious contract to call the `withdrawBalance` function again before the balance is updated, effectively draining the user's balance.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the user's balance before sending the funds. Here's an updated version of the `withdrawBalance` function:

```solidity
function withdrawBalance() {  
    uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
    userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;

    if (!(msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)())) { throw; }

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. In this case, the external contract could be a malicious contract that calls the `Put` function again, draining the funds from the `Acc` mapping before the balance is updated in the `Collect` function.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests that you should first perform all checks and effects (updates to the state) before interacting with external contracts. In this case, you should update the balance in the `Acc` mapping before making the external call in the `Collect` function.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function (line 14-17). When the `withdrawBalance` function is called, it sends the entire balance of the user to the caller's address before updating the user's balance to zero. This allows a malicious contract to call the `transfer` function during the execution of the `withdrawBalance` function, potentially draining funds from the contract.

118,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrance` contract. The issue is that the contract allows external calls to be made before the state of the contract is updated. In this case, the `msg.sender.call.value(userBalance[msg.sender])()` line allows the `msg.sender` to call the `transferFrom` function of the `ERC20` contract before the `userBalance[msg.sender]` is set to 0.

This means that if the `ERC20` contract's `transferFrom` function is vulnerable to reentrancy, the `msg.sender` could call the `transferFrom` function multiple times, draining the contract's funds before the balance is updated to 0.

The vulnerability lies in line 38:

```solidity

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (the `msg.sender`) and sending Ether to it before updating the sender's balance in the `CashOut` function. This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `CashOut` function before the balance update is completed, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the balance update should be done before calling the external contract. Here's an updated version of the `CashOut` function:

This line allows the external contract to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. In this case, the Collect function is vulnerable to reentrancy because it allows the msg.sender to call the Deposit function before the balance is updated.

An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the Collect function and then calls the Deposit function within the same transaction. This would result in the attacker being able to withdraw more funds than they are entitled to, as the balance would not have been updated yet.

128,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation.

The vulnerability lies in the randomGen() function, which returns block.timestamp as a random number. Since miners have some leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, this can be manipulated to some extent. This can lead to predictable or biased randomness, which can be exploited by an attacker.

In the context of the lottopollo contract, this could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the random number generation in the draw() function, which in turn could affect the payouts in the payOut() function.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the lines where the current time is checked and stored:

1. require(now!= pastBlockTime); // only 1 transaction per block
2. pastBlockTime = now;

The contract assumes that the miner will report the correct time when mining the block. However, miners have some leeway in reporting the time, which can be manipulated to a certain extent. This can lead to the exploitation of the contract's logic, as the attacker can manipulate the time to trigger the transfer of funds at an unintended time.

In this specific contract, the vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the block time to make the condition `now % 15 == 0` true, which would result in the transfer of the contract's balance to the sender.

132,short addresses," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to short address attacks. The vulnerability lies in the `sendCoin` function, which uses the `address` type for the `to` parameter. In Solidity, the `address` type is 20 bytes, but when it is used in a transaction, it is padded to 32 bytes. If an attacker uses a short address (less than 20 bytes), the padding can be manipulated to change the intended recipient of the transaction.

To fix this issue, the `to` parameter in the `sendCoin` function should be changed to `address payable to`, which is a new type introduced in Solidity 0.6.0. This type ensages the correct padding and prevents short address attacks.

Additionally, the `ERC20` contract's `transferFrom` function should also be updated to use the `address payable` type for the `from` and `to` parameters to prevent short address attacks.

Here's the updated code:

An attacker can repeatedly call the `addCreditors` function to fill the `creditorAddresses` array until it reaches a length of 1500. Once this threshold is reached, the `emptyCreditors` function will be triggered, which clears the `creditorAddresses` array and sets the `win` variable to true. This can be exploited to disrupt the normal operation of the contract by repeatedly triggering the `emptyCreditors` function, effectively denying service to legitimate users who are trying to interact with the contract.",denial of service,3.0,665.0,6.0,0.8507869243621826

The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the contract attempts to dynamically resize the `array` if `numElements` reaches the current length of the `array`.

In Solidity, arrays are fixed-size data structures, and their size cannot be changed once they are initialized. The line `array.length += 1;` is attempting to change the size of the array, which is not allowed and will result in a runtime error. This error will cause the transaction to revert, effectively denying service to the user who initiated the transaction.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should be modified to allocate enough space for the `array` before inserting elements, or use a dynamic array type that allows resizing, such as `uint[]` or `uint[][]`.",denial of service,3.0,709.0,6.0,0.8119337558746338

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `ifillArray` function in the `DosOneFunc` contract. An attacker can repeatedly call this function, causing the contract to continuously fill the `listAddresses` array with the attacker's address until it reaches the limit of 1500 addresses. Once the limit is reached, the contract resets the array to an empty array, which is a wasteful operation and can lead to unnecessary gas consumption.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to consume the contract's gas limit, potentially leading to a denial of service for other users trying to interact with the contract.",denial of service,3.0,667.0,6.0,0.9044137001037598

The smart contract code provided is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to the same issue as the first contract. The vulnerability lies in the `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid))` line in the `bid` function. This line attempts to send the current bid amount to the current frontrunner. If the current frontrunner has insufficient funds or the transaction fails for any reason, the `require` statement will revert the transaction, effectively denying service to the caller who attempted to bid.

In a DoS attack scenario, an attacker could repeatedly call the `bid` function with a value greater than the current bid, causing the contract to attempt to send funds to the current frontrunner. If the current frontrunner has insusinfficient funds or the transaction fails, the contract will revert, and the attacker can keep calling the function, preventing legitimate users from placing bids.",denial of service,3.0,716.0,6.0,0.8334107398986816
