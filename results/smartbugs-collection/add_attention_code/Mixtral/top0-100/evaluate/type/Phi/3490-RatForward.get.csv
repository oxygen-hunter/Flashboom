13,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` to validate callers and the lack of proper access control checks in the `get()` function.

In the `init()` function, the contract checks the `msg.value` to determine if the sender is the creator. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent unauthorized access to the contract's functionality. An attacker can create a contract that calls the `get()` function, which in turn calls the `transfer()` function to send funds to the contract's creator and another address. This can lead to unauthorized fund transfers.

Additionally, the `get()` function does not have any access control checks, allowing anyone to call it and potentially exploit the contract's functionality.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a more secure access control mechanism, such as using a modifier to restrict access to specific functions, and avoid using `tx.origin` for validation.",access control,3.0,717.0,6.0,1.026796579360962

26,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in both the `withdraw` and fallback functions. The `delegatecall` allows the contract to execute code in the context of another contract, which can lead to access control issues if not properly managed. In this case, the `delegatecall` is used to call functions in the `fibonacciLibrary` contract, which could potentially be controlled by an attacker.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `delegatecall` does not check the caller's permissions, allowing an attacker to potentially call sensitive functions in the `fibonacciLibrary` contract. This can lead to unautorized access to the contract's private data or logic, which can be exploited by an attacker.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use `call` instead of `delegatecall` and ensure that the caller's permissions are properly checked before executing any sensitive functions in the `fibonacciLibrary` contract. Additionally, the contract should avoid using `tx.origin` for access control and instead use a more secure method like the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.",access control,3.0,753.0,6.0,0.8425672054290771

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the `send` function in the `cash` function at line 109 and the `send` function in the fallback function at line 141. The `send` function does not revert the transaction if the transfer fails, which can lead to a fail-open situation where the contract continues to execute even after a failed transfer. This can result in unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `send` function should be replaced with the `transfer` function, which reverts the transaction if the transfer fails. The `transfer` function is safer to use as it ensures that the transaction is reverted in case of a failed transfer, preventing any further execution of the contract code.

In this contract, the function `get()` is public and can be called by any external address. This function transfers half of the contract's balance to one address and the other half to another address. Since the contract's balance can change over time, an attacker can observe the balance and determine when the contract has enough funds to make the transfers.

An attacker can then create a transaction with a higher gas price to call the `solve()` function before the legitimate user does. By solving the puzzle and calling `solve()`, the attacker can claim the 1000 ether reward before the legitimate user's transaction is mined. This is a front-running attack, as the attacker is taking advantage of the information about the contract's balance and the timing of transactions to steal the reward.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should not have a public function that transfers funds based on the contract's balance. Additionally, the contract could implement a mechanism to prevent multiple transactions from claiming the same reward, such as by using a queue or a timestamp to ensure that only the first valid solution is rewarded.",front running,3.0,775.0,6.0,0.9022421836853027

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the function `WithdrawToHolder` in the `TokenBank` contract. The line `if(_addr.call.value(_wei)())` allows for a reentrancy attack because it sends Ether to `_addr` before updating the `Holders` mapping. If `_addr` is a malicious contract with a fallback function designed to call back into the `WithdrawToEEnergy` function, it can withdraw more Ether than intended or even drain the contract's funds.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `supportsToken()` function of the `attack` contract. When `supportsToken()` is called, it checks if `hasBeenCalled` is false, and if so, it sets it to true and calls `ModifierEntrancy(msg.sender).airDrop()`. This allows the `airDrop()` function to be called before the state of the `attack` contract is updated, which can lead to reentrancy.

In the `airDrop()` function of the `ModifierEntrancy` contract, the token balance of the sender is increased by EEE. If an attacker has a fallback function in their contract that calls `supportsToken()` again, they can drain the contract's funds before the balance update is recorded.

Each iteration of the loop consumes gas, and if an attacker calls this function with a very high `numbers` value, it could exhaust the gas available to the transaction, causing it to fail and potentially leading to a DoS situation if the contract is critical to the application's functionality.",denial of service,3.0,642.0,6.0,0.8237087726593018

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the reset of the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays in lines 46 and 48. This reset occurs every time a new credit cycle starts, which is defined by the condition `lastTimeOfNewCredit + TWELVE_HOURS < block.timestamp`. When the arrays are reset, all the previous creditor addresses and amounts are lost, and any attempt to access them will result in an out-of-bounds error, effectively making the contract unresponsive to those creditors.

This vulnerability can be exploited by repeatedly calling the `lendGovernmentMoney` function with a small amount of Ether, triggering a new credit cycle and resetting the arrays. This will prevent legitimate creditors from receiving their funds, as their addresses and amounts will be lost in the reset.",denial of service,3.0,705.0,6.0,0.8008978366851807

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the same reason as the first contract. The vulnerability lies in line 24:

```solidity
require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));
```

This line attempts to send the entire balance of the contract to each refund address in the `refundAddresses` array. If any of the `send` operations fail, the entire function will fail, and the contract will not be able to process any further refunds. This can be exploited by an attacker by simply calling the `refundAll` function, causing the contract to get stuck in a state where it cannot process any more transactions.",denial of service,3.0,670.0,6.0,0.8158831596374512
137,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `get()` function (lines 11-14). This function transfers the contract's entire balance to two external addresses. If an attacker calls this function multiple times, they can deplete the contract's balance, making it impossible for the contract to perform any operations that require gas, such as the `ifillArray()` function.

By draining the contract's balance, the attacker can effectively deny service to legitimate users who want to interact with the contract. This is a type of denial of service attack, as it prevents the contract from functioning as intended.",denial of service,3.0,661.0,6.0,0.8220658302307129
138,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `get()` function (line 13-16). This function transfers half of the contract's balance to the address `0x20C945800de43394F70D789874a4daC9cFA57451` and the other half to the address `0x83c0Efc6d8B16D87BFe1335AB6BcAb3Ed3960285`.

If an attacker calls the `get()` function multiple times, they can drain the contract's balance, making it impossible for the contract to function properly. This can lead to a denial of service, as the contract will not be able to process any further transactions or execute its intended functionality.",denial of service,3.0,692.0,6.0,0.832432746887207
