The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function (line 38) of the `MultiOwnable` contract. The function allows any user to become an owner by calling it, without any proper authorization checks. This means that any user can become an owner and gain control over the contract's functions that are restricted to owners only.

To fix this vulnerability, the `newOwner` function should be modified to include proper authorization checks, ensuring that only the root owner or the current owner can add new owners. This can be achieved by adding an `onlyOwner` modifier to the `newOwner` function, similar to the `deleteOwner` function.",access control,3.0,674.0,6.0,0.8317255973815918
12,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, which inherits from the `BaseToken` contract. The `CustomToken` constructor assigns the entire token supply to a single address (0x873c50dcac16d9db1b67d7c6ff596f69981c4c71) and then emits a `Transfer` event to itself. This means that the single address now has full control over the token supply.

An attacker could create a malicious contract that calls the `CustomToken` constructor and then use the `onlyowner` modifier in the `Missing` contract to call the `withdraw` function, effectively draining the entire token supply to their own address. This is a subtle access control bypass, as the `onlyowner` modifier relies on the `owner` variable, which is set in the `missing` function.

To fix this vulnerability, the `CustomToken` constructor should be modified to distribute the token supply among multiple addresses or use a more secure method for assigning the initial token supply. Additionally, the `Missing` contract should be reviewed to ensure that the `owner` variable is set securely and that the `onlyowner` modifier is used correctly.",access control,3.0,784.0,6.0,0.8490481376647949

This means that any user can call the `addPayout` function and send Ether to the `Participant` addresses, potentially draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `addPayout` function should be modified to include a modifier that checks if the caller is the `creator` before executing the function. This can be done by adding a `creatorOnly` modifier and using it in the `addPayout` function, like this:

```solidity

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function, specifically in line 20:

```solidity
require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);
```

This line allows any user to withdraw their balance, which is correct. However, the issue arises when considering the `migrateTo` function in the `Wallet` contract. The `migrateTo` function allows the `creator` to transfer the entire balance of the contract to another address. Since the `creator` is the only one who can call this function, it is not an access control issue in itself.

However, if the `CustomToken` contract is deployed using the `Wallet` contract as its constructor, the `creator` of the `CustomToken` contract would also be the `creator` of the `Wallet` contract. This means that the `creator` of the `CustomToken` contract can call the `migrateTo` function of the `Wallet` contract and transfer the entire balance of the `CustomToken` contract to any address.

This is a potential access control issue because the `creator` of the `CustomToken` contract may not be the intended owner of the funds, and they could transfer the funds to an unintended address. To mitigate this issue",access control,3.0,793.0,6.0,0.8689391613006592

This line assigns the entire supply of tokens to the address `0x873c50dcac16d9db1b67d7c6ff596f69981c4c71` during contract deployment. This means that the deployer of the contract has full control over the tokens, which is a significant access control issue.

The `onlyowner` modifier in the `Missing` contract is not sufficient to prevent this vulnerability, as the `CustomToken` contract does not use the `Missing` contract's functionality. The `CustomToken` contract's constructor is executed during deployment, and the `onlyowner` modifier does not apply to it.

This function allows anyone to modify the `map` array, which could lead to unauthorized changes in the contract's state.

In the provided code, there is no access control mechanism to restrict who can call the `set` function. This means that any user can call the `set` function and modify the `map` array, potentially leading to unintended consequences or manipulation of the contract's data.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add an access control mechanism to restrict who can call the `set` function. One way to do this is by using a modifier that checks if the caller is the owner of the contract. Here's an example of how you can modify the code to add access control:

19,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function. The `CustomToken` contract inherits from the `BaseToken` contract and has a constructor that assigns the entire token supply to a single address (0x873c50dcac16d9db1b67d7c6ff596f69981c4c71) and then logs a transfer event.

The vulnerability is related to the event logging. The `Transfer` event is emitted with the sender as `address(0)`, which is the zero address. This can be exploited by an attacker to create a malicious contract that listens for `Transfer` events with a zero address as the sender. When the `CustomToken` contract is deployed, the malicious contract will receive the event and can potentially use the information for nefarious purposes, such as phishing attacks or impersonation.

To fix this vulnerability, the `CustomToken` constructor should emit the `Transfer` event with the correct sender address, which is the address of the contract itself (this.address).",access control,2.0,752.0,6.0,0.9421231746673584

Since the `creator` is set in the `initWallet` function and is not protected, any user who calls `initWallet` can set themselves as the `creator`. This allows them to bypass the `require(creator == msg.sender);` check in the `migrateTo` function and transfer the contract's balance to any address they choose.

To fix this vulnerability, the `creator` should be set in the constructor of the contract and not be accessible or modifiable by any other function.

However, `tx.origin` is considered deprecated and unreliable for access control in Solidity, as it can be easily spoofed by malicious actors.

A better approach to access control would be to use a modifier that checks if the caller is the owner, like this:

This can be exploited by an attacker who is not the intended recipient of the refund.

In Solidity, `msg.sender` is the address that is currently calling the contract. In the context of the `refund` function, `msg.sender` is the address that initiated the refund transaction. However, this does not necessarily mean that the address is authorized to receive the refund. An attacker could call the `refund` function from an unauthorized address and receive the funds intended for the original owner.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should implement proper access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized addresses can call the `refund` function.

This line uses the `send()` function, which is a low-level function that does not revert the transaction if it fails. If the `send()` function fails, the `withdrawBalance()` function will continue to execute, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the `transfer()` function instead of `send()`. The `transfer()` function reverts the entire transaction if the transfer fails, ensuring that the `withdrawBalance()` function does not continue to execute after a failed transfer.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the contract allows for the approval of an arbitrary amount of tokens to be spent by a spender, without any time constraints or limits on the value that can be approved. This can lead to front-running attacks, where a malicious user can observe pending transactions and approve a higher value to be spent by the same spender, effectively stealing the intended transaction.

In the provided code, the vulnerability is not directly related to the lines mentioned in the question (line 110 and line 113). Instead, the vulnerability is due to the lack of time constraints or limits on the value that can be approved in the `approve` function.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should implement time constraints or limits on the value that can be approved, or use a more secure mechanism for managing token allowances, such as the ERC20EIP-224 (SafeMath) library used in the provided code.",front running,4.0,717.0,6.0,2.5161678791046143

The vulnerability lies in the way the `play` function processes transactions. Since the `play` function is payable and public, users can submit transactions to the contract with higher gas fees to have their transactions mined more quickly. An attacker can observe the pending transactions and see the addresses and numbers being played. If the attacker sees a transaction that is likely to win, they can submit their own transaction with a higher gas fee to be mined first, effectively stealing the winnings.

In this contract, the `play` function is payable and public, and the `andTheWinnerIs` function determines the winner based on the numbers submitted by the players. This creates an opportunity for front running attacks, as described above.",front running,4.0,676.0,6.0,2.450155258178711

The vulnerability lies in the `init` function of the `IntegerOverflowMappingSym1` contract, where it subtracts `v` from the value of `map[k]`. If `map[k]` is smaller than `v`, this operation will result in an underflow, causing the value to wrap around to a very large number. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploits.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin, which provides arithmetic operations with built-in overflow checks. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath to fix the vulnerability:

The vulnerability lies in the `IntegerOverflowMul` contract, specifically in the `run` function at line 17: `count *= input;`. This line of code is susceptible to integer overflow because it multiplies the `count` variable by the `input` without any checks for overflow.

In Solidity, when an integer overflow occurs, the result wraps around to the minimum value of the data type. This can lead to unexpected and potentially harmful behavior in smart contracts. For example, if the `count` variable reaches a value that, when multiplied by `input`, causes an overflow, the resulting value will be incorrect and could be exploited by an attacker.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The line `balanceOf[0x873c50dcac16d9db1b67d7c6ff596f69981c4c71] = totalSupply;` is vulnerable to integer overflow.

In Solidity, the `mapping` data structure is initialized with a default value of 0 for all keys. When assigning a value to a key that has not been accessed before, the assignment operation is equivalent to adding the value to the current value of the key. In this case, the key `0x873c50dcac1sin6d9db1b67d7c6ff596f69981c4c71` has not been accessed before, so the assignment operation is equivalent to adding `totalSupply` to the current value of the key, which is 0.

However, the `totalSupply` value is very large (5000000000000000000000000000), and adding it to 0 may cause an integer overflow, resulting in an incorrect balance value for the address `0x8",arithmetic,3.0,777.0,6.0,0.8189849853515625
85,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the `CustomToken()` constructor function. The issue is that the `totalSupply` is set to a very large number (5000000000000000000000000000), and then the entire supply is transferred to the address `0x873c50dcac16d9db1b67d7c6ff596f69981c4c71`.

The problem arises when the `balanceOf` mapping is accessed with the large `totalSupply` value. Since the `balanceOf` mapping is a key-value storage, the key is hashed to a smaller size (256 bits). If the `totalSupply` is too large, it may cause an integer overflow when hashing the key, leading to an incorrect address being used in the `Transfer` event. This can result in funds being sent to an unintended address, potentially leading to loss of funds or other unintended consequences.

The vulnerability lies in the operations that perform addition, multiplication, and subtraction on the `count` variable, which is of type `uint256`. In Solidity, `uint256` is an unsigned integer type that can lead to overflow and underflow issues if not handled properly.

The vulnerable lines in the code are:

1. Line 18: `count += input;`

This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `Collect` function before the balance update is completed, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the balance update should be done before the external call, and the contract should use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. Here's an updated version of the `Collect` function:

```solidity
function Collect(uint _am)
    public
    payable
    {
        var acc = Acc[msg.sender];

108,reentrancy," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the function `WithdrawToHolder` in the `TokenBank` contract. The issue is the same as in the original code you provided: the contract state is modified (the balance of the holder is decreased) after a call to an external contract (`_addr.call.value(_wei)()`). If `_addr` is a malicious contract, it could re-enter the `WithdrawToHolder` function before the balance update is executed, potentially draining funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you should follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern, which means updating the contract state (effects) before making external calls (interactions). Here's an example of how to fix the `WithdrawToHolder` function:

```solidity
function WithdrawToHolder(address _addr, uint _wei) 
    public

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawAll` function of the `ReentrancyDAO` contract. The issue is the same as in the first example you provided: the contract allows external calls to be made before the state of the contract is updated.

In the `withdrawAll` function, the contract sends Ether to the `msg.sender` before updating the `credit` mapping. This means that if the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract that has a fallback function designed to call back into the `withdrawAll` function, it can potentially withdraw more Ether than it should.

To fix this vulnerability, you should update the `credit` mapping before sending Ether to the `msg.sender`. Here's an updated version of the `withdrawAll` function:

The issue here is that Solidity does not allow resizing an array by directly modifying its length property. The line `array.length += 1;` is not valid Solidity code and will result in a compilation error.

However, the intention behind this line is to resize the array when it reaches its current length. The correct way to resize an array in Solidity is by using the `push` method, which automatically resizes the array and adds the element to the end.

To fix this vulnerability, the `insertNnumbers` function should be updated to use the `push` method:

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the reset of the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays in the `lendGovernmentMoney` function. This reset occurs every time a new credit cycle starts, which is defined by the condition `lastTimeOfNewCredit + TWELVE_HOURS < block.timestamp`. When the arrays are reset, all the previously stored creditor addresses and amounts are lost, which can be exploited by repeatedly calling the `lendGovernmentMoney` function to prevent the system from functioning correctly.

An attacker can call the `lendGovernmentMoney` function with a small amount of Ether, triggering the reset of the arrays and effectively halting the system from processing any further transactions. This can lead to a denial of service, as the contract will not be able to process any new transactions until the next credit cycle starts.

To fix this vulnerability, the reset of the arrays should be removed or handled in a more controlled manner, ensuring that the system can continue to function even after a new credit cycle starts.",denial of service,3.0,750.0,6.0,0.8596591949462891
