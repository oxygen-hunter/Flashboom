11,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function in the `MultiOwnable` contract.

The issue is that the `newOwner` function allows any user to become an owner by calling the function and passing their address as the `_owner` parameter. This means that any user can become an owner, even if they are not the root owner or an existing owner. This can lead to unauthorized users gaining control over the contract's functionality and potentially causing harm.

To fix this vulnerability, the `newOwner` function should be modified to only allow the root owner or existing owners to add new owners. This can be achieved by adding an additional check in the `newOwner` function to ensure that the user calling the function is either the root owner or an existing owner.",access control,3.0,697.0,6.0,0.8331954479217529
12,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, which inherits from the `BaseToken` contract. The issue is with the constructor of the `CustomToken` contract, specifically the line:

```solidity
balanceOf[0x57cad6a4c83286406fd0fc9218931b3b83853e65] = totalSupply;
```

This line assigns the entire token supply to a single address (0x57cad6a4c83286406fd0fc9218931b3b83853e65) during contract deployment. This means that the owner of this address will have full control over the token supply, which is a significant access control issue.

The `owner` variable in the `Missing` contract is set to `msg.sender` when the `missing` function is called. Since the `missing` function is public, any user can call it and set themselves as the owner of the `Missing` contract. This allows them to call the `withdraw` function and transfer all the balance of the `Missing` contract to themselves.

In summary, the vulnerability is due to the combination of the `CustomToken` contract assigning",access control,3.0,779.0,6.0,0.8384172916412354

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the `msg.sender` check in the `DynamicPyramid` function. This function allows any user to call it and set the `creator` variable to their address. This means that any user can become the owner of the contract, which can lead to unauthorized access and control over the contract's functionality.

To fix this vulnerability, the `DynamicPyramid` function should only be callable by the original deployer of the contract or a designated admin address.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity

This line allows any user to withdraw their balance, which is correct. However, the issue arises when considering the `migrateTo` function:

```solidity
function migrateTo(address to) public {
    require(creator == msg.sender);
    to.transfer(this.balance);
}
```

In this function, the `creator` can transfer the entire contract balance to any address. This means that the `creator` has unrestricted access to the contract's funds, which is a significant access control vulnerability.

To fix this issue, the `migrateTo` function should be restricted to only allow the `creator` to transfer their own balance, not the entire contract balance. This can be achieved by adding an additional check in the `migrateTo` function to ensure that the `to` address is the `creator`'s address.",access control,3.0,740.0,6.0,0.9435782432556152
15,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being updated with the `totalSupply` before the constructor has finished executing. This can lead to a situation where the `balanceOf` mapping is accessible and modifiable by other contracts or functions before the contract is fully initialized, potentially leading to an attack where the initial balance is changed.

To fix this vulnerability, the `balanceOf` mapping should be updated after the constructor has finished executing. This can be done by moving the line `balanceOf[0x57cad6a4c83286406fd0fc9218931b3b83853e65] = totalSupply;` after the `Transfer` event emission line.",access control,3.0,700.0,6.0,0.8547437191009521

19,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. The `onlyowner` modifier checks if the `msg.sender` is equal to the `owner`, which is fine for basic access control. However, the issue arises with the `CustomToken` contract, which inherits from `BaseToken`. The constructor of `CustomToken` is marked as `public`, which means it can be called by any external account, not just the owner.

When the `CustomToken` contract is deployed, the `Constructor` function of the `CustomToken` contract is called, which sets the `totalSupply` and other token properties. However, since the `Constructor` function is public, any external account can deploy the `CustomToken` contract, effectively bypassing the `onlyowner` modifier in the `Missing` contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `CustomToken` contract's constructor should be marked as `internal` or `private`, so that only the deploying account can call it. Additionally, the `Missing` contract should be updated to use the `msg.sender` instead of `tx.origin` for access control checks.",access control,3.0,768.0,6.0,0.8314049243927002

The vulnerability lies in the constructor of the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the line where it assigns the total supply to the address `0x57cad6a4c83286406fd0fc9218931b3b83853e65`:

```solidity

```

This line of code assigns the entire token supply to a single address, which is a security risk. If an attacker gains control of this address, they would have control over the entire token supply. This is a form of access control bypass, as the contract is not properly validating or restricting who can receive the entire token supply.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should implement a more secure way of distributing the token supply, such as using a crowdsale or airdrop mechanism that distributes tokens to multiple addresses, or by implementing a more secure access control mechanism to ensure that only authorized addresses can receive the entire token supply.",access control,3.0,769.0,6.0,0.8327112197875977
24,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The `balanceOf` mapping is being set for the address `0x57cad6a4c83286406fd0fc9218931b3b83853e65` with the entire total supply of tokens. This means that the address `0x57cad6a4c83286406fd0fc9218931b3b83853e65` has full control over the tokens, and if this address is compromised or falls into the wrong hands, the entire token supply could be at risk.

Additionally, the `changeOwner` function in the `Unprotected` contract allows anyone to change the owner of the contract without any restrictions. This means that if the `CustomToken` contract is somehow linked to the `Unprotected` contract, an attacker could change the owner of the `Unprotected` contract and gain control over the `CustomToken` contract as well.

To fix this vulnerability, the `CustomToken` contract should not pre-assign the entire token supply to a single address. Instead, the tokens should be distributed among multiple addresses or through a more secure distribution mechanism. The `change",access control,4.0,788.0,6.0,1.086576223373413

In this case, the `withdraw` function and the fallback function are allowing any contract to call the `FibonacciLib` functions, which could lead to unauthorized access to the `calculatedFibNumber` state variable.

To fix this vulnerability, you should remove the `delegatecall` from both the `withdraw` function and the fallback function, and instead use direct function calls to the `FibonacciLib` contract.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the `CustomToken()` constructor function. The line `balanceOf[0x57cad6a4c83286406fd0fc9218931b3b83853e65] = totalSupply;` is vulnerable to integer overflow.

In Solidity, when assigning a value to a mapping, the value is implicitly converted to the key type. In this case, the `balanceOf` mapping has a `uint256` type, and the `totalSupply` variable is also a `uint256`. When assigning `totalSupply` to the `balanceOf` mapping, the value is implicitly converted to a `uint256`.

However, the `totalSupply` variable is initialized with a value of `1000000000000000000000000000`, which is a very large number. When this value is assigned to the `balanceOf` mapping, it may cause an integer overflow, as the maximum value of a `uint25EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE",arithmetic,3.0,758.0,6.0,0.8497254848480225

If the `totalSupply` variable is increased beyond the maximum value of a uint256 (2^256 - 1), it will cause an integer overflow, resulting in an incorrect balance for the address `0x57cad6a4c83286406fd0fc9218931b3b83853e65`. This can lead to incorrect calculations and potentially allow for exploits such as double-spending or stealing funds.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow due to the use of unsigned integer operations without proper checks. Solidity version 0.4.23 does not have built-in overflow checks, and the operations in the functions `overflowaddtostate`, `overflowmultostate`, `underflowtostate`, `overflowlocalonly`, `overflowmulocalonly`, and `underflowlocalonly` can lead to overflow and underflow issues.",arithmetic,3.0,624.0,6.0,0.8151659965515137

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the same type of arithmetic overflow issue as the first example. The vulnerability lies in the `transfer` function, specifically in the lines:

```solidity
require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
```

In Solidity version 0.4.18, the `uint` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When subtracting `_value` from `balances[msg.sender]`, if the result is less than zero, it will wrap around to a very large positive number due to the nature of unsigned integer arithmetic. This can lead to an incorrect balance update and potentially allow the attacker to drain funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations, or upgrade to a newer Solidity version (0.8.x or above) that includes built-in overflow checks.",arithmetic,3.0,722.0,6.0,0.8159339427947998

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the `CustomToken()` constructor function. The line `balanceOf[0x57cad6a4c83286406fd0fc9218931b3b83853e65] = totalSupply;` is vulnerable to integer overflow.

In Solidity, when assigning a value to a mapping, the right-hand side of the assignment is implicitly converted to the type of the mapping's value. In this case, the `balanceOf` mapping has a type of `uint256`, and `totalSupply` is also a `uint256`. However, the value of `totalSupply` is 1e24, which is a very large number.

When assigning this large value to the `balanceOf` mapping, there is a risk of integer overflow. If the value of `totalSupply` exceeds the maximum value of a `uint2EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE` (2^256 - 1), the assignment will result in an incorrect value being stored in the `balanceOf` mapping. This can lead to incorrect balances and potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the contract's state.

The vulnerability lies in the line `balanceOf[_to] += _value;` in the `transfer` function of the `IntegerOverflowAdd` contract. In Solidity version 0.4.10, there is no built-in overflow checking for unsigned integer operations. If the addition of `_value` to `balanceOf[_to]` results in an overflow, the value will wrap around to a smaller number, leading to incorrect balances and potential loss of funds.

However, this hash is predictable and can be influenced by miners, as they can choose which transactions to include in a block. This predictability can be exploited by a malicious user who can observe the blockchain and predict the `blockhash` for future blocks.

In the `settle` function, the contract uses `blockhash(guesses[msg.sender].block)` to generate the answer. Since the `blockhash` is predictable, a malicious user can observe the blockchain and predict the `blockhash` for the block number specified in the `guesses` mapping. This allows them to lock in a guess that will always match the `blockhash`, enabling them to win the challenge and receive the 2 ether reward.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a more secure source of randomness, such as an off-chain random number generation service or a decentralized randomness beacon like Chainlink VRF.",bad randomness,3.0,749.0,6.0,0.8177351951599121

The vulnerability lies in line 52:

```solidity

In this line, the contract is sending Ether to the `msg.sender` before updating the balance. If the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract with a fallback function that calls back into the `CashOut` function, it can withdraw more Ether than it should, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance before sending Ether to the `msg.sender`. Here's an updated version of the `CashOut` function:

```solidity
function CashOut(uint _am)

120,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 38 of the CashOut function:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the calling contract (PrivateBank) before the initial execution is complete. If the external contract is malicious and has a fallback function that calls the CashOut function again, it can drain the funds from the PrivateBank contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests that you should first perform all checks (e.g., balance validation), then perform all effects (e.g., updating balances), and finally interact with external contracts.

Here's an updated version of the CashOut function that follows this pattern:

function CashOut(uint _am) public {
    require(_am <= balances[msg.sender], ""Insufficient balance"");
    balances[msgEE] -= _am;
    msg.sender.transfer(_am);

This line of code sends `_am` amount of Ether to the `msg.sender` address and waits for the call to return true before continuing. If the `msg.sender` address is a malicious contract with a fallback function designed to re-enter the contract (i.e., calling another function in the same contract), it can potentially withdraw funds from the contract before the balance update is executed.

This line checks if the current block timestamp is at least one minute after the last investment timestamp before allowing the resetInvestment function to proceed. However, miners have the ability to manipulate the block timestamp within a certain range (usually 15 seconds). This means that an attacker could potentially mine a block with a timestamp that is just under one minute after the last investment timestamp, bypassing the time check and triggering the resetInvestment function.

As a result, the attacker could exploit this vulnerability to reset the jackpot and steal the funds from the last investor, as well as the owner's balance.",time manipulation,3.0,686.0,6.0,0.8631682395935059

- Line 20: `pastBlockTime = now;`

These lines ensure that only one transaction per block can transfer the balance to the sender. However, miners have some leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred. An attacker can exploit this by mining a block with a timestamp that is a multiple of 15 seconds after the previous block's timestamp.

132,short addresses," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to short address attacks. The vulnerability lies in the `sendCoin` function, where the `address` type is used without explicitly checking for the full length of the address. In Solidity, the `address` type is 20 bytes, but when passing an address to a function, it is recommended to use the `address payable` type and check for the full length of the address to prevent short address attacks.

To fix this vulnerability, you can modify the `sendCoin` function to use `address payable` and check for the full length of the address:

```solidity
function sendCoin(address payable to, uint amount) returns(bool sufficient) {
    if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) return false;
    balances[msgEE.sender] -= amount;
    balances[to] += amount;
    Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);

133,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `emptyCreditors` function can be called repeatedly to keep clearing the `creditorAddresses` array, which can lead to a situation where the contract is unable to process legitimate transactions or functions that depend on the `creditorAddresses` array.

In the provided code, the `emptyCreditors` function checks if the length of the `creditorAddresses` array is greater than 1500. If it is, the function clears the array and sets the `win` variable to true. An attacker can repeatedly call the `addCreditors` function to add addresses to the `creditorAddresses` array, and then call the `emptyCreditors` function to clear the array. This can be done in a loop or by using recursive calls, leading to a Denial of Service attack.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you can add a check to prevent the `emptyCreditors` function from being called too frequently or by the same address. Additionally, you can limit the rate at which the `addCreditors` function can be called or implement a mechanism to prevent the same address from adding multiple times in a short period.",denial of service,3.0,795.0,6.0,0.9023542404174805
134,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles the dynamic resizing of the `array` when inserting elements. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the contract checks if `numElements` is equal to `array.length` and then increments `array.length` by 1.

In Solidity, when you try to access an element of an array at an index that is out of bounds, it will throw an exception and revert the transaction. However, in this case, the contract is not checking if the new `array.length` is within bounds before trying to access it. This can lead to an out-of-bounds access, causing the transaction to revert and effectively denying service to the user who initiated the transaction.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the `push` method to add elements to the array, which automatically handles resizing and prevents out-of-bounds access. Here's an updated version of the `insertNnumbers` function:

```solidity
function insertNnumbers(uint value, uint numbers) public {
    for (uint i = 0; i < numbers; i++) {

This line attempts to send Ether to each address in the `refundAddresses` array. If any of the `send` operations fail, the entire `refundAll` function will fail due to the `require` statement. This can be exploited by an attacker who can control one of the addresses in the `refundAddresses` array. By sending a transaction to that address, the attacker can cause the `refundAll` function to fail, effectively denying service to all other addresses in the array.

Additionally, the `send` function itself is considered unsafe and can lead to denial of service attacks. It is recommended to use the `transfer` function instead, which reverts the entire transaction if the transfer fails. However, even with `transfer`, the same vulnerability would still exist if an attacker can control one of the addresses in the `refundAddresses` array.",denial of service,3.0,755.0,6.0,0.8990163803100586
137,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function of the `DosOneFunc` contract. An attacker can repeatedly call this function, causing the `listAddresses` array to fill up with the attacker's address. Once the array reaches its maximum size of 1500, the function will clear the array by setting it to a new empty array. This process can be repeated indefinitely, causing the contract to consume resources and potentially leading to a Denial of Service condition.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the `ifillArray` function, which will consume gas and potentially overload the contract's execution environment. This can lead to a Denial of Service condition, where the contract becomes unresponsive or unavailable to legitimate users.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should implement a mechanism to limit the rate at which the `ifillArray` function can be called, or to prevent the function from being called by the same address repeatedly.",denial of service,3.0,741.0,6.0,0.8396708965301514
