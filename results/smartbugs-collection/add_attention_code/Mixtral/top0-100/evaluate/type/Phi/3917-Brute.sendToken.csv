This line is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The `Brute` contract does not check if the `_contract` address is a contract or not, and it does not use the `onlyOwner` modifier from the `MultiOwnable` contract.

In a reentrancy attack, an attacker can call the `transferFrom` function of the ERC20 token contract repeatedly before the first call is finished, potentially draining the contract's funds. This is possible because the `transferFrom` function does not have any internal state changes that would prevent the reentrancy.

To fix this vulnerability, the `sendToken` function should verify that the `_contract` address is indeed an ERC20 token contract before calling `transferFrom`.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract could implement a random delay or use a commit-reveal scheme to prevent front running.",front running,3.0,703.0,6.0,0.806145191192627
75,front running," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to front-running. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the contract allows anyone to call the `approve` function and set the allowance for a spender without any restrictions. This means that a malicious user can observe pending transactions and set a high allowance for a spender, effectively front-running other transactions that intend to use the same spender.

For example, if a user wants to call the `transferFrom` function to send tokens from one address to another, a malicious user can observe this pending transaction and call the `approve` function to set a high allowance for the spender. This would allow the malicious user to call the `transferFrom` function with a higher value, effectively stealing the tokens intended for the original transaction.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should implement a mechanism to prevent front-running, such as adding a delay or using a more secure method to set allowances.",front running,3.0,711.0,6.0,0.7711424827575684
76,front running," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to front running.

The vulnerability lies in the way the `play` function processes transactions. Since the `play` function is payable and public, users can see the transactions in the blockchain. A malicious user can observe a transaction that is about to be mined and create a new transaction with a higher gas price to be mined first. This can lead to the malicious user winning the game instead of the original user who initiated the transaction.

In this specific contract, the `play` function is responsible for determining the winner of the game based on the sum of the numbers submitted by the players. If a malicious user sees a transaction that is about to be mined and knows the number submitted by the original user, they can submit their own transaction with a higher gas price and a number that will result in a tie, ensuring that they win the game instead of the original user.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract could be modified to use a random number generator or a time-based mechanism to determine the winner, rather than relying on the order of transactions.",front running,3.0,746.0,6.0,0.8530042171478271

The vulnerability lies in the `IntegerOverflowMappingSym1` contract, specifically in the `init` function. The line `map[k] -= v;` can cause an underflow if the value of `map[k]` is 0 and `v` is greater than 0. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially be exploited by an attacker.

However, the `Brute` contract itself is not directly vulnerable to integer overflow. The `sendToken` function calls the `transferFrom` function of the `ERC20` contract, which is not shown in the code snippet. If the `ERC20` contract is properly implemented and does not have integer overflow vulnerabilities, then the `Brute` contract would not be vulnerable to integer overflow.

In summary, the `IntegerOverflowMappingSym1` contract is vulnerable to integer overflow, but the `Brute` contract is not directly vulnerable unless the `ERC2EE` contract has integer overflow vulnerabilities.",arithmetic,3.0,736.0,6.0,0.8705554008483887

When an overflow occurs, the result wraps around and starts from 0, leading to unexpected and potentially exploitable behavior.

In the context of the `Brute` contract, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the `sendToken` function with a large value of `_value`. This could cause the `transferFrom` function in the `ERC20` contract to overflow, potentially leading to the loss of tokens or other unintended consequences.",arithmetic,3.0,685.0,6.0,1.0656301975250244

```

The issue is that the `count` variable is a `uint` (unsigned integer), and the subtraction operation can lead to an underflow if the `input` is greater than the current value of `count`. This can result in unexpected behavior and potentially be exploited by an attacker.

The `ERC20` and `Brute` contracts themselves do not have this vulnerability, but the `Brute` contract uses the `transferFrom` function from the `ERC20` contract, which could be vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow if the `ERC20` contract has similar issues.",arithmetic,3.0,702.0,6.0,0.7839663028717041

In Solidity, the `+=` operator can cause an integer overflow if the result of the addition is larger than the maximum value of a uint type (2^256 - 1). If an overflow occurs, the result will wrap around to 0, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the lock time.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflows and underflows. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath in the `increaseLockEE` function:

3. Line 33: `msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`

In Solidity version 0.4.21, the `+=` and `*=` operators do not perform overflow checks, which can lead to integer overflow and underflow issues. This can result in unexpected behavior and potential exploits.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflow and underflow. You can import the SafeMath library and use its functions for arithmetic operations.

Here's an updated version of the code with SafeMath:

The vulnerability lies in the `transfer` function of the `Token` contract, specifically in the lines:

```solidity
require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);

```

In Solidity, the `uint` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When subtracting `_value` from `balances[msg.sender]`, if the result is greater than the maximum value of a `uint` (2^256 - 1), it will wrap around to 0, causing an overflow. This can lead to an incorrect balance update and potentially allow a user to transfer more tokens than they actually have.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflows and underflows. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath in the `transfer` function:

The vulnerability lies in the `transferFrom` function of the `ERC20` contract, which is used in the `sendToken` function of the `Brute` contract. If the `_value` being transferred is large enough, it could cause an integer overflow when added to the recipient's balance.

In the `ERC20` contract, the `transferFrom` function is responsible for transferring tokens from one address to another. It subtracts the `_value` from the sender's balance and adds it to the recipient's balance.

This line allows the `msg.sender` to make a call to an external contract before the execution of the `withdrawFunds` function is complete. If the external contract being called is malicious and has a fallback function that calls back into the `withdrawFunds` function, it can potentially withdraw funds multiple times before the state of the `EtherStore` contract is updated.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function of the `Reentrance` contract. The issue is the same as in the first example: the contract allows external calls to be made before the state of the contract is updated.

In the `withdraw` function, the contract checks if the sender has enough balance and then calls `msg.sender.call.value(_amount)()`. This call sends Ether to the sender's address before the contract state is updated by subtracting the `_amount` from the sender's balance. If an attacker has a malicious contract that calls the `withdraw` function and then calls another function in the `Reentrance` contract, the attacker can drain the contract's funds.
right after the `msg.sender.call.value(_amount)()` call, the contract state is updated by subtracting `_amount` from the sender's balance.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the state (subtract `_amount` from the sender's balance) before making the external call. Here's an example of how the `withdraw` function can be modified to prevent the reentrancy attack:

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. In this case, the Collect function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because it allows the external contract to call the Put function before the balance is updated.

This will trigger the `airDrop()` function of the `ModifierEntrancy` contract, which transfers tokens to the attacker's address. The attacker's fallback function can then be called again, causing the `airDrop()` function to be called repeatedly, draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `airDrop()` function should be called after updating the state of the `attack` contract, or the `supportsToken()` function should be modified to prevent reentrancy.",reentrancy,3.0,756.0,6.0,0.9692046642303467

The vulnerability lies in the `sendToken` function of the `Brute` contract. When the `transferFrom` function of the `ERC20` contract is called, it allows for external calls to be made before the initial execution is complete. This can lead to reentrancy attacks, as seen in the `ReentrancyDAO` contract.

In the `sendToken` function, the `ERC20` contract is instantiated and the `transferFrom` function is called. If the `ERC20` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy, an attacker could create a malicious contract that calls the `transferFrom` function again before the initial call is complete, potentially draining funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `transferFrom` function should be called with the `transfer` function instead, which does not allow for external calls.

113,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `EtherBank` contract. The issue is the same as in the first example: the contract allows external calls to be made before the state of the contract is updated.

In the `withdrawBalance` function, the contract sends the entire balance to the `msg.sender` before updating the balance to zero. This allows a malicious contract to call the `withdrawBalance` function and then call another function in the `EtherBank` contract before the balance is updated to zero. This can lead to multiple withdrawals of the balance, causing the contract to lose funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the balance should be updated to zero before sending the funds. Here's an updated version of the `withdrawBalance` function:

```solidity

    userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;
    uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
    if (!(msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)())) { throw; }

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrancy_cross_function` contract. When the `withdrawBalance` function is called, it sends the entire balance of the user to the caller's address before updating the user's balance to zero. This allows a malicious contract to call the `transfer` function during the execution of the `withdrawBalance` function, potentially draining funds from the contract.

In the provided code, the `Brute` contract can exploit this vulnerability by calling the `transferFrom` function of the `ERC20` contract while the `withdrawBalance` function is still executing. This can lead to a reentrancy attack, where the malicious contract repeatedly calls the `transferFrom` function, draining funds from the `Reentrancy_cross_function` contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `withdrawBalance` function should update the user's balance to zero before sending the funds. This can be achieved by changing the order of the statements in the `withdrawBalance` function:

118,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrance` contract. The issue is that the contract allows external calls to be made before the state of the contract is updated. In this case, the `userBalance[msg.sender]` is set to 0 after the external call, but the state change is not reflected in the external call. This allows a malicious contract to call the `withdrawBalance` function multiple times before the balance is updated, leading to multiple withdrawals.

In the `Brute` contract, the `sendToken` function calls the `transferFrom` function of the `ERC20` contract, which in turn calls the `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrance` contract. This creates an opportunity for a reentrancy attack, as the `transferFrom` function can be called multiple times before the balance is updated in the `Reentrance` contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `withdrawBalance` function should update the `userBalance` before making the external call, or use a pattern like Checks-Effects-Interactions to ensure that the state is updated before external calls are made.",reentrancy,3.0,778.0,6.0,0.8495137691497803

The vulnerability lies in the `sendToken` function of the `Brute` contract. If an attacker has a malicious contract that calls the `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract during the execution of the `transferFrom` function, the attacker can repeatedly withdraw funds from the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract before the `transferFrom` function completes.

Here's a possible scenario:

1. The `sendToken` function is called with the address of the malicious contract.
2. The `transferFrom` function is called, and the `ERC20` token contract is instantiated.
3. The attacker's malicious contract calls the `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract.

This can lead to predictable or unfair outcomes in the contract's execution, especially in the payOut() function where the random number is used to determine if the payout should occur.

Additionally, the payOut() function relies on the difference between the current time (now) and the random number (rand) to determine if the payout should occur. Since the current time can be manipulated by miners, this can also lead to vulnerabilities in the contract's execution.

132,short addresses," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to short address attacks. The vulnerability lies in the `sendCoin` function, which uses the `address` type for the `to` parameter. The `address` type in Solidity is 20 bytes, which is the same size as an Ethereum address. However, when an address is used in a transaction, it is padded to 32 bytes. If an attacker uses a short address (less than 20 bytes) in a transaction, the EVM will pad it with zeros on the left, potentially leading to an incorrect address being used in the transaction.

In this case, the `sendCoin` function does not check the length of the `to` address, which makes it vulnerable to short address attacks. An attacker could exploit this by sending a transaction with a short address, causing the contract to transfer tokens to an unintended address.

To fix this vulnerability, the `to` parameter should be changed to the `address payable` type, which is 32 bytes and includes the 20-byte address and a 12-byte value. This ensures that the address is always padded to the correct length, preventing short address attacks.

```solidity
if(creditorAddresses.length>1500) {

```

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the `addCreditors` function, which adds 350 addresses to the `creditorAddresses` array in each call. Once the array reaches a length of 1501, the `emptyCreditors` function will be triggered, and the `creditorAddresses` array will be reset to an empty array. This will cause the `win` variable to be set to true, potentially disrupting the intended functionality of the contract.

In a denial of service attack, an attacker can repeatedly call the `addCreditors` function to keep the `creditorAddressees` array length above 1500, causing the `emptyCreditors` function to be called frequently and resetting the array. This can lead to a situation where the contract is unable to perform its intended function, effectively causing a denial of service.",denial of service,3.0,774.0,6.0,0.7725427150726318

The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the contract attempts to dynamically resize the `array` if `numElements` reaches the current length of the `array`.

In Solidity, arrays are fixed-size data structures, and their size cannot be changed once they are initialized. The line `array.length += 1;` is attempting to change the size of the array, which is not allowed and will result in a runtime error. This error will cause the transaction to revert, effectively denying service to the user who initiated the transaction.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should be modified to allocate enough space for the array before inserting elements, or use a dynamic array type that allows resizing, such as `uint[]`.",denial of service,3.0,702.0,6.0,0.8717329502105713

136,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function of the `Refunder` contract, specifically in the line:

```solidity

```

This line attempts to send the refund amount to each address in the `refundAddresses` array. If any of these addresses fail to accept the transaction (e.g., due to insufficient gas, or the address being a contract that reverts the transaction), the entire `refundAll` function will fail, and the transaction will not be completed. This can lead to a denial of service, as the function will not be able to complete the refunds for all addresses.

Additionally, the `ERC20` contract interface is not implemented in the provided code, which means that the `transferFrom` function is not actually defined. This could lead to a different type of vulnerability if the `Brute` contract tries to use the `ERC20` interface without the actual implementation being present.",denial of service,4.0,744.0,6.0,0.8241012096405029
137,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function of the `DosOneFunc` contract. An attacker can repeatedly call this function to fill the `listAddresses` array with their own address. Once the array reaches the limit of 1500 addresses, the function will reset the array to an empty array, effectively removing all previously stored addresses.

This can be used to disrupt the contract's functionality if other parts of the contract rely on the `listAddresses` array. For example, if the `listAddresses` array is used to store a whitelist of addresses that are allowed to perform certain actions, an attacker could repeatedly call the `ifillArray` function to remove all whitelisted addresses, effectively denying service to legitimate users.

To fix this vulnerability, you could implement a limit on the number of times the `ifillArray` function can be called by a single address or use a more secure method to manage the `listAddresses` array.",denial of service,3.0,742.0,6.0,0.791301965713501

The vulnerability lies in the `Brute` contract's `sendToken` function. If an attacker calls this function with a contract address that does not implement the `transferFrom` function correctly or has a malicious implementation, the `transferFrom` call will fail. This failure will cause the `sendToken` function to revert, which will consume all the gas provided for the transaction. Since the `sendToken` function is payable, it can be called with a large amount of gas, leading to a denial of service attack by exhausting the gas available to other transactions on the network.

To fix this vulnerability, the `Brute` contract should check if the `_contract` address implements the `ERC20` interface correctly before calling the `transferFrom` function.",denial of service,3.0,699.0,6.0,1.0368726253509521
