11,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function in the `MultiOwnable` contract.

The issue is that the `newOwner` function allows any user to become an owner by calling the function and passing their address as the `_owner` parameter. This means that any user can become an owner, even if they are not the root owner or an existing owner. This can lead to unauthorized users gaining control over the contract's functionality and potentially causing harm.

To fix this vulnerability, the `newOwner` function should be modified to only allow the root owner or existing owners to add new owners. This can be achieved by adding an additional check in the `newOwner` function to ensure that the user calling the function is either the root owner or an existing owner.",access control,3.0,697.0,6.0,0.87239670753479
12,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`.

This means that if the constructor is called multiple times, it could potentially overwrite the previous balance, leading to an incorrect balance being stored for that address.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` contract does not have any access control mechanisms in place, which means that anyone can call the constructor and potentially cause issues with the token's balances. This could be considered a vulnerability in terms of access control, as it allows unauthorized users to manipulate the token's balances.",access control,4.0,709.0,6.0,0.7968101501464844

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);

This line allows any user to withdraw their balance, which is correct. However, the issue arises when considering the `migrateTo` function:

```solidity
function migrateTo(address to) public {
    require(creator == msg.sender);
    to.transfer(this.balance);
}
```

In this function, the `creator` can transfer the entire contract balance to any address. This means that the `creator` has unrestricted access to the contract's funds, which is a significant access control vulnerability.

To fix this issue, the `migrateTo` function should be restricted to only allow the `creator` to transfer their own balance, not the entire contract balance. This can be achieved by adding an additional check in the `migrateTo` function to ensure that the `to` address is the `creator`'s address.",access control,3.0,740.0,6.0,0.9330739974975586
15,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being updated with the `totalSupply` before the constructor function has finished executing. This can lead to a situation where the `balanceOf` mapping is accessible and modifiable by other contracts or functions before the contract is fully initialized, potentially leading to an access control issue.

In Solidity, the constructor function is executed before the contract is deployed, and the contract's state variables are not yet fully initialized. In this case, the `balanceOf` mapping is being updated with the `totalSupply` value before the contract is fully deployed. This can lead to a situation where the `balanceOf` mapping is accessible and modifiable by other contracts or functions before the contract is fully initialized, potentially leading to an access control issue.

To fix this issue, the `balanceOf` mapping should be updated after the constructor function has finished executing, ensuring that the contract is fully initialized before the mapping is accessible and modifiable.",access control,3.0,754.0,6.0,0.9240453243255615

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. The `onlyowner` modifier checks if the `msg.sender` is equal to the `owner`, which is fine for basic access control. However, the issue arises with the `CustomToken` contract, which inherits from `BaseToken`. The constructor of `CustomToken` is marked as `public`, which means it can be called by any external account, not just the owner.

In this case, the `CustomToken` contract is deploying an instance of the `Missing` contract and setting the `owner` to a specific address. Since the constructor is public, any external account can deploy the `CustomToken` contract and effectively become the owner of the `Missing` contract. This bypasses the intended access control mechanism and exposes the `Missing` contract to potential misuse.

To fix this vulnerability, the constructor of the `CustomToken` contract should be marked as `internal` or `private`, ensuring that only the deploying account can set the `owner` of the `Missing` contract. Additionally, it is recommended to use the `msg.sender` instead of `tx.origin` for access control checks, as `tx.origin` is deprecated and can lead to other vulnerabilities.",access control,4.0,790.0,6.0,0.836122989654541

The vulnerability lies in the `changeOwner` function in the `Unprotected` contract. This function allows anyone to change the owner of the contract by simply calling it and passing the new owner's address as an argument. Since the `changeOwner` function is public and does not have any access control checks, it can be exploited by any user to change the ownership of the contract.

This is a serious issue because the owner of a contract has significant control over its functionality and state. An attacker could change the owner to themselves and then manipulate the contract's state or functionality to their advantage.

To fix this vulnerability, the `changeOwner` function should be made private and only callable by the current owner of the contract. This can be achieved by adding the `onlyowner` modifier to the `changeOwner` function, like this:

```solidity
function changeOwner(address _newOwner) public onlyowner {

This can lead to fail-opens and other unwanted outcomes if the return value of such low-level calls is not checked.

To fix this vulnerability, the developer should use the `call()` function with proper error checking, like this:

The vulnerability lies in the `IntegerOverflowMul` contract, specifically in the `run` function at line 17: `count *= input;`. This line of code is susceptible to integer overflow because it multiplies the `count` variable by the `input` without any checks for overflow.

In Solidity, when an integer overflow occurs, the result wraps around to the minimum value of the type. For example, if `count` is `2**256 - 1` and `input` is `2`, the result of the multiplication would be `0` instead of the expected `2**256`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially be exploited by attackers.

In Solidity, when assigning a value to a mapping, the value is implicitly converted to the key type. In this case, the `totalSupply` is a `uint256`, and the `balanceOf` mapping is indexed by an address (which is also a `uint256` in Solidity). When assigning the `totalSupply` to the `balanceOf` mapping, the value is implicitly converted to an address.

However, the `totalSupply` value is too large to be represented as an address. This can lead to an integer overflow, which can result in an incorrect balance being assigned to the address `0x3e5a7EEa0a1362baf285bc6e39b2ad0995c00dd`.

In this case, if `_secondsToIncrease` is large enough, the `lockTime` value could wrap around to zero, effectively resetting the lock time to zero and allowing the user to withdraw their funds immediately.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who sends a large `_secondsToIncrease` value to the `increaseLockTime` function, causing the `lockTime` value to overflow and reset to zero. This would allow the attacker to withdraw their funds before the intended lock time has passed.",arithmetic,3.0,708.0,6.0,0.9629518985748291

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the following lines:

1. Line 23: `require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`
2. Line 25: `balanceOf[msg.sender] += numTokens;`
3. Line 33: `msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`

In Solidity version 0.4.21, the `*` operator does not check for overflow or underflow. This means that if the result of the multiplication exceeds the maximum value of a uint256, it will wrap around to zero, leading to incorrect calculations and potentially allowing attackers to manipulate the contract's behavior.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflow and underflow. You can import the library and use its functions for multiplication and addition.

Here's an example of how to use SafeMath to fix the vulnerability:

```solidity

83,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `run` function of the `IntegerOverflowMultiTxMultiFuncFeasible` contract. Specifically, the line `count -= input;` can cause an underflow if the `input` is greater than the current value of `count`. In Solidity version 0.4.23, there is no built-in overflow or underflow checking, which means that if `count` is 1 and `input` is 2, the resulting `count` would be -1, which is not a valid state for a `uint256` type.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the state of the contract, potentially leading to loss of funds or other unintended consequences.",arithmetic,3.0,684.0,6.0,1.0702159404754639
84,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The line `balanceOf[0x3e5a7109e0a1362baf285bc6e39b2ad0995c00dd] = totalSupply;` is vulnerable to integer overflow.

In Solidity, when assigning a value to a mapping, the value is implicitly converted to the key type. In this case, the `totalSupply` is a `uint256`, and the `balanceOf` mapping is indexed by an address, which is also a `uint256`. When assigning the `totalSupply` to the `balanceOf` mapping, the `totalSupply` value is implicitly converted to an `address` type.

However, the `totalSupply` value is very large (1000000000000000000000000000), and when converting it to an `address` type, it can cause an integer overflow. This can lead to an incorrect balance being assigned to the address `0x3e5a7EEA0a1362baf285bc6e39b2ad0",arithmetic,3.0,775.0,6.0,0.9289684295654297

In Solidity, when assigning a value to a variable, if the value is larger than the maximum value that the variable can hold, it will wrap around to the minimum value. In this case, the `balanceOf` mapping is of type `uint256`, which can hold a maximum value of 2^256 - 1. The `totalSupply` is set to 1000000000000000000000000000, which is a very large number but still within the range of `uint256`.

However, the issue arises when the `balanceOf` mapping is accessed using the address `0x3e5a7109e0a1362baf285bc6e39b2ad0995c00dd`. This address is a 20-byte address",arithmetic,3.0,767.0,6.0,1.2095694541931152

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. This is because it uses Solidity version 0.4.23, which does not have built-in overflow checks. The operations in the functions `overflowaddtostate`, `overflowmultostate`, `underflowtostate`, `overflowlocalonly`, `overflowmulocalonly`, and `underflowlocalonly` can lead to integer overflow and underflow issues.",arithmetic,3.0,620.0,6.0,0.7649574279785156

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the same type of arithmetic overflow issue as the first example. The vulnerability lies in the `transfer` function, specifically in the lines:

```solidity
require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
```

In Solidity version 0.4.18, the `uint` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When subtracting `_value` from `balances[msg.sender]`, if the result is less than zero, it will wrap around to a very large positive number due to the nature of unsigned integer arithmetic. This can lead to an incorrect balance update and potentially allow the attacker to drain funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations, or upgrade to a newer Solidity version (0.8.x or above) that includes built-in overflow checks.",arithmetic,3.0,722.0,6.0,0.8243236541748047

The vulnerability lies in the `add` function of the `Overflow` contract. When the `value` parameter is added to `sellerBalance`, there is no check to ensure that the result does not overflow the maximum value that a uint type can hold. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploitation by attackers.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflows and underflows. Here's an example of how you can use SafeMath to fix the `add` function:

In Solidity, the `+=` operator can cause an integer overflow if the result of the addition is greater than the maximum value that can be stored in a `uint256` (which is 2^256 - 1). When an overflow occurs, the result wraps around to 0, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploits.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library provided by OpenZeppelin, which includes overflow-safe arithmetic operations. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath in the contract:

Miners have the ability to influence the block hash by choosing which transactions to include in a block and the nonce value. By carefully selecting transactions and nonce values, miners can predict the block hash and, consequently, the output of the `rand(uint max)` function. This predictability can be exploited by a malicious participant to gain an unfair advantage in the game.

This line allows the `msg.sender` to make a call to an external contract before the state of the `EtherBank` contract is updated. If the external contract is malicious and has a fallback function that calls the `withdrawBalance` function again, it can drain the funds from the `EtherBank` contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the state before making the external call, like this:

```solidity
userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;

The vulnerability lies in line 29:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the contract before the initial execution is complete. In this case, the Collect function is vulnerable to reentrancy because it allows the external contract to call the Put function before the balance is deducted.

An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the Collect function and then calls the Put function before the balance is deducted. This would result in the attacker being able to withdraw more funds than they should be able to, as the balance would not have been deducted yet.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern, where all checks and effects are performed before any external interactions. In this case, the balance should be deducted before the external call is made.

Here's an example of how the Collect function can be modified to prevent the reentrancy attack:

function Collect(uint _am)

This line allows the `msg.sender` to make a call to an external contract before the execution of the CashOut function is complete. If the external contract being called is malicious and has a fallback function that calls back into the CashOut function, it can potentially withdraw funds multiple times before the balance is updated, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests that you should first perform all checks and effects (updates to the state) before interacting with external contracts. In this case, you should first deduct the amount from the sender's balance and then perform the call to the external contract.

This can lead to multiple withdrawals being made in a single transaction, potentially draining the contract's funds.

This line checks if the current block timestamp is at least one minute after the last investment timestamp. However, miners have the ability to manipulate the block timestamp within a certain range (usually 15 seconds). This means that an attacker could potentially mine a block with a timestamp that is just under one minute after the last investment timestamp, bypassing the time check and triggering the resetInvestment function.

- Line 20: `pastBlockTime = now;`

These lines ensure that only one transaction per block can transfer the balance to the sender. However, miners have some leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred. An attacker can exploit this by mining a block with a timestamp just before the 15-second interval, causing the contract to transfer the funds to the attacker's address.

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to short address attacks. The vulnerability lies in the `sendCoin` function, where the `address` type is used without explicitly checking for the full length of the address. In Solidity, the `address` type is 20 bytes, but when passing an address to a function, it can be passed as a 160-bit (20-byte) value or a 20-byte value. If a shorter address is passed, it can lead to incorrect behavior and potential loss of funds.

To fix this issue, the `sendCoin` function should be updated to use the `address payable` type and explicitly check for the full length of the address:

```solidity
function sendCoin(address payable to, uint amount) returns(bool sufficient) {
    if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) return false;
    balances[msgEE.sender] -= amount;

Once this happens, the `emptyCreditors` function will be triggered, which clears the `creditorAddresses` array and sets the `win` variable to true. This can be exploited to disrupt the normal operation of the contract by repeatedly triggering the `emptyCreditors` function, effectively denying service to legitimate users.",denial of service,3.0,655.0,6.0,0.9335238933563232

The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the contract attempts to dynamically resize the `array` if `numElements` reaches the current length of the `array`.

In Solidity, arrays are fixed-size data structures, and their size cannot be changed after they are initialized. The line `array.length += 1;` is attempting to change the size of the array, which is not allowed in Solidity and will result in a runtime error. This error will cause the transaction to revert, effectively denying service to the user who called the `insertNnumbers` function.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should be modified to allocate enough space for the array before inserting elements, or use a dynamic array that can grow as needed.",denial of service,3.0,699.0,6.0,0.8522913455963135

The vulnerability lies in the same lines as the original code:

1. creditorAddresses = new address[](0);

These lines are executed when the function `lendGovernmentMoney` is called, and they reset the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays to empty arrays. This means that all the previously stored creditor addresses and amounts are lost, and the contract becomes unable to process any further transactions.

This vulnerability can be exploited by repeatedly calling the `lendGovernmentMoney` function, which will eventually lead to a denial of service as the contract becomes unable to process any further transactions.

This line attempts to send Ether to each address in the `refundAddresses` array. If any of the `send` operations fail, the entire transaction will revert, causing a denial of service. This is because the `require` statement will cause the function to revert if the `send` operation fails, and since the `refundAll` function is called in a loop, a single failure will prevent the remaining refunds from being processed.

Additionally, the `send` function itself is considered unsafe and deprecated in Solidity, as it does not provide enough information about the transaction's success or failure. It is recommended to use the `transfer` function instead, which reverts the entire transaction if the transfer fails, or the `call` function with proper error handling.",denial of service,3.0,735.0,6.0,0.7922024726867676
