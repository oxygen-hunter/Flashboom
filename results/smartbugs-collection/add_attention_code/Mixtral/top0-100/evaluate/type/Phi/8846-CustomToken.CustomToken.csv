11,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function (line 38) of the `MultiOwnable` contract. The function allows any user to become an owner by calling it, without any proper authorization checks. This means that any user can become an owner and gain control over the contract's functions that are restricted to owners only.

The `newOwner` function should be restricted to the root owner or the current owner only, but the current implementation allows any user to call it. This can lead to unauthorized access and control over the contract's functions, which can be exploited by attackers.

To fix this vulnerability, the `newOwner` function should be modified to include proper authorization checks, ensuring that only the root owner or the current owner can call it.",access control,3.0,695.0,6.0,0.8227949142456055

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the `msg.sender` check in the `DynamicPyramid` function. This function allows any user to call it and set the `creator` variable to their address. This means that any user can become the owner of the contract, which can lead to unauthorized control over the contract's functionality and funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `DynamicPyramid` function should only be callable by the original deployer of the contract or a designated admin address.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);
```

This line allows any user to withdraw their balance, which is correct. However, the issue arises when considering the `migrateTo` function:

```solidity
function migrateTo(address to) public {
    require(creator == msg.sender);
    to.transfer(this.balance);
}
```

In this function, the `creator` can transfer the entire contract balance to any address. This means that the `creator` has unrestricted access to the contract's funds, which is a significant access control vulnerability.

To fix this issue, the `migrateTo` function should be restricted to only allow the `creator` to transfer their own balance, not the entire contract balance. This can be achieved by adding an additional check in the `migrateTo` function to ensure that the `to` address is the same as the `creator` address.",access control,3.0,741.0,6.0,0.8021731376647949
15,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being updated with the `totalSupply` before the constructor has finished executing. This can lead to a situation where the `balanceOf` mapping is accessible and modifiable by other contracts or functions before the contract is fully initialized, potentially leading to an access control issue.

In Solidity, the constructor function is executed before the contract is deployed, and the contract's state variables are not yet fully initialized. In this case, the `balanceOf` mapping is being updated with the `totalSupply` value before the contract is fully deployed. This can lead to a situation where the `balanceOf` mapping is accessible and modifiable by other contracts or functions before the contract is fully initialized, potentially leading to an access control issue.

To fix this issue, the `balanceOf` mapping should be updated after the constructor function has finished executing, ensuring that the contract is fully initialized before the mapping is accessible and modifiable.",access control,3.0,753.0,6.0,0.7821869850158691

19,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. The `onlyowner` modifier checks if the `msg.sender` is equal to the `owner`, which is fine for basic access control. However, the issue arises with the `CustomToken` contract, which inherits from `BaseToken`. The constructor of `CustomToken` is marked as `public`, which means it can be called by any external account, not just the owner.

When the `CustomToken` contract is deployed, the `Constructor` function of the `CustomToken` contract is called, which sets the `totalSupply` and other token details. However, since the `Constructor` function is public, any external account can deploy the `CustomToken` contract, effectively bypassing the `onlyowner` modifier in the `Missing` contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `CustomToken` contract's constructor should be marked as `internal` or `private` to prevent external accounts from deploying it. Additionally, the `Missing` contract should be updated to use the recommended access control mechanism, such as using the `ownerOf` function from the `ERC721` or `ERC20` standard, to check if the caller is the owner of the contract.",access control,3.0,790.0,6.0,0.9089672565460205

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `msg.sender` in the `initWallet` function without proper access control. This allows any user to set the `creator` address, which is then used as a guard in the `migrateTo` function to prevent the creator from transferring the contract's balance to another address.

The contract assigns the entire token supply to a single address (0xfa1c8d83879818b545f6edf1264201ed5710293f) during deployment. This means that only the deployer of the contract has control over the entire token supply, which is a significant access control issue.

An attacker could exploit this by deploying a malicious contract that interacts with the `CustomToken` contract and potentially manipulates the token supply or other sensitive data.

31,unchecked low level calls," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to unchecked low-level calls.

The vulnerability lies in the `transfer` function of the `airPort` contract, which uses the `call` low-level function to transfer tokens from one address to another. The `call` function is used without checking its return value, which can lead to fail-open situations and other unwanted outcomes.

In the provided code, the `transfer` function in the `airPort` contract calls the `call` function on the `caddress` with the `id`, `from`, `_tos[i]`, and `v` parameters. However, it does not check the return value of the `call` function, which can be either `true` or `false`. If the `call` function returns `false`, it means that the transaction has failed, but the code will continue to execute without handling the failure.

To fix this vulnerability, the `transfer` function should check the return value of the `call` function and handle the failure accordingly. Here's an example of how the `transfer` function can be modified to check the return value of the `call` function:

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the `transfer` or `send` function instead of the low-level `call` function. These functions will revert the transaction if the transfer fails, providing better security.

Here's an updated version of the `Command` function using the `transfer` function:

```solidity
function Command(address adr, bytes data) public payable {
    require(msg.sender == Owner);
    (bool success, ) = adr.call{value: msg.value}(data);
    require(success, ""Call failed"");

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to unchecked low-level calls. The vulnerability lies in the `sendMoney` function, specifically in line 33: `_target.call.value(_value)(_data);`. This line uses the low-level `call.value` function to send Ether and potentially execute arbitrary code on the `_target` address. If `_data` contains malicious code and `_target` is controlled by an attacker, the attacker could exploit this to drain funds or perform other unauthorized actions.

The issue arises because the `call.value` function does not revert the transaction if the call fails. Instead, it returns a boolean value indicating success or failure. If the return value is not checked, the transaction will continue, potentially leading to fail-open scenarios and other unwanted outcomes.

To fix this vulnerability, the `sendMoney` function should be modified to check the return value of the `call.value` function and revert the transaction if the call fails. Here's an example of how to fix the vulnerability:

```solidity
function sendMoney(address _target, uint _value, bytes _data) public onlyOwner {
    (bool success, ) = _target.call.value(_value)(_rightData);
    require(success, ""Call failed"");

The vulnerability lies in the line 19 where the low-level call function is used without checking its return value:

```solidity
caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v[i]*1000000000000000000);
```

This line is attempting to call the `transferFrom` function on the `caddress` contract. However, the return value of the `call` function is not being checked. If the `transferFrom` function fails for any reason, the code will continue to execute without reverting the transaction. This can lead to fail-open scenarios and other unwanted outcomes.

To fix this vulnerability, the return value of the `call` function should be checked, and the transaction should be reverted if the call fails:

```solidity
(bool success, ) = caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v[i]*1000000000000000000);

In the `demo` contract, the line `caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v);` is a low-level call that sends Ether from the `from` address to the `_tos[i]` address. If this call fails, it will not revert the transaction, and the code will continue to execute. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.

In the `CustomToken` contract, the `transfer` function calls the `transfer` function of the `demo` contract, which contains the unchecked low-level call. This makes the `CustomToken` contract vulnerable to the same issue.

In Solidity, when assigning a value to a variable, if the value is larger than the maximum value that the variable can hold, it will wrap around to the minimum value. In this case, the `uint256` type can hold values up to 2^256 - 1. If the `totalSupply` value is larger than this maximum value, the assignment will result in an integer overflow, causing the balance to be set to an incorrect value.

The line `count -= input;` can cause an underflow if the `input` is greater than the current value of `count`. In Solidity version 0.4.23, there is no built-in overflow or underflow checking, which means that if `count` is 1 and `input` is 2, the resulting `count` would be -1, which is not a valid value for a `uint256` type.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The line `balanceOf[0xfa1c8d83879818b545f6edf1264201ed5710293f] = totalSupply;` is vulnerable to integer overflow.

In Solidity, when assigning a value to a mapping, the value is implicitly converted to the key type. In this case, the `balanceOf` mapping has a `uint256` type, and `totalSupply` is also a `uint256`. When assigning `totalSupply` to the `balanceOf` mapping, the value is implicitly converted to `uint256`.

However, the `totalSupply` value is initialized with a literal value of `5000000000000000000000000000`, which is a `uint256` literal. When this value is assigned to the `balanceOf` mapping, it is implicitly converted to `uint256`.

The line `balanceOf[0xfa1c8d83879818b545f6edf1264201ed5710293f] = totalSupply;` assigns the `totalSupply` to the `balanceOf` mapping for the address `0xfa1c8d83879818b545f6edf1264201ed5710293f`.

The issue arises when the `totalSupply` value is too large to be represented by the `uint256` data type. In this case, the `totalSupply` is set to `5000000000000000000000000000`, which is a very large number. If the `totalSupply` value exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by `uint256`, it will cause an integer overflow, leading to incorrect calculations and potentially allowing attackers to manipulate the contract's behavior.

86,arithmetic," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow due to the use of unsigned integer operations without proper checks. In Solidity, when an operation results in a value that exceeds the maximum value of the data type, it wraps around to zero (overflow). Similarly, when a subtraction results in a negative value, it wraps around to the maximum value of the data type (underflow). These behaviors can lead to unexpected and potentially exploitable outcomes.

For example, in the `overflowaddtostate` function, if the `input` is large enough, adding it to `count` could cause an overflow, wrapping the result to zero. Similarly, in the `overflowmultostate` function, multiplying `count` by `input` could also cause an overflow. The `underflowtostate` function could cause an underflow if `input` is larger than `count`.

The local-only functions (`overflowlocalonly`, `overflowmulocalonly`, and `underflowlocalonly`) are also vulnerable, as they perform the same operations without affecting the state variables. However, these functions could still be used maliciously in combination with other contracts or functions.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, Solidity introduced the `SafeMath` library in version 0.8.0, which provides arithmetic operations with built-in overflow and underflow",arithmetic,3.0,801.0,6.0,0.9105620384216309

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the same type of arithmetic overflow issue as the first contract. The vulnerability lies in the `transfer` function, specifically in the lines:

```solidity
require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
```

In Solidity version 0.4.18, the `uint` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When subtracting `_value` from `balances[msg.sender]`, if the result is less than zero, it will wrap around to a very large positive number due to the nature of unsigned integer arithmetic. This can lead to an incorrect balance update and potentially allow the attacker to drain funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations, or upgrade to a newer Solidity version (0.8.x or above) that includes built-in overflow checks.",arithmetic,3.0,722.0,6.0,1.3286163806915283

In Solidity, the `uint256` type is an unsigned integer with a maximum value of 2^256 - 1. When performing arithmetic operations, if the result exceeds this maximum value, it will wrap around to zero. In this case, the `totalSupply` is set to 5000000000000000000000000000, which is a very large number but still within the range of `uint256`. However, the issue arises when the `balanceOf` mapping is updated with this value.

The `balanceOf` mapping is a `mapping` data structure, which is essentially a hash table. When assigning a value to a key that does not exist in the mapping, the key is automatically created with the assigned value. In this case, the key `0xfa1c8d8387",arithmetic,3.0,768.0,6.0,0.8019604682922363

This can lead to incorrect balances and potential exploits.

The vulnerability lies in the line `balanceOf[_to] += _value;` in the `transfer` function of the `IntegerOverflowAdd` contract. In Solidity version 0.4.10, the `+=` operator does not check for overflows, which can lead to unexpected results and potential exploits.

In this specific case, if the balance of the `_to` address is close to the maximum value of a uint256 (2^256 - 1), adding `_value` to it could cause an overflow, resulting in a smaller number than expected. This could lead to incorrect balances and potential exploits, such as transferring more tokens than intended.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflows. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath in the `transfer` function:

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (in this case, the `msg.sender`) and sending Ether to it before updating the balance of the `acc` account. This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `Collect` function before the balance update is completed, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the balance update should be done before the external call, and the contract should use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. Here's an example of how the `Collect` function can be modified to avoid the reentrancy attack:

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (the msg.sender) and sending Ether to it before updating the balance. This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `Collect` function before the balance update is executed, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance before sending Ether to the external contract. This can be done by moving the line `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;` before the external call.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the resetInvestment function, specifically in the line:

if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp+ONE_MINUTE)

This condition checks if the current block timestamp is at least one minute after the last investment timestamp. However, miners have the ability to manipulate the block timestamp within a certain range (usually 15 seconds). An attacker can exploit this by mining a block with a timestamp that is just slightly more than one minute after the last investment timestamp, thus bypassing the condition and triggering the resetInvestment function.

This vulnerability allows the attacker to reset the jackpot and steal the funds from the last investor, as well as the owner's balance.",time manipulation,3.0,672.0,6.0,0.8850610256195068
130,time manipulation," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the logic that checks if the current time (`now`) is not equal to the `pastBlockTime` and then updates `pastBlockTime` to the current time. This logic is intended to ensure that only one transaction per block can execute the `if(now % 15 == 0)` condition. However, miners have some leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, which can be exploited to manipulate the outcome of the contract's logic.

In this case, a miner could potentially mine a block with a timestamp that is a multiple of 15 seconds after the previous block's timestamp, causing the `if(now % 15 == 0)` condition to be true and the contract to transfer funds to the `msg.sender`. This could be done multiple times within a short period, allowing the miner to repeatedly transfer funds from the contract.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should use a more reliable source of time or implement additional checks to prevent multiple transfers within a short time frame.",time manipulation,3.0,746.0,6.0,0.8957834243774414
131,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same line as the first contract, line 43:

An attacker with control over the mining process could manipulate the block timestamp to influence the outcome of the random number generation, potentially affecting the distribution of winnings in the EtherLotto contract.",time manipulation,3.0,626.0,6.0,0.7459685802459717
132,short addresses," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to short address attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `sendCoin` function handles the `to` address. The `to` address is passed as a parameter without type checking or validation, which can lead to short address attacks if the address is not properly padded.

In Ethereum, addresses are 20-byte (160-bit) values, but they can be represented in different formats, such as hexadecimal or base58. If a client incorrectly pads the address, it can lead to a short address attack, where an attacker can exploit the vulnerability to send Ether to an unintended recipient.

To fix this vulnerability, the `sendCoin` function should validate the `to` address and ensure it is properly padded before processing the transaction. Additionally, it is recommended to use the `address` type for the `to` parameter, which automatically handles the address padding.

Here's an updated version of the `sendCoin` function with address validation:

```solidity
function sendCoin(address to, uint amount) returns(bool sufficient) {
    if (to == address(0)) throw; // Reject zero address
    if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) return false;

133,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. An attacker can repeatedly call the `addCreditors` function to fill the `creditorAddresses` array with their own address. Once the array reaches a length of 1500, the `emptyCreditors` function will be triggered, which clears the entire array and sets the `win` variable to true. This can be exploited to disrupt the contract's intended functionality by repeatedly adding and removing creditors, effectively causing a DoS condition.",denial of service,3.0,648.0,6.0,0.7795169353485107
134,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles the dynamic resizing of the `array` when inserting elements. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the contract checks if `numElements` is equal to `array.length` and then increments `array.length` by 1.

In Solidity, arrays are dynamic, and their size can be changed during runtime. However, the `array.length` property is not mutable and cannot be directly assigned a new value. The line `array.length += 1;` is attempting to modify a read-only property, which will result in a runtime error and revert the transaction. This can be exploited by an attacker by repeatedly calling the `insertNnumbers` function with a large number of elements, causing the contract to revert and potentially exhaust the gas limit of the calling transaction.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use the `push` method to add elements to the array, which automatically resizes the array as needed. Here's an updated version of the `insertNnumbers` function:

```solidity
function insertNnumbers(uint value, uint numbers) public {
    for (uint i = 0; i < numbers; i++) {
        array.push(value);

135,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack.

The vulnerability lies in the way the contract handles the arrays `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts`. When the function `lendGovernmentMoney` is called, and the condition `lastTimeOfNewCredit + TWELVE_HOURS < block.timestamp` is met, the contract resets the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays by reinitializing them with a new array of length 0. This effectively removes all the stored creditor addresses and amounts, which can be exploited by repeatedly calling the `lendGovernmentMoney` function to keep the contract in a state where no creditor can be paid out.

An attacker can repeatedly call the `lendGovernmentMoney` function with a small amount of ether, causing the contract to continuously reset the arrays and preventing any creditor from being paid out. This can lead to a denial of service, as the contract will be stuck in a loop and unable to process any legitimate transactions.",denial of service,3.0,733.0,6.0,0.824476957321167

```

This line attempts to send Ether to each address in the `refundAddresses` array. If any of the `send` operations fail, the entire `refundAll` function will fail and roll back all previous transactions, including the successful ones. This can be exploited by an attacker who can control one of the addresses in the `refundAddresses` array, causing the function to fail and preventing legitimate refunds from being processed.",denial of service,3.0,666.0,6.0,0.8097007274627686

An attacker can repeatedly call this function to fill the `listAddresses` array with their own address. Once the array reaches its maximum size of 1500 addresses, the function will clear the array, but the attacker can keep calling the function to keep the contract busy and potentially disrupt its normal operation.

This can be considered a DoS attack because it can prevent legitimate users from interacting with the contract or cause the contract to consume excessive resources, leading to performance issues or even making the contract unresponsive.",denial of service,3.0,671.0,6.0,0.8107175827026367

This line attempts to send the current bid amount to the current frontrunner. If the current frontrunner's address is a contract that does not have a fallback function or if the fallback function is not implemented correctly, the transaction will fail, and the contract will revert.
