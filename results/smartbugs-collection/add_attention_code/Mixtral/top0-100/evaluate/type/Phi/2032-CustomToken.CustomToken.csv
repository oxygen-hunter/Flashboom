The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. Although it is not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, the vulnerability is common in Solidity contracts that use `tx.origin` to validate callers. This can lead to access control bypasses, as attackers can use lower-level calls to execute functions as if they were the original transaction initiator.",access control,3.0,611.0,6.0,0.8531584739685059
12,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, which inherits from the `BaseToken` contract. The constructor of `CustomToken` assigns the entire token supply to a single address (0x696423542f85B50fF3CA396A317De3abCb82f1c2) and then emits a `Transfer` event to itself. This means that the single address now has full control over the token supply.

The `CustomToken` contract does not have any access control mechanisms in place to prevent unauthorized access to its functions. This allows anyone to call the functions of the `CustomToken` contract, including the `transfer` function, which can be used to manipulate the token balances.

To fix this vulnerability, you should implement access control mechanisms in the `CustomToken` contract, such as using the `onlyowner` modifier to restrict access to certain functions. Additionally, you should consider using a more secure way to distribute the token supply, such as using a distribution contract or airdrop mechanism.",access control,3.0,751.0,6.0,0.8941740989685059

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `addPayout` function, where the `creator` address is not checked before sending Ether to the `Participant` addresses. This means that any user can call the `addPayout` function and send Ether to the `Participant` addresses, potentially draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `addPayout` function should be modified to include a modifier that checks if the caller is the `creator` before executing the function. This can be done by adding a `creatorOnly` modifier and applying it to the `addPayout` function, similar to how the `onlyOwner` modifier is used in the `collectAllFees` function.

Here's an example of how the `addPayout` function can be modified to include the `creatorOnly` modifier:

```solidity
modifier creatorOnly {
    require(msg.sender == creator);
    _;
}

function addPayout(uint _fee) creatorOnly private {

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function, specifically in line 20:

```solidity

```

This line allows the `msg.sender` to withdraw an amount equal to their current balance. However, this can be exploited by a malicious user who can call the `deposit` function with a large amount of Ether, effectively draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should enforce a maximum withdrawal limit or require an additional authorization mechanism to prevent unauthorized withdrawals.",access control,3.0,647.0,6.0,0.8906781673431396
15,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being accessed and modified before the contract is fully deployed and before the constructor has finished executing. This can lead to an incorrect initial balance being set for the owner, which is a form of reentrancy attack.

In the `CustomToken` constructor, the `balanceOf` mapping is accessed with the owner's address (`0x696423542f85B50fF3CA396A317De3abCb82f1c2`) and assigned the `totalSupply` value. However, if another contract calls the `CustomToken` constructor during its execution, the `balanceOf` mapping may not have been fully initialized yet, leading to an incorrect balance being set for the owner.

To fix this vulnerability, the `CustomToken` constructor should be modified to ensure that the `balanceOf` mapping is fully initialized before accessing or modifying it. One way to do this is by using a separate function to initialize the `balanceOf` mapping and then calling that function from the constructor.",access control,2.0,770.0,6.0,2.4054818153381348

19,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being updated with the `totalSupply` before the constructor function has finished executing. This can lead to a situation where the `balanceOf` mapping is accessible and modifiable by other contracts or functions before the contract is fully initialized, potentially leading to an incorrect or insecure state.

In Solidity, the constructor function is executed before the contract is deployed, and the state variables are not yet fully initialized. In this case, the `balanceOf` mapping is being updated with the `totalSupply` value before the contract is fully deployed. This can lead to a situation where the `balanceOf` mapping is accessible and modifiable by other contracts or functions before the contract is fully initialized, potentially leading to an incorrect or insecure state.

To fix this issue, the `CustomToken` constructor should be modified to ensure that the `balanceOf` mapping is only updated after the contract is fully deployed and initialized.

21,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the access control issue present in the `sendTo` function of the `MyContract` contract. The vulnerability lies in line 20: `require(tx.origin == owner);`. This line uses `tx.origin` to check if the caller of the function is the owner of the contract. However, `tx.origin` is considered deprecated and unreliable for access control in Solidity, as it can be easily spoofed by malicious contracts.

A better approach would be to use a modifier to check if the caller is the owner, like this:

```solidity

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `refund` function, which uses `msg.sender.transfer(balances[msg.sender]);` to send the balance back to the caller. This can be exploited by an attacker who is not the intended recipient of the refund.

In Solidity, `msg.sender` is the address that is currently calling the contract. In the context of the `refund` function, `msg.sender` is the address that initiated the refund transaction. However, this does not necessarily mean that the address is authorized to receive the refund. An attacker could call the `refund` function and receive the funds intended for the original owner of the wallet.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should verify that the address calling the `refund` function is authorized to receive the refund. This can be done by adding an access control mechanism, such as a modifier or a role-based access control system, to ensure that only authorized addresses can call the `refund` function.",access control,3.0,734.0,6.0,0.8176121711730957
23,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues.

The constructor function assigns the entire token supply to a single address (0x696423542f85B50fF3CA396A317De3abCb82f1c2), which is a hardcoded address. This means that only the owner of this address can access and transfer the tokens, and no other users can interact with the contract or transfer tokens.

This is a form of access control vulnerability because it restricts the functionality of the contract to a single address, making it difficult for other users to interact with the contract and potentially leading to centralization of control.

This function allows anyone to change the owner of the contract by calling it with the new owner's address as an argument. Since the `changeOwner` function is public and does not have any access control checks, it can be exploited by any user to change the ownership of the contract.

This can lead to various issues, such as unauthorized access to sensitive data, manipulation of contract logic, or even theft of funds if the contract holds any. To fix this vulnerability, the `changeOwner` function should be modified to include access control checks, ensuring that only the current owner or a designated authority can change the ownership of the contract.",access control,3.0,682.0,6.0,0.8265306949615479

The vulnerability lies in the `add` function of the `Overflow_Add` contract. In Solidity 0.4.25, the `+=` operator does not check for overflows or underflows. If the result of the addition exceeds the maximum value of a uint256 (2^256 - 1), it will wrap around to 0, leading to an incorrect balance.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflows and underflows. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath in the `Overflow_Add` contract:

```solidity

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function. The line `balanceOf[0x696423542f85B50fF3CA396A317De3abCb82f1c2] = totalSupply;` is vulnerable to integer overflow.

In Solidity, the `mapping` data structure is initialized with a default value of 0. When assigning the `totalSupply` to the `balanceOf` of the address `0x696423542f85B50fF3CA396A317De3abCb82f1c2`, the value of `totalSupply` is added to the existing value of `balanceOf[0x696423542f85B50fF3CA396A317De3abCb82f1c2]`, which is 0.

However, if the `totalSupply` is too large, it can cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect balance value. This can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the balance of the token, potentially leading to theft or denial of service.

The vulnerability lies in the `increaseLockTime` function, where the lock time for an address is increased by a certain number of seconds. If the `_secondsToIncrease` value is large enough, it could cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect lock time value. This could potentially allow a user to withdraw funds before the intended lock time has passed.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a function that checks for overflows, such as `SafeMath.add` from the OpenZeppelin library, or implement a custom overflow-checking function.",arithmetic,3.0,654.0,6.0,0.7699055671691895

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the following lines:

1. Line 23: `require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`
2. Line 25: `balanceOf[msg.sender] += numTokens;`
3. Line 33: `msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`

In Solidity version 0.4.21, the `uint256` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When an arithmetic operation results in a value that exceeds the maximum value representable by `uint2048`, it will wrap around to zero, causing an integer overflow. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities, such as allowing a user to buy or sell more tokens than they should be able to.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the SafeMath library provided by OpenZeppelin, which includes functions that check for overflow and underflow conditions. You can also upgrade to a newer version of Solidity (0.8.x or above) that has built-in overflow checks.",arithmetic,3.0,751.0,6.0,0.8789057731628418

The vulnerability lies in the `run` function of the `IntegerOverflowMultiTxMultiFuncFeasible` contract. The line `count -= input;` can cause an underflow if the `input` is greater than the current value of `count`. In Solidity version 0.4.23, there is no built-in overflow or underflow checking, which makes the contract susceptible to this issue.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by calling the `run` function with a large `input` value, causing the `count` variable to underflow and potentially leading to unexpected behavior or even loss of funds.",arithmetic,3.0,664.0,6.0,0.8499629497528076

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The line `balanceOf[0x696423542f85B50fF3CA396A317De3abCb82f1c2] = totalSupply;` is vulnerable to integer overflow.

In Solidity, the `mapping` data structure is initialized with a default value of 0. When assigning a value to a previously uninitialized address in the `balanceOf` mapping, the assignment operation may cause an integer overflow. In this case, the `totalSupply` is a very large number, and assigning it to an uninitialized address in the `balanceOf` mapping may cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect balance value.

To fix this vulnerability, you can initialize the `balanceOf` mapping with a default value of 0 for all addresses before assigning the `totalSupply` to the specific address. Here's an updated version of the `CustomToken` contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0right.4.19;

contract BaseToken {

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the `CustomToken()` constructor function. The line `balanceOf[0x696423542f85B50fF3CA396A317De3abCb82f1c2] = totalSupply;` is vulnerable to integer overflow.

In Solidity, the `uint256` type is an unsigned integer with a maximum value of 2^256 - 1. When assigning the `totalSupply` to the `balanceOf` mapping, if the `totalSupply` value is greater than the maximum value of `uint2EE6`, it will cause an integer overflow.

In this case, the `totalSupply` is set to 1000000000000000000000000000 (1e23), which is within the range of `uint256`. However, if the `totalSupply` value were to be increased beyond the maximum value of `uint256`, it would cause an integer overflow and potentially lead to incorrect balances being assigned.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. This is because it uses Solidity version 0.4.23, which does not have built-in overflow checks. The operations in the functions `overflowaddtostate`, `overflowmultostate`, `underflowtostate`, `overflowlocalonly`, `overflowmulocalonly`, and `underflowlocalonly` can lead to integer overflow and underflow issues.",arithmetic,3.0,620.0,6.0,0.7838046550750732
87,arithmetic," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the `transfer` function, specifically in the lines where the sender's balance is decremented and the receiver's balance is incremented.

In Solidity version 0.4.18, the `uint` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When subtracting `_value` from `balances[msg.sender]`, if the sender's balance is less than `_value`, the result will wrap around to a very large number due to the lack of overflow checks. This can lead to an incorrect balance update and potentially allow the sender to transfer more tokens than they actually have.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflow and underflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `IntegerOverflowAdd` contract, specifically in the `run` function:

```solidity
function run(uint256 input) public {
    count += input;

```

In Solidity, the `+=` operator can cause an integer overflow if the result of the addition exceeds the maximum value of a uint256 (2^256 - 1). When an overflow occurs, the result wraps around to 0, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploits.

In the context of a smart contract, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large enough input value to the `run` function, causing the `count` variable to overflow and wrap around to 0. This could potentially disrupt the intended functionality of the contract and lead to unintended consequences.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin, which provides safe arithmetic operations that check for overflows and underflows. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath to fix the vulnerability:

The vulnerability lies in the `add` function of the `Overflow` contract. When the `value` parameter is added to `sellerBalance`, there is no check to ensure that the result does not overflow the maximum value of a uint type. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploitation by attackers.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflow and underflow. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath to fix the vulnerability:

This makes the randomness used in the chooseWinner function predictable and potentially exploitable by a miner or a user with enough knowledge and resources.

Additionally, the use of block.difficulty as a seed for randomness is also not recommended, as it can be influenced by miners and is not a truly random value.

The vulnerability lies in the randomness generation function `rand(uint max)`. The issue is that the function uses the block hash of the previous block to generate a pseudo-random number. This method is predictable to some extent because miners have some control over the block hash by choosing the nonce during the mining process. An attacker with sufficient resources could potentially predict or influence the block hash, thus affecting the outcome of the `rand` function.

Additionally, the use of a constant factor and the division by the maximum value in the `rand` function can lead to a limited and predictable range of random numbers, which could be exploited by an attacker who can observe the blockchain and the contract's behavior over time.

The `block.blockhash(block.number - 1)` function returns the hash of the previous block, which is predictable and can be known by miners or anyone with access to the blockchain data. The `now` variable is also predictable as it represents the current timestamp. Combining these two predictable values and hashing them with `keccak256` does not provide a secure source of randomness.

If an attacker uses a short address (less than 20 bytes), the contract might interpret it as a different address, leading to funds being sent to an unintended recipient.

To fix this issue, the `sendCoin` function should explicitly check the length of the `to` address and reject any short addresses:

Once this threshold is reached, the `emptyCreditors` function will be triggered, which clears the entire `creditorAddresses` array. This can be done repeatedly, causing the contract to be unable to process legitimate transactions or functions that rely on the `creditorAddresses` array, effectively denying service to legitimate users.",denial of service,3.0,655.0,6.0,0.8118135929107666

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles the dynamic array `array`. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the array is being resized:

    if(numElements == array.length) {
        array.length += 1;
    }

The issue is that Solidity does not allow resizing an array by directly modifying its length property. The line `array.length += 1;` is not valid Solidity code and will result in a compilation error. However, the intention behind this line is to resize the array when it reaches its current length.

The correct way to resize an array in Solidity is to use the `push()` function, which appends an element to the end of the array and automatically resizes it if necessary. The vulnerability arises because the code attempts to resize the array in a way that is not supported by Solidity, which can lead to a Denial of Service attack if the contract is called with a large number of elements to insert.

This line attempts to send Ether to each address in the `refundAddresses` array. If any of the addresses in the array is a contract that has a fallback function that consumes a significant amount of gas, it could potentially cause the transaction to fail due to insufficient gas. Since the `refundAll` function is iterating over all addresses in the array, a single failure would cause the entire function to fail, preventing the refunds from being sent to the other addresses.

Additionally, if any of the addresses in the `refundAddresses` array is a contract that has a fallback function that deliberately consumes a large amount of gas or causes a delay, it could also lead to a denial of service attack.
