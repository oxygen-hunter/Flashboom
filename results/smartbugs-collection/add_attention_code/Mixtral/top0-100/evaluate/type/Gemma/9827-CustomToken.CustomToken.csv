The `Command` function in the `Pie` contract allows arbitrary code execution by calling the target address with the provided data and value. This is a classic example of a reentrancy vulnerability. 

Here's why:

* **Unrestricted Execution:** The `Command` function doesn't have any checks to prevent malicious actors from calling it repeatedly.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `Command` multiple times, potentially draining funds from the contract.

The `send` function in Solidity is a low-level function that can be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
 
The vulnerability lies in line 110:             msg.sender.send(valuePaid);
 
The vulnerability lies in line 118:             msg.sender.send(excessPaid);

These lines call the `send` function, which can be exploited by an attacker to drain funds from the contract. 
 
Here's why:
 
* **Reentrancy:** An attacker can call `send` repeatedly within a loop, potentially draining funds from the contract. 
* **Lack of Error Handling:** The `send` function doesn't handle errors gracefully, so it doesn't propagate errors or revert the transaction.

The `callnotchecked` function in the `ReturnValue` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  The `callnotchecked` function directly calls the target contract (`callee.call()`) without any checks or safeguards. This means an attacker could potentially call the function multiple times in rapid succession, leading to a reentrancy attack. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `callnotchecked` function doesn't handle the potential for the target contract to execute in a way that could be exploited. 
* **Potential for Loss:**  The attacker could potentially drain funds from the contract if the target contract is vulnerable to reentrancy.
