The code has several vulnerabilities related to the `send` function.  Here's why:

* **`msg.sender.send(valuePaid)`:** This line sends the `valuePaid` directly to the `msg.sender` without any checks. This means that if the `valuePaid` is not enough to cover the cost of the transaction, the contract will fail.
* **`msg.sender.send(excessPaid)`:** This line sends the `excessPaid` directly to the `msg.sender` without any checks. This means that if the `excessPaid` is not enough to cover the cost of the transaction, the contract will fail.
* **`currentMonarch.etherAddress.send(compensation)`:** This line sends the `compensation` directly to the `currentMonarch.etherAddress` without any checks. This means that if the `compensation` is not enough to cover the cost of the transaction, the contract will fail.
