The `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  The `multisend` function calls the `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function for each destination address.  This means that an attacker could potentially call the `multisend` function multiple times, each time before the previous one has finished. 
* **Unprotected Transfers:** The `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function is not designed to handle reentrancy.  This means that an attacker could potentially drain the contract's funds.
