The `multisend` function in the `QuantumpayAirdropper` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  The `multisend` function calls the `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function for each destination address.  This means that an attacker could potentially call the `multisend` function multiple times, each time before the previous one has finished. 
* **Potential for Loss:**  This could lead to a situation where the attacker repeatedly calls the `transfer` function, draining the contract's funds.

The `multisend` function in the `QuantumpayAirdropper` contract uses the `ERC20` contract's transfer function to send tokens to multiple addresses.  This function is vulnerable to integer overflows and underflows because it doesn't check the values of the `values` array before sending them to the `ERC20` contract. If the values are too large, they could overflow the `uint256` data type, leading to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.
