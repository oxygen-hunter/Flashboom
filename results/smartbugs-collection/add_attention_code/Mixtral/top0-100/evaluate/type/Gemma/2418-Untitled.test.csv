* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This call allows an attacker to potentially call the `Collect` function repeatedly, draining the contract's funds.

* **Reentrancy:** This creates a reentrancy vulnerability because the contract's state can be altered in the middle of its execution.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled External Calls:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls an external address (`_addr`) using `_addr.call.value(_wei)`. This means the contract doesn't know the outcome of the external call.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time before the previous one has finished. This creates a loop where the contract keeps trying to execute the external call, potentially draining funds.
