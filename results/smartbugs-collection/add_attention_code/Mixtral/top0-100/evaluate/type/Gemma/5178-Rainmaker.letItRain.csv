* **Denial of Service:**  The contract can be made to appear as if it's processing transactions, but it's actually not. This can lead to a denial of service attack, where the contract becomes unresponsive to legitimate requests.
* **Resource Exhaustion:**  The contract can be made to consume a large amount of gas, which can lead to resource exhaustion. This can be exploited to make the contract unresponsive to legitimate requests.
