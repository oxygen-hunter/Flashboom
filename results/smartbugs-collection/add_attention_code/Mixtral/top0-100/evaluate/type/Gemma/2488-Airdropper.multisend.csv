The `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  The `multisend` function calls the `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function for each destination address.  This means that an attacker could potentially call the `multisend` function multiple times, each time before the previous one has finished. 
* **Potential for Loss:**  This could lead to a situation where the attacker repeatedly calls the `transfer` function, draining the contract's funds.

* **Unchecked Return Values:** The `claimThrone` function doesn't check the return value of `msg.sender.send(valuePaid)`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.
* **Low Level Function Calls:** The `claimThrone` function uses `msg.sender.send(valuePaid)` and `msg.sender.send(excessPaid)`. These functions are low-level and can be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This call to an external contract could be re-entered by the attacker, leading to a re-entrancy attack.
