The `withdrawFunds` function allows an attacker to call `msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)()` before the initial execution is complete. This means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 
* **Unclear Execution:** The code doesn't specify how the `_am` value is handled. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `Collect` multiple times, potentially draining the contract's funds.
