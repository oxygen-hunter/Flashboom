The `disperseToken` function in the `Disperse` contract uses the `transferFrom` function of the ERC20 token contract. This function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:** The `disperseToken` function calls `transferFrom` without any checks for reentrancy. This means an attacker could call the function multiple times in a short period, potentially draining the contract's funds.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.
