The contract uses the `forwardable` function to determine which transactions are eligible for a specific address. This function relies on the `iDeposit` contract to provide information about the transactions.  However, the `iDeposit` contract itself is not a standard smart contract, and its internal logic is not publicly available. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to assess the security of the `forwardable` function. 

The `forwardable` function could be vulnerable to front-running attacks, as it relies on the `iDeposit` contract to determine which transactions are eligible for a specific address.
