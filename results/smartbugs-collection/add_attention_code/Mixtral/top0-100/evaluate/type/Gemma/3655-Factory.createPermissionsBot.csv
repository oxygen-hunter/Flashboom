The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled External Calls:** The `Collect` function allows the `msg.sender` to call a function with `_am` value. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `if` statement within the `Collect` function allows for the possibility of a malicious contract calling the `Collect` function again before the initial execution is complete.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **Unrestricted External Calls:** The `Collect` function allows external calls to be made within the contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `Collect` multiple times within a short period, potentially draining the contract's funds. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The code doesn't have any safeguards to prevent this type of attack.
