The code has several vulnerabilities:

* **Unchecked Return Values:** The `claimThrone` function returns a boolean value, but it doesn't check the return value. This can lead to unexpected behavior.
* **Low Level Function Calls:** The `msg.sender.send` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
* **Unprotected Access Control:** The `transferOwnership` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
* **Unclear State Management:** The code lacks clear state management, making it difficult to understand how the contract works. 
* **Lack of Error Handling:** The code lacks error handling, which can lead to unexpected behavior. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:** The `claimThrone` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

The `withdraw` function in the `Reentrance` contract allows an attacker to call `withdraw` repeatedly, draining the contract of funds. This is because the `withdraw` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_amount)()` which allows the attacker to call the `withdraw` function again and again.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `Collect` function doesn't explicitly check for reentrancy. If an attacker can call `Collect` multiple times in rapid succession, they could potentially drain the contract's funds.
