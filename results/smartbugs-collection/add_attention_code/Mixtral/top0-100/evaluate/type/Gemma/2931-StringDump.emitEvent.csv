 The code has several vulnerabilities related to the `send` function.  Here's why:

* **`msg.sender.send(valuePaid)`:** This line sends the `valuePaid` to the `msg.sender` address.  The `send` function in Solidity is not a safe way to transfer funds. It does not handle errors or rejections. If the `msg.sender` address is not the intended recipient, the funds could be lost. 
* **`msg.sender.send(excessPaid)`:**  Similar to the previous vulnerability, this line sends the `excessPaid` to the `msg.sender` address. 
* **`currentMonarch.etherAddress.send(compensation)`:** This line sends the `compensation` to the `currentMonarch.etherAddress`.  This is a potential vulnerability as it could be exploited to drain funds from the contract.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This call allows an attacker to potentially call the `Collect` function again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The code doesn't handle the potential for multiple calls to the `Collect` function, leading to a reentrancy attack.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `if` statement allows the `Collect` function to call an external contract (`msg.sender.call.value(_am)`) before the `Collect` function's execution is complete.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call the `Collect` function multiple times within a short period, potentially draining the contract's funds.

The contract relies heavily on `block.timestamp` for its functionality. This makes it susceptible to manipulation by miners, as they can adjust the reported timestamp.

The contract's `emptyCreditors` function has a potential denial of service vulnerability.  It sets the `creditorAddresses` array to an empty array if the length exceeds 1500. This can be exploited to make the contract unresponsive to further requests.

The contract's `insertNnumbers` function can be exploited to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.  Here's why:

* **Infinite Loop:** The `insertNnumbers` function uses a loop that continues indefinitely.  
* **Resource Exhaustion:**  The loop could potentially consume all available memory on the blockchain, leading to a denial of service.

The contract's `ifillArray` function pushes the sender's address into the `listAddresses` array repeatedly, potentially leading to a denial of service attack. This is because the function can be called repeatedly, and the `listAddresses` array can be filled with a large number of addresses, causing the contract to become unresponsive.
