The `transfer` function in the `MultiTransfer` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  The `transfer` function in `MultiTransfer` allows for multiple transfers to be made simultaneously. This creates a window of opportunity for an attacker to call the `transfer` function multiple times within a short timeframe. 
* **Potential for Exploitation:**  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the `transfer` function within a short timeframe. This could lead to the contract being drained of funds.
