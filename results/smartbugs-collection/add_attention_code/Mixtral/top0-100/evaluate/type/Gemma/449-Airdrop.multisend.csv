The `multisend` function in the `Airdrop` contract allows for sending tokens to multiple addresses.  The function does not check the input addresses or the amount of tokens being sent. This can lead to a reentrancy attack, where an attacker can send a large amount of tokens to multiple addresses, draining the contract's funds. 
",unchecked low level calls,2.0,508.0,6.0,5.75640869140625
70,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The `multisend` function calls the `transfer` function of the `Token` contract for each address in the `_to` array. This is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 

Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  The `multisend` function calls the `transfer` function of the `Token` contract for each address in the `_to` array. This means that an attacker could potentially call the `multisend` function multiple times, each time attempting to transfer funds from the contract to the attacker's address. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `transfer` function of the `Token` contract is not designed to handle reentrancy attacks. 
* **Potential for Loss:** If an attacker can successfully re-enter the `multisend` function, they could potentially drain the contract of funds.

The `sendMoney` function in the `SimpleWallet` contract uses `_target.call.value(_value)();`. This line calls a function on the target address with the specified value.  The `call` function is a low-level function that does not propagate errors. If the function call fails, the contract will continue to execute, potentially leading to unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities.
