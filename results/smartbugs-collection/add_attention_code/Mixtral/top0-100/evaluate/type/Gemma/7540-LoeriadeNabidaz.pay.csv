The `TestContract` contract has a vulnerability related to its `pay` function.  The `pay` function allows anyone to send a small amount of Ether to the contract.  The contract then increments a counter and transfers the Ether to the sender if the counter reaches 2.  This is a classic example of a reentrancy vulnerability.

The `pay` function has a potential vulnerability due to the way it handles the `c` variable.  The `c` variable is incremented by 1 each time the `pay` function is called.
