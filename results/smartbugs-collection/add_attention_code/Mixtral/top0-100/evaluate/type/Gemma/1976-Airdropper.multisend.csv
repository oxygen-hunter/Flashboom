The `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  The `multisend` function calls the `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function for each destination address.  This means that an attacker could potentially call the `multisend` function multiple times, each time before the previous one has finished executing. 
* **Potential for Loss:**  This could lead to the attacker draining funds from the contract.
