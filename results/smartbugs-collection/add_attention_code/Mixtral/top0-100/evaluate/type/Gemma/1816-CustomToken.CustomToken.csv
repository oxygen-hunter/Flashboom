The `send` function in Solidity is a low-level function that can be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
 
The vulnerability lies in line 110:             msg.sender.send(valuePaid);
 
The vulnerability lies in line 118:             msg.sender.send(excessPaid);
 
The vulnerability lies in line 132:             currentMonarch.etherAddress.send(compensation);
 
The vulnerability lies in line 174:         wizardAddress.send(amount);
 
These lines call the `send` function, which can be exploited by an attacker to drain funds from the contract. 
 
Here's why:
 
* **Reentrancy:** An attacker can call `claimThrone` multiple times in a short period, potentially draining funds from the contract. 
* **Unprotected `send`:** The `send` function doesn't have any checks to prevent reentrancy or other vulnerabilities. 
* **Lack of Error Handling:** The `send` function doesn't handle errors gracefully, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploits.

The `cash` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  The `cash` function calls `winner.send(subpot)` which is a function call.  This function call can be re-entered by the attacker.
* **Potential for Unintended Execution:**  The attacker can potentially execute the `cash` function multiple times, leading to unintended execution and potentially draining funds.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `if` statement allows the `Collect` function to call an external contract (`msg.sender.call.value(_am)`) before the initial execution is complete.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:** This external call can be exploited by an attacker to call the `Collect` function again and again, draining the contract's funds.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls an external contract (`_addr.call.value(_wei)`) which is a potential point of vulnerability.
* **Reentrancy:**  The attacker can call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time before the previous one has finished executing. This creates a loop where the contract is continuously called, draining funds.
