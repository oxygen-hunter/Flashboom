The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which allows an attacker to potentially call the contract again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Reentrancy:** This creates a reentrancy vulnerability because the contract's state can be altered in the middle of its execution.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls an external contract (`_addr`) with a value (`_wei`). 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The external contract call could be reentrant, meaning it could be called again before the initial call is complete. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** This could lead to an attacker repeatedly calling the `WithdrawToHolder` function, draining funds from the contract.

The `airDrop` function in the `ModifierEntrancy` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `airDrop` function calls another contract (`ModifierEntrancy`) which can be exploited by an attacker.

The contract's `checkBalances` function is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.  Here's why:

* **Excessive Calls:** The `checkBalances` function iterates through the `addresses` array, potentially performing a large number of expensive operations (e.g., balance lookups) for each address. This can lead to a DoS attack if an attacker can control a large number of addresses.
* **Resource Exhaustion:**  The `checkBalances` function could exhaust the contract's gas reserves, making it unavailable to other users. 
* **Unpredictable Behavior:** The function's behavior is not well-defined. It could lead to unexpected behavior, such as a denial of service, if the number of addresses is large.

The contract's `checkBalances` function is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unbounded Loop:** The `checkBalances` function iterates through an array of addresses.  The loop doesn't have a defined upper limit, meaning it could potentially run indefinitely.
* **Resource Exhaustion:**  An attacker could potentially send a large number of requests to the contract, causing the `checkBalances` function to consume excessive gas and resources. 
* **Potential for Denial of Service:**  This could lead to the contract becoming unresponsive to legitimate requests, effectively denying service to other users.

The `checkBalances` function is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.  Here's why:

* **Resource Exhaustion:** The function iterates through the provided `addresses` array, attempting to access the balance of each address. This can lead to a significant increase in gas consumption, potentially exhausting the contract's gas limit.
* **Potential for Manipulation:** The `checkBalances` function is designed to return balances, but it doesn't explicitly check for malicious inputs. An attacker could manipulate the `addresses` array to include a large number of addresses, leading to a massive gas consumption and potentially causing the contract to become unresponsive.
