The `Command` function in the `Freebie` contract allows arbitrary code execution by calling the target address with the provided data and value. This is a classic example of a reentrancy vulnerability.

* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `Command` multiple times, potentially draining the contract's funds. 
* **Lack of Context:** The `Command` function doesn't provide any context about the data it's executing, making it difficult to identify potential vulnerabilities.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is an external contract call. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This external call could be re-entered by the attacker, leading to a chain of calls that drain the contract's funds.
