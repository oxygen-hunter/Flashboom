The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `if` statement checks if the `msg.sender` has a balance and if the current time is after the `acc.unlockTime`. If so, it calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 
* **Unclear Execution:** The code doesn't specify how the `_am` value is handled. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:** The `Collect` function could be called repeatedly by an attacker, leading to a reentrancy attack.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `if` statement checks if the balance is sufficient and if the current time is after the `unlockTime`. If it is, the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` function is executed. This function call is external to the contract and could be exploited by an attacker.
* **Reentrancy:** The attacker could call the `Collect` function repeatedly, potentially draining the contract's funds.
