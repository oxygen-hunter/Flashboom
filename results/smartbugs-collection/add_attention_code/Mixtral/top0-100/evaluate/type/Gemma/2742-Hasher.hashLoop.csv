The `withdraw` function calls `fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall` with a function signature (`fibSig`) and a value (`withdrawalCounter`). This is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 

Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  A reentrancy attack occurs when an attacker calls a contract's function multiple times within a short period, potentially draining the contract's funds.
* **`delegatecall`:** The `delegatecall` function allows a contract to execute a function on another contract. 
* **Vulnerability:**  The `withdraw` function could be vulnerable to reentrancy because it calls `fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall` without proper checks. An attacker could call `withdraw` repeatedly, potentially draining the contract's funds.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `Collect` function doesn't have proper checks to prevent reentrancy. 
* **Potential for Multiple Calls:** An attacker could call `Collect` multiple times within a short period, draining the contract's funds.

The `hashLoop` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `hashLoop` function calls `keccak256` which is a cryptographic hash function.  This function is designed to be deterministic, meaning it produces the same hash for the same input.
* **Reentrancy:**  The `hashLoop` function is susceptible to reentrancy because it uses a loop that executes multiple times.  An attacker could call `hashLoop` multiple times within the same transaction, potentially leading to a reentrancy attack.
