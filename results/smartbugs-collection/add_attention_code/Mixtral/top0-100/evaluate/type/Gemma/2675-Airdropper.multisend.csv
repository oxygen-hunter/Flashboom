The `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  The `multisend` function calls the `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function for each recipient.  This means that an attacker could potentially call the `multisend` function multiple times, each time before the previous one has finished. 
* **Unprotected Transfers:** The `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function is not designed to handle reentrancy.  This means that an attacker could potentially drain funds from the contract.

* **Reentrancy Attacks:** The `claimThrone` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
* **Arithmetic Overflows and Underflows:** The code doesn't handle arithmetic overflows and underflows well. 
* **Access Control Vulnerabilities:** The `transferOwnership` function is vulnerable to access control vulnerabilities.

* **Gas Limit and Loops:** The `claimThrone` function has a loop that runs for an indeterminate number of iterations.
