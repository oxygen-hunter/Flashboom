The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 
* **Unclear Execution Flow:** The code doesn't clearly define how the `Collect` function interacts with the external contract. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `Collect` multiple times, potentially draining the contract's funds.
