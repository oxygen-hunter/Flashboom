The `transfer` function in the `airPort` contract calls `caddress.call` without any checks. This is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 

Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  A reentrancy attack occurs when an attacker calls a contract function multiple times within a short time frame, potentially draining funds.
* **`caddress.call`:** The `caddress.call` function executes the provided code at the specified address. 
* **Lack of Checks:** The `transfer` function doesn't check if the `caddress` is actually a valid contract or if the `caddress.call` function is successful.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This call to an external contract could be reentrant, meaning an attacker could call the `Collect` function multiple times before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `Collect` function doesn't have any checks to prevent this.
