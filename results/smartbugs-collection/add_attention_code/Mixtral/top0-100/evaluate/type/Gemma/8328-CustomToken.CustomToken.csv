The `claimThrone` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
 
Here's why:
 
* **Reentrancy:** The `claimThrone` function allows the attacker to call it repeatedly, potentially draining funds.
* **Potential for Exploitation:** The `msg.sender.send(valuePaid)` line is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
 
The attacker can call `claimThrone` multiple times, each time sending a different amount of Ether. 
 
* **Example:** An attacker could call `claimThrone` with a small amount of Ether, then call it again with a larger amount, draining the contract's funds. 
 
**Mitigation:** 
* **Reentrancy Guard:** Implement a reentrancy guard to prevent the attacker from calling `claimThrone` multiple times. 
* **Transaction Locking:**  Consider using a transaction locking mechanism to prevent the attacker from executing multiple transactions.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This call to an external contract could be re-entered by the attacker, leading to a re-entrancy attack.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `Collect` function doesn't explicitly check for reentrancy. If an attacker calls `Collect` multiple times in rapid succession, they could potentially drain the contract's funds.
