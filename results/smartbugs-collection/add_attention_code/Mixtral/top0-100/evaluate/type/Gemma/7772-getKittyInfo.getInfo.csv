The code has several vulnerabilities related to the `send` function.  Here's why:

* **Potential for Transaction Failure:** The `send` function in Solidity can fail.  This means the contract might not be able to send the specified amount to the recipient.
* **Lack of Error Handling:** The code doesn't handle the case where `send` fails. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds. 
* **Unclear Error Handling:** The code doesn't explicitly handle the case where `send` fails.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is an external contract call. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This call could be re-entered by the attacker, leading to a chain of calls that drain the contract's funds.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unprotected External Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls `_addr.call.value(_wei)()` which is a direct call to an external address. This means an attacker could potentially call the function multiple times in a row, draining the contract's funds. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The function doesn't include any checks to prevent multiple calls or to ensure the funds are actually being withdrawn.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled External Calls:** The `Collect` function allows the `msg.sender` to call a function with `value(_am)` before the initial execution is complete. This means the contract's state could be modified in the middle of the execution.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())` line creates a window for an attacker to call the `Collect` function multiple times, draining the contract's funds.
