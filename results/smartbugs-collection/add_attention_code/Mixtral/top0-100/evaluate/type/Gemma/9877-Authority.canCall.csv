The `canCall` function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  The `canCall` function allows for multiple calls to the same function. 
* **Potential for Exploitation:**  An attacker could call `canCall` repeatedly, potentially draining the contract's funds. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The function doesn't include any safeguards to prevent reentrancy.
