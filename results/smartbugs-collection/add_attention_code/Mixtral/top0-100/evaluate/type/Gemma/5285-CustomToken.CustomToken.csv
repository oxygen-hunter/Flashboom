The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This call to an external contract could be reentrant, meaning an attacker could call the `Collect` function multiple times before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `Collect` function doesn't have any checks to prevent this.
