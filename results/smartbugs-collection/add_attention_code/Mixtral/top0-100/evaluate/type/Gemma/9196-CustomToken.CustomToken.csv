* **Unprotected `send`:** The `send` function doesn't have any checks to prevent reentrancy.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is an external contract call. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This external call could be re-entered by the attacker, leading to a chain of calls that drain the contract's funds.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls an external contract (`_addr.call.value(_wei)`) which is a potential point of vulnerability.
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:**  The `WithdrawToHolder` function doesn't handle the external contract call's return value. This means an attacker could potentially call the function multiple times, draining the contract's funds.
