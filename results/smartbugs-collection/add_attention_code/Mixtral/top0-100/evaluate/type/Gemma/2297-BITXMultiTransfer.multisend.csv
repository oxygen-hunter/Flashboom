Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:** The `multisend` function could be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. An attacker could call the `multisend` function multiple times, each time attempting to transfer funds to a different address. 
* **Lack of Input Validation:** The `multisend` function does not validate the input values. An attacker could send a large amount of tokens to the contract, potentially causing a denial-of-service attack. 
* **Lack of Gas Limit:** The `multisend` function does not have a gas limit. This could lead to the contract running out of gas and failing.
