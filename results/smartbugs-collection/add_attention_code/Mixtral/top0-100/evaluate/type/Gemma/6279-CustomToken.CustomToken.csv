The code has several vulnerabilities:

* **Unchecked Return Values:** The `claimThrone` function doesn't check the return value of `msg.sender.send(valuePaid)`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.
* **Low Level Function Calls:** The `send` function is a low-level function that doesn't propagate errors. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.
* **Reentrancy Attacks:** The `claimThrone` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
* **Arithmetic Overflows and Underflows:** The code doesn't handle arithmetic overflows and underflows well. 
* **Access Control Vulnerabilities:** The `transferOwnership` function is vulnerable to access control vulnerabilities. 
* **Randomness:** The code doesn't use true randomness, which can lead to vulnerabilities. 
* **Gas Limit and Loops:** The `claimThrone` function has a loop that runs indefinitely. This can lead to a contract running out of gas and failing. 
* **Timestamp Dependence:** The `claimThrone` function uses the block timestamp for critical functionality. This can be manipulated by miners.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `if` statement allows the `Collect` function to call an external contract (`msg.sender.call.value(_am)`) before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:** This creates a window for an attacker to call the `Collect` function again and again, draining the contract's funds.

* **External Contract Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls an external contract (`_addr.call.value(_wei)`) which is a potential point of vulnerability.
* **Reentrancy:**  The attacker can call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time before the previous one has finished executing. This creates a loop where the contract's state is constantly changing, leading to a reentrancy attack.
