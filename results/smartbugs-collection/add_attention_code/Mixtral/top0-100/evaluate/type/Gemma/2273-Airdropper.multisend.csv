The `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  The `multisend` function calls the ERC20 token's `transfer` function for each recipient.  This means that an attacker could potentially call the `multisend` function multiple times in rapid succession, each time attempting to transfer funds to a different address. 
* **Unprotected Transfers:** The `transfer` function in the ERC20 contract is not designed to handle reentrancy.  This means that if an attacker can execute the `multisend` function multiple times, they could potentially drain the contract of funds.

* **Unprotected Access:** The `transferOwnership` function is not restricted to the owner. This could allow an attacker to change the contract's ownership.
