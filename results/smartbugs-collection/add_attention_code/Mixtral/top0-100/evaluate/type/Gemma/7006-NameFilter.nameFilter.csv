The `nameFilter` function is vulnerable to a variety of attacks.  Here's why:

* **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The function doesn't properly validate the input string. It allows arbitrary code execution by accepting any string as input. 
* **Buffer Overflow:** The function doesn't check the length of the input string. This could lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite memory and execute malicious code. 
* **Logic Errors:** The function's logic is flawed and doesn't account for all possible inputs.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `if` statement checks for a condition before calling `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is an external contract call.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The attacker can call the `Collect` function multiple times within a short period, potentially draining the contract's funds.

The `nameFilter` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  The function uses a `bytes` array to store the input string.
