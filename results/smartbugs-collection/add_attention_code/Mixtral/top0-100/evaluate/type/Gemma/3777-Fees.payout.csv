The `payout` function is vulnerable because it transfers a portion of the contract's balance to multiple addresses. This is a classic example of a reentrancy attack. 

Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:** The `payout` function calls the `WithdrawToHolder` function, which is a function that can be called multiple times. 
* **Potential for Exploitation:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` repeatedly while the contract is still processing the `payout` function. 
* **Loss of Funds:** The attacker could drain the contract's funds by repeatedly calling `WithdrawToHolder` before the `payout` function has finished processing.
