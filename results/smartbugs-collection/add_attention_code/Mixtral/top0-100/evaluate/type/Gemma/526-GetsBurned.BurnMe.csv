The `BurnMe` function in the `TestContract` contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  The `BurnMe` function calls `selfdestruct(address(this))`, which destroys the contract. This function is designed to be executed in a single transaction. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  If an attacker can call `BurnMe` multiple times in rapid succession, they could potentially execute the `selfdestruct` function multiple times, draining the contract's funds. 
* **Exploitation:**  The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling `BurnMe` before the contract's funds are fully transferred.
