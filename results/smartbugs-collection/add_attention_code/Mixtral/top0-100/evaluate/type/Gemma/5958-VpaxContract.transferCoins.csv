The `transferCoins` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  A reentrancy attack occurs when a malicious actor calls a contract's function multiple times within a short timeframe, exploiting the contract's internal logic. 
* **Vulnerable Code:** The `transferCoins` function doesn't have any explicit checks to prevent reentrancy. 
* **Potential for Exploitation:**  An attacker could repeatedly call `transferCoins` with the same `receiver` address, draining the contract's funds.
