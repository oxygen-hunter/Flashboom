The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is an external contract call. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This external call could be re-entered by the attacker, leading to a chain of calls that drain the contract's funds.
