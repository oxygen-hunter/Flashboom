The `CustomToken` contract does not have a constructor function, which means that the `totalSupply` variable is not initialized. This means that the `totalSupply` variable is set to a default value of 0, which means that the `balanceOf` mapping is also set to a default value of 0. This means that the `CustomToken` contract has no tokens in its balance, and the `transfer` function in the `BaseToken` contract will fail if it is called.

Therefore, the `CustomToken` contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack, as the `transfer` function in the `BaseToken` contract can be called multiple times, leading to a failure of the contract.",unchecked low level calls,2.0,610.0,6.0,2.6599433422088623

72,unchecked low level calls,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of the `call` function, which does not propagate errors and can lead to fail-opens and other unwanted outcomes. The `call` function is used in the `proxy` function, which can be exploited by an attacker to call the `transferOwner` function and change the owner of the contract. This can lead to unauthorized access and control of the contract.

The `call` function is used in the following line of code:
```

This line of code calls the `transferOwner` function of the target contract, which can be exploited by an attacker to change the owner of the contract. The `call` function does not propagate errors, so if the `transferOwner` function fails, the code will continue to run and the attacker can gain unauthorized access to the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `call` function should be replaced with a function that propagates errors, such as `callcode` or `delegatecall`.

Therefore, it is not possible for an external contract to call the `CashOut` function and manipulate the state of the contract.",reentrancy,1.0,511.0,6.0,2.243069648742676
123,reentrancy,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The reason is that the contract does not allow external contract calls before the initial execution is complete. The `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` function is only called after the `acc.balance>=MinSum && acc.balance>=_am && now>acc.unlockTime` condition is met, which ensures that the contract state does not change in the middle of its execution.",reentrancy,1.0,523.0,6.0,2.2490475177764893
124,reentrancy,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The reason is that the function CashOut is not calling any external contracts, and it is not using any low level functions with an external address.",reentrancy,1.0,478.0,6.0,3.5402491092681885
125,reentrancy,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The reason is that the `Collect` function calls the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` function, which allows the contract to make a new call to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. This can cause the contract state to change in the middle of its execution, leading to unintended behavior.",reentrancy,3.0,512.0,6.0,1.843168020248413
126,reentrancy,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to withdraw their balance from a mapping. The withdrawBalance function is not calling any external contracts or using any low-level functions that can be exploited. Therefore, there is no possibility of reentrancy attack.",reentrancy,1.0,500.0,6.0,2.739168405532837
127,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple contract that inherits from a base contract and overrides the constructor to set the total supply of tokens and the balance of a specific address. It does not contain any vulnerabilities related to time or manipulation.",time manipulation,1.0,486.0,6.0,2.6677706241607666
128,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a solidity contract that inherits from the BaseToken contract and overrides the constructor function to set the total supply of tokens and the balance of the owner's account. It also emits a Transfer event to log the transfer of tokens from the zero address to the owner's account.

Therefore, the code does not rely on the block.timestamp or now to generate random numbers, and it does not use the block.timestamp to unlock funds at a specific time. Therefore, it does not have any vulnerabilities related to time manipulation or random number generation.",time manipulation,3.0,548.0,6.0,3.2692227363586426
129,time manipulation,"  NO, this code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to invest Ether into a jackpot and then reset the jackpot after a certain amount of time has passed. The contract does not use any external contracts or libraries, and it does not have any known vulnerabilities.",time manipulation,1.0,492.0,6.0,3.8304431438446045
130,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows anyone to send 10 Ether to the contract, and the contract will transfer the funds to the sender if the current time is not equal to the previous time. The code does not use any external contracts or functions, and it does not have any vulnerabilities related to reentrancy, arithmetic overflows, unchecked return values, access control, randomness, gas limit, or timestamp dependence.",time manipulation,1.0,528.0,6.0,2.6448960304260254
131,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to play a game by sending ether to the contract. The contract has a modifier that checks if the sender has sent the correct amount of ether, and it also uses the block.timestamp to generate a random number. The code does not use any external contracts or libraries, and it does not have any known vulnerabilities.",time manipulation,1.0,515.0,6.0,2.941901445388794
132,short addresses,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a short address attack. The reason is that the `sendCoin` function uses the `msg.sender` address as the key to access the `balances` mapping, which is a vulnerability in the EVM. This allows an attacker to exploit the contract by sending a specially crafted transaction that causes the `msg.sender` address to be encoded incorrectly, leading to a short address attack.",short addresses,3.0,518.0,6.0,2.663024425506592
133,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The code is a simple smart contract that has two functions: `emptyCreditors` and `addCreditors`. The `emptyCreditors` function is vulnerable to a denial of service attack because it sets the `creditorAddresses` array to an empty array if the length of the array is greater than 1500. This can cause the contract to run out of gas and fail. However, the `addCreditors` function does not have this vulnerability.",denial of service,3.0,543.0,6.0,2.811856985092163
134,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a smart contract that implements a simple array-based data structure. It has a function called `insertNnumbers` that inserts a given number of elements into an array, and a function called `clear` that clears the array. The code also has a constructor function that initializes the array with a fixed number of elements.

There is no vulnerability in the code that could be exploited by an attacker. The code is well-structured and has no obvious vulnerabilities. The only potential issue I can see is that the `clear` function requires the `numElements` variable to be greater than 1500, which could be a potential issue if the variable is not properly initialized. However, this is not a vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker.",denial of service,1.0,595.0,6.0,3.007171630859375
135,denial of service,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable. The code is written in Solidity, and it is a well-known and widely-used language for writing smart contracts. The code is also well-structured and easy to understand, which suggests that it is not vulnerable to any common attacks.",denial of service,1.0,490.0,6.0,4.179470777511597
136,denial of service,"  NO, this code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to refund their funds to a list of predefined addresses. The contract has a constructor that initializes the list of refund addresses and a function called ""refundAll"" that sends the funds to each address in the list. The contract also has a mapping of addresses to their corresponding refund amounts.

There is no apparent vulnerability in the code. The contract is well-structured and the functions are clearly defined. The only potential issue could be if the contract is used to send funds to a malicious address, but this is not a vulnerability in the code itself.",denial of service,1.0,561.0,6.0,2.2827587127685547
137,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that has a function called `ifillArray` that fills an array with 350 addresses. The function returns true if the array is less than 1500 addresses, and false otherwise. The code does not have any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker.",denial of service,1.0,504.0,6.0,2.938830852508545
138,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to bid on a token. It has a modifier that checks if the bid is greater than the current bid, and it also checks if the current frontrunner is not 0 before sending the bid. The code also sets the current frontrunner to the sender of the transaction and sets the current bid to the value of the transaction.

Therefore, the code does not have any known vulnerabilities.",denial of service,1.0,533.0,6.0,2.624890089035034
