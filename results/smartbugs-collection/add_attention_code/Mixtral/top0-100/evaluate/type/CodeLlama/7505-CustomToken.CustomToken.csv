72,unchecked low level calls,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of the `call` function, which does not propagate errors and can lead to fail-opens and other unwanted outcomes. The `call` function is used in the `proxy` function, which can be exploited by an attacker to call the `transferOwner` function and change the owner of the contract. This can lead to unauthorized access and control of the contract.

The `call` function is used in the following line of code:
```
target.call.value(msg.value)(data);
```
This line of code calls the `transferOwner` function of the target contract, which can be exploited by an attacker to change the owner of the contract. The `call` function does not propagate errors, so if the `transferOwner` function fails, the code will continue to run and the attacker can gain unauthorized access to the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `call` function should be replaced with a function that propagates errors, such as `callcode` or `delegatecall`. This will ensure that any errors that occur during the execution of the `transferOwner` function are properly handled and the code will not continue to run if the function fails.",unchecked low level calls,3.0,685.0,6.0,1.8239476680755615

However, if the number of tokens being purchased is greater than the maximum value of an unsigned integer (2^256 - 1), this check will fail and the transaction will be reverted. This can allow an attacker to send a large number of tokens to the contract, potentially causing a denial of service or theft.

Similarly, in the `sell` function, the line `require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= numTokens);` checks that the number of tokens being sold is less than or equal to the number of tokens owned by the sender.

It does not contain any vulnerabilities related to time or manipulation.",time manipulation,1.0,486.0,6.0,1.5868635177612305
128,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a solidity contract that inherits from the BaseToken contract and overrides the constructor function to set the total supply of tokens and the balance of the owner's account. It also emits a Transfer event to log the transfer of tokens from the zero address to the owner's account.

There is no vulnerability in the code that could be exploited by an attacker. The code is well-written and follows best practices for solidity contract development.",time manipulation,1.0,526.0,6.0,5.615067958831787
129,time manipulation,"  NO, this code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to invest Ether into a jackpot and then reset the jackpot after a certain amount of time has passed. The contract does not use any external contracts or libraries, and it does not have any known vulnerabilities.",time manipulation,1.0,492.0,6.0,2.434844732284546
130,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows anyone to send 10 Ether to the contract, and the contract will transfer the balance of the contract to the sender if the current time is a multiple of 15. There is no apparent vulnerability in the code.",time manipulation,1.0,495.0,6.0,2.6576220989227295
131,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to play a game by sending ether to the contract. The contract has a modifier that checks if the sender has sent the correct amount of ether, and it also has a modifier that checks if the random number generated is 0. The contract also has a modifier that transfers the fee to the bank and the remaining amount to the sender. The code does not have any vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an attacker.",time manipulation,1.0,535.0,6.0,2.805265426635742
132,short addresses,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a short address attack. The reason is that the `sendCoin` function uses the `msg.sender` address as the key to access the `balances` mapping, which is a vulnerability in the EVM. This allows an attacker to exploit the contract by sending a specially crafted transaction that causes the `msg.sender` address to be encoded incorrectly, leading to a short address attack.",short addresses,3.0,518.0,6.0,2.5204362869262695
133,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The code is a simple smart contract that has two functions: `emptyCreditors` and `addCreditors`. The `emptyCreditors` function is vulnerable to a denial of service attack because it sets the `creditorAddresses` array to an empty array if the length of the array is greater than 1500. This can cause the contract to run out of gas and fail. However, the `addCreditors` function does not have this vulnerability.",denial of service,3.0,543.0,6.0,3.0896155834198
134,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that has a function to insert a number into an array and a function to clear the array. There is no evidence of any vulnerability in the code.",denial of service,1.0,481.0,6.0,2.8805086612701416
135,denial of service,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable. The code is written in Solidity, and it is a well-known and widely-used language for writing smart contracts. The code is also well-structured and easy to understand, which suggests that it is not vulnerable to any common attacks.",denial of service,1.0,490.0,6.0,2.249072551727295
136,denial of service,"  NO, this code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to refund their funds to a list of predefined addresses. The contract has a constructor that initializes the list of refund addresses and a function called ""refundAll"" that sends the funds to each address in the list. The contract also has a mapping of addresses to their corresponding refund amounts.

There is no apparent vulnerability in the code. The contract is well-structured and the functions are clearly defined. The only potential issue could be if the contract is used to send funds to a malicious address, but this is not a vulnerability in the code itself.",denial of service,1.0,561.0,6.0,3.0954387187957764
137,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that has a function called `ifillArray` that fills an array with 350 addresses. The function returns true if the array is less than 1500 addresses, and false otherwise. The code does not have any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker.",denial of service,1.0,504.0,6.0,2.315485954284668
138,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to bid on a token. It has a modifier that checks if the bid is greater than the current bid, and it also checks if the current frontrunner is not 0 before sending the bid. The code also sets the current frontrunner to the sender of the transaction and sets the current bid to the value of the transaction.

Therefore, the code does not have any known vulnerabilities.",denial of service,1.0,533.0,6.0,2.623253345489502
