However, this function does not check if the result is negative, which can lead to an arithmetic underflow. Additionally, the `transferFrom` function also uses the `SafeMath.sub` function, but it does not check if the result is negative.

The vulnerability lies in the use of the `selfdestruct` function, which allows any address to call the `sudicideAnyone` function and destroy the contract. This is a critical vulnerability that can be exploited by malicious actors to steal the funds stored in the contract.

The `selfdestruct` function is a part of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and is used to destroy a contract and send its remaining funds to a specified address. However, the function can be called by any address, not just the owner of the contract. This means that an attacker can call the `sudicideAnyone` function and destroy the contract, regardless of who the owner is.

To fix this vulnerability, the `selfdestruct` function should only be callable by the owner of the contract, or by a designated address that has been approved by the owner. This can be achieved by using the `require` function to check the caller's address before calling the `selfdestruct` function. For example:

This can lead to a reentrancy attack, where an attacker can repeatedly call the `isSaleFinished` function and drain the contract of funds.

The reason for this vulnerability is that the `block.timestamp` variable is not a secure source of randomness, as it can be manipulated by miners. This means that the contract's behavior is not deterministic, and an attacker can exploit this to repeatedly call the `isSaleFinished` function and drain the contract of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a secure source of randomness, such as a secure random number generator, to generate the random number.
