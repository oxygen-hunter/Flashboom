The `ecrecover` function can be used to recover the address of a signer who has signed a message with a specific hash and signature.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a transaction to the contract with a valid signature, but with a different hash. The contract will then recover the address of the signer, which is not the intended address. The attacker can then use this address to call the `set` function and set the value of a key in the map to a different value.

However, the function does not use the `msg.value` variable to check if the correct amount of Ether has been sent. Therefore, it is possible for an attacker to send a different amount of Ether and still be able to call the function.
