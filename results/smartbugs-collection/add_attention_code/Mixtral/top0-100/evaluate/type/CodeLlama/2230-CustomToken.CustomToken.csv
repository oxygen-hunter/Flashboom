The `onlyowner` modifier is used to restrict access to the `withdraw` function to the owner of the contract, which is the address that deployed the contract. The `owner` variable is set to the address that deployed the contract in the constructor function. Therefore, the `onlyowner` modifier is correctly used to restrict access to the `withdraw` function.

The vulnerability lies in the `forward` function, which calls the `delegatecall` function on the `callee` address. This allows the `callee` address to call back into the `Proxy` contract, potentially causing a reentrancy attack.

Reentrancy attacks occur when a contract calls another contract, and the called contract calls back into the original contract, causing a loop. This can cause the original contract to run out of gas and fail.

72,unchecked low level calls,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, which inherits from the `BaseToken` contract. The `CustomToken` contract does not have a constructor function, which means that the `totalSupply` variable is not initialized. This means that the `totalSupply` variable is set to a default value of 0, which means that the `balanceOf` mapping is also set to a default value of 0. This means that the `CustomToken` contract has no tokens in its balance, and the `transfer` function in the `BaseToken` contract will fail if the sender does not have enough tokens to transfer.

Therefore, the `CustomToken` contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack, where an attacker can repeatedly call the `transfer` function and drain the contract of funds.",unchecked low level calls,2.0,607.0,6.0,2.4492955207824707

If it is even, it pays 1800 finney to the first player, otherwise it pays 1800 finney to the second player. The `getProfit` function allows the owner of the contract to withdraw the balance of the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `add` function should check for overflows before incrementing the `balance` variable.

82,arithmetic,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the fact that it does not handle arithmetic overflows and underflows correctly. The contract uses unsigned integers, which can lead to unexpected behavior when performing arithmetic operations. For example, in the buy function, the line `require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);` can lead to an integer overflow if the number of tokens purchased is greater than the maximum value of an unsigned integer. Similarly, in the sell function, the line `require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= numTokens);` can lead to an integer underflow if the number of tokens sold is greater than the maximum value of an unsigned integer.

Additionally, the contract does not handle the case where the price per token is greater than the maximum value of an unsigned integer. This can lead to unexpected behavior when calculating the total price of tokens sold or purchased.

This can allow an attacker to steal funds from the contract.

Therefore, it is not vulnerable to any known attacks.",time manipulation,3.0,581.0,6.0,1.8385720252990723
132,short addresses,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a short address attack. The reason is that the `sendCoin` function uses the `msg.sender` address as the key to access the `balances` mapping, which is a vulnerability in the EVM. This allows an attacker to exploit the contract by sending a specially crafted transaction that uses a short address, which would cause the contract to access a different address's balance.",short addresses,3.0,517.0,6.0,2.6598756313323975
133,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The code is a simple smart contract that has two functions: `emptyCreditors` and `addCreditors`. The `emptyCreditors` function is vulnerable to a denial of service attack because it sets the `creditorAddresses` array to an empty array if the length of the array is greater than 1500. This can cause the contract to run out of gas and fail, which can lead to a denial of service attack. However, the `addCreditors` function does not have this vulnerability.",denial of service,4.0,553.0,6.0,2.6450140476226807
134,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a smart contract that implements a simple array-based data structure. It has a function called `insertNnumbers` that inserts a given number of elements into an array, and a function called `clear` that clears the array. The code also has a function called `clearDOS` that clears the array and sets the number of elements to 0.

The code does not have any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker. The `insertNnumbers` function checks if the array has enough space to store the new elements, and if not, it increases the size of the array. The `clear` function checks if the number of elements in the array is greater than 1500, and if so, it sets the number of elements to 0. The `clearDOS` function is similar to the `clear` function, but it also sets the length of the array to 0.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to any types of attacks, including denial of service attacks.",denial of service,1.0,646.0,6.0,2.625579595565796
135,denial of service,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable. The code is written in Solidity, and it is a well-known and widely-used language for writing smart contracts. The code is also well-structured and easy to understand, which suggests that it is not vulnerable to any common attacks.",denial of service,1.0,490.0,6.0,1.8482532501220703
136,denial of service,"  NO, this code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to refund their funds to a list of predefined addresses. The contract has a constructor that initializes the list of refund addresses and a function called ""refundAll"" that sends the funds to each address in the list. The contract also has a mapping of addresses to their corresponding refund amounts.

There is no apparent vulnerability in the code. The contract is well-structured and the functions are clearly defined. The only potential issue could be if the contract is used to send funds to a malicious address, but this is not a vulnerability in the code itself.",denial of service,1.0,561.0,6.0,2.527183771133423
137,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that has a function called `ifillArray` that fills an array with 350 addresses. The function returns true if the array is less than 1500 addresses, and false otherwise. The code does not have any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker.",denial of service,1.0,504.0,6.0,4.049001216888428
138,denial of service,"  NO, this code is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The code is a simple auction contract that allows users to bid on a token. The `bid` function checks that the current bid is greater than the previous bid, and then transfers the previous bid to the current bidder. The `currentFrontrunner` variable is used to keep track of the current bidder, and the `currentBid` variable is used to keep track of the current bid.

There is no way for an attacker to manipulate the `currentFrontrunner` or `currentBid` variables to cause a denial of service attack. The `require` statement in the `bid` function ensures that the current bid is greater than the previous bid, and the `send` function in the `bid` function ensures that the current bid is transferred to the current bidder.

Therefore, this code is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack.",denial of service,1.0,621.0,6.0,2.842604160308838
