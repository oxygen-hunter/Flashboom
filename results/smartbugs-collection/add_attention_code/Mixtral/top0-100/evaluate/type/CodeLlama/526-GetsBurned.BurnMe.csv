The vulnerability lies in the BurnMe function, which uses the selfdestruct() function to destroy the contract and send its remaining ether to the address of the contract. This can be exploited by an attacker to steal the remaining ether in the contract.

The vulnerability is due to the fact that the selfdestruct() function is not protected by a check for the remaining balance of the contract. An attacker can call the BurnMe function to destroy the contract and steal its remaining ether, even if the contract has already been completed.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should check the remaining balance of the contract before calling the selfdestruct() function. This can be done by adding a check for the remaining balance before calling the selfdestruct() function.",arithmetic,2.0,592.0,6.0,2.6021907329559326
