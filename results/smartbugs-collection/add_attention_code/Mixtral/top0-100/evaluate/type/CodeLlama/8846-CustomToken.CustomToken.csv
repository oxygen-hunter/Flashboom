17,access control,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The `forward` function in the `Proxy` contract calls the `delegatecall` function on the `callee` contract, which can cause a reentrancy attack if the `callee` contract modifies its state in a way that can be exploited.

The vulnerability lies in the `delegatecall` function, which allows the `Proxy` contract to call the `callee` contract with the same state as the `Proxy` contract. If the `callee` contract modifies its state in a way that can be exploited, it can lead to a reentrancy attack.

For example, if the `callee` contract has a function that modifies its state, and the `Proxy` contract calls the `delegatecall` function on the `callee` contract, the `Proxy` contract will be affected by the changes made to the `callee` contract's state. This can lead to a reentrancy attack, where the `Proxy` contract can be exploited to drain the funds of the `callee` contract.

119,reentrancy,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The reason is that the function `CashOut` is not calling any external contracts or using any low-level functions with external addresses, so it is not susceptible to reentrancy attacks.",reentrancy,1.0,486.0,6.0,5.2715747356414795
120,reentrancy,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The contract is using the `call.value()` function to make a call to the `msg.sender` address, which is a safe way to make a call to an external contract. The `call.value()` function is used to make a call to an external contract while transferring a specific amount of Ether. The amount of Ether being transferred is determined by the `_am` parameter, which is a local variable in the `CashOut()` function. The `_am` variable is not used to make any changes to the contract's state, so there is no possibility of a reentrancy attack.",reentrancy,3.0,567.0,6.0,1.5761315822601318
121,reentrancy,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The reason is that the function ""Collect"" is not calling any external contracts or using any low-level functions that can cause reentrancy. It only checks the balance of the sender and the minimum sum required to collect, and then transfers the amount to the sender if the balance is sufficient.",reentrancy,1.0,507.0,6.0,2.618299961090088

125,reentrancy,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The reason is that the contract does not allow external contract calls before the initial execution is complete. The `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` function is only called after the `balances[msg.sender]>=MinSum && balances[msg.sender]>=_am` condition is met, which ensures that the contract state does not change in the middle of its execution.",reentrancy,1.0,519.0,6.0,2.34159255027771
126,reentrancy,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to withdraw their balances from a mapping. It does not have any external calls or low-level functions that can be exploited.",reentrancy,1.0,483.0,6.0,3.4460206031799316
127,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple contract that inherits from a base contract and overrides the constructor to set the total supply of the token, the name, symbol, and decimals. It also sets the balance of the owner to the total supply and emits a Transfer event. There is no apparent vulnerability in the code.",time manipulation,1.0,503.0,6.0,2.9185545444488525
128,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a combination of two contracts, the first one is a basic smart contract that has a payOut function, and the second one is a custom token that inherits from the basic contract. The custom token has a constructor function that sets the total supply, name, symbol, and decimals of the token. The payOut function in the basic contract uses the block.timestamp to generate a random number, and the draw function in the custom token calls the payOut function with the random number generated by the block.timestamp.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to the time manipulation attack, as the random number generated by the block.timestamp is used to call the payOut function, and the payOut function is not dependent on the block.timestamp.",time manipulation,1.0,590.0,6.0,2.373439073562622
129,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to invest Ether into a jackpot and then reset the jackpot after a certain time. The contract does not use any external contracts or libraries, and it does not have any known vulnerabilities.",time manipulation,1.0,489.0,6.0,3.410160541534424
130,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a combination of two contracts, Roulette and BaseToken, and it is not clear what the purpose of the CustomToken contract is. However, based on the code, it appears that the CustomToken contract is not used in any way in the Roulette contract, and it does not have any vulnerabilities.",time manipulation,1.0,505.0,6.0,3.8846755027770996
131,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a solidity contract that implements a simple lottery game. It has a play function that takes a payment of 10 ether and randomly distributes the funds between the bank and the player. The code also has a modifier that checks if the player has sent the correct amount of ether. The code does not use any external contracts or libraries, and it does not have any known vulnerabilities.",time manipulation,1.0,520.0,6.0,4.191833019256592
132,short addresses,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a short address attack. The reason is that the `sendCoin` function uses the `msg.sender` address as the key to access the `balances` mapping, which is a vulnerability in the EVM. This can be exploited by using specially-crafted addresses to make poorly coded clients encode arguments incorrectly before including them in transactions.",short addresses,3.0,507.0,6.0,2.3119888305664062
133,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a smart contract that inherits from the BaseToken contract and adds a new function called ""CustomToken"" that initializes the total supply of the token, the name, symbol, and decimals. It also sets the balance of the owner of the contract to the total supply. The code does not have any vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an attacker.",denial of service,1.0,515.0,6.0,2.248831272125244
134,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a smart contract that implements a simple array-based data structure. It has a function called `insertNnumbers` that inserts a given number of elements into an array, and a function called `clear` that clears the array. The code also has a function called `clearDOS` that clears the array and sets the number of elements to 0. The code also has two functions called `getLengthArray` and `getRealLengthArray` that return the length of the array and the real length of the array, respectively.

The code does not have any vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an attacker. The `insertNnumbers` function checks if the array has enough space to store the new elements, and if not, it increases the size of the array. The `clear` function checks if the number of elements in the array is greater than 1500, and if so, it sets the number of elements to 0. The `clearDOS` function also checks if the number of elements in the array is greater than 1500, and if so, it sets the number of elements to 0.

The code also has access controls in place, as the `clear` and `clearDOS` functions are only accessible to the owner of the contract. Additionally, the code does not use any external contracts or libraries",denial of service,1.0,715.0,6.0,2.849442481994629

137,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The code is a simple smart contract that has a single function, `ifillArray`, which fills an array with 350 addresses. The function returns true if the array is less than 1500 addresses, and false otherwise. There is no way for an attacker to exploit this function to cause a denial of service.",denial of service,1.0,514.0,6.0,2.4907379150390625
138,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to bid on a token. It has a modifier that checks if the bid is greater than the current bid, and it also checks if the current frontrunner is not 0 before sending the bid. The code also sets the current frontrunner to the sender of the transaction and sets the current bid to the value of the transaction.

Therefore, the code does not have any known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker.",denial of service,1.0,540.0,6.0,2.7414674758911133
