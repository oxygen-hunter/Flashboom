A short address attack is a type of side-channel attack that can be used to manipulate the execution of a smart contract.

The `require` statement is used to check that the `dst` address is equal to a specific value. However, the `dst` address is not properly padded, which can lead to a short address attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the `dst` address should be properly padded before it is compared to the expected value. This can be done by using the `address.to_check",short addresses,3.0,694.0,6.0,2.753329038619995
