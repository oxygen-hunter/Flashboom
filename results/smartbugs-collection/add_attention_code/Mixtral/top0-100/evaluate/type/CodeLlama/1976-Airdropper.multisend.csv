109,reentrancy,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `airDrop` function, which calls the `supportsToken` modifier before updating the token balance. This allows an attacker to call the `airDrop` function again before the first execution is complete, leading to a reentrancy attack.

The `supportsToken` modifier checks if the contract supports the Nu Token, but it does not check if the token balance has been updated before calling the `airDrop` function. This means that the contract can be called multiple times before the token balance is updated, leading to a reentrancy attack.",reentrancy,3.0,564.0,6.0,2.5954389572143555

127,time manipulation,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of the `block.timestamp` variable, which is a source of randomness. However, the contract does not use a secure random number generator, and the value of `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners. This can lead to a reentrancy attack, where an attacker can repeatedly call the `multisend` function and drain the contract of funds.

The vulnerability is due to the fact that the `block.timestamp` variable is used to generate random numbers, which is a common vulnerability in smart contracts. The `block.timestamp` variable is not a secure random number generator, and it can be manipulated by miners. This means that the random numbers generated by the contract can be predictable, which can lead to a reentrancy attack.

To fix the vulnerability, the contract should use a secure random number generator, such as the `random` function in the `SafeMath` library. The `random` function generates a random number using the `block.timestamp` variable, but it also uses a secure random number generator to generate the random number. This ensures that the random number is truly random and not predictable.",time manipulation,4.0,673.0,6.0,2.829712390899658
