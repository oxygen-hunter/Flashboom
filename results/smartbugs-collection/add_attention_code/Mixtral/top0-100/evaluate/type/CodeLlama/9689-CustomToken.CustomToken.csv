125,reentrancy,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The reason is that the contract does not allow external contract calls before the initial execution is complete. The `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` function is only called after the `balances[msg.sender]>=MinSum && balances[msg.sender]>=_am` condition is met, which ensures that the contract state does not change in the middle of its execution.",reentrancy,1.0,519.0,6.0,3.7182273864746094
126,reentrancy,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to withdraw their balance from a mapping. It does not have any external calls or low-level functions that can be exploited.",reentrancy,1.0,483.0,6.0,2.5753369331359863
127,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple contract that inherits from a base contract and overrides the constructor to set the total supply of the token, the name, symbol, and decimals. It also sets the balance of the owner to the total supply and emits a Transfer event. There is no apparent vulnerability in the code.",time manipulation,1.0,503.0,6.0,2.3130252361297607
128,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a combination of two contracts, the first one is a basic smart contract that has a payOut function, and the second one is a custom token that inherits from the base token. The payOut function in the first contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, but the second contract does not have any reentrancy vulnerabilities.",time manipulation,2.0,511.0,6.0,2.7197346687316895
129,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to invest Ether into a jackpot and then reset the jackpot after a certain time. The contract does not use any external contracts or libraries, and it does not have any known vulnerabilities.",time manipulation,1.0,489.0,6.0,1.8575184345245361
130,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a combination of two contracts, Roulette and BaseToken, and it is not clear what the purpose of the CustomToken contract is. However, based on the code, it appears that the CustomToken contract is not used in any way in the Roulette contract, and it does not have any vulnerabilities.",time manipulation,1.0,505.0,6.0,6.0932090282440186
131,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a solidity contract that implements a simple lottery game. It has a play function that takes a payment of 10 ether and randomly distributes the funds between the bank and the player. The code also has a modifier that checks if the player has sent the correct amount of ether. The code does not use any external contracts or libraries, and it does not have any known vulnerabilities.",time manipulation,1.0,520.0,6.0,3.106640100479126
132,short addresses,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a short address attack. The reason is that the `address` type in Solidity is a 160-bit value, but the `to` parameter in the `sendCoin` function is of type `address`, which is a 20-byte value. This means that the `to` parameter can be a short address, which is a 20-byte value that is less than 160 bits. When this happens, the EVM will pad the short address with zeros on the left, which can cause the contract to behave unexpectedly.

For example, if the `to` parameter is a short address, the EVM will pad it with zeros on the left, so the actual address that is used in the contract will be a 160-bit value. This can cause the contract to behave differently than expected, leading to vulnerabilities.

Therefore, it is important to use the `address` type in the `sendCoin` function to ensure that the `to` parameter is a valid 160-bit address.",short addresses,3.0,642.0,6.0,3.488551616668701
133,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a smart contract that inherits from the BaseToken contract and adds a new function called ""CustomToken"" that initializes the total supply of the token, the name, symbol, and decimals. It also sets the balance of the owner of the contract to the total supply. The code does not have any vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an attacker.",denial of service,1.0,515.0,6.0,3.566286325454712
134,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a smart contract that implements a simple array-based data structure. It has a function called `insertNnumbers` that inserts a given number of elements into an array, and a function called `clear` that clears the array. The code also has a function called `clearDOS` that clears the array and sets the number of elements to 0. The code also has two functions called `getLengthArray` and `getRealLengthArray` that return the length of the array and the real length of the array, respectively.

The code does not have any vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an attacker. The `insertNnumbers` function checks if the array has enough space to store the new elements, and if not, it increases the size of the array. The `clear` function checks if the number of elements in the array is greater than 1500, and if so, it sets the number of elements to 0. The `clearDOS` function also checks if the number of elements in the array is greater than 1500, and if so, it sets the number of elements to 0.

The code also has access controls in place, as the `clear` and `clearDOS` functions are only accessible to the owner of the contract. Additionally, the code does not use any external contracts or libraries",denial of service,1.0,715.0,6.0,1.787719964981079
