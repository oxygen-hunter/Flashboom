126,reentrancy,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The reason is that the `withdrawBalance` function is not calling any external contracts or using any low-level functions that can be exploited. It only calls the `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""")` function, which is a low-level function that allows the caller to transfer Ether to the contract. However, this function is not called before the execution of the `withdrawBalance` function is complete, so there is no possibility of reentrancy attack.",reentrancy,1.0,541.0,6.0,2.904130458831787
127,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a solidity contract that has a function called isSaleFinished() that returns true if the current block timestamp is greater than or equal to 1546300800. This function is not vulnerable to any known attacks.",time manipulation,1.0,488.0,6.0,2.636244535446167
128,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a smart contract that implements a simple lottery game. It has a `payOut` function that pays out the winner and a `draw` function that calls the `payOut` function. The `randomGen` function generates a random number and the `payOut` function checks if the random number is greater than 0 and if the current time minus the random number is greater than 24 hours. If both conditions are true, the function sends the funds to the winner. The code also has a `CustomToken` contract that inherits from the `BaseToken` contract and has a total supply of 84000000000000000000000000 and assigns it to the owner's address.

Therefore, the code does not have any vulnerabilities related to time manipulation or randomness.",time manipulation,1.0,601.0,6.0,2.261977195739746
129,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to invest Ether into a jackpot and then reset the jackpot after a certain time. The contract does not use any external contracts or libraries, and it does not have any known vulnerabilities.",time manipulation,1.0,489.0,6.0,1.935225009918213
130,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a combination of two contracts, Roulette and BaseToken, and it is not clear what the purpose of the CustomToken contract is. However, based on the code, it appears that the CustomToken contract is not used in any way in the Roulette contract, and it does not have any vulnerabilities.",time manipulation,1.0,505.0,6.0,3.234703540802002
131,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a solidity contract that implements a simple lottery game. It has a play function that takes a payment of 10 ether and randomly distributes the funds between the bank and the player. The code also has a modifier that checks if the player has sent the correct amount of ether. The code does not use any external libraries or functions that could be vulnerable.",time manipulation,1.0,515.0,6.0,2.013392448425293
132,short addresses,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a short address attack. The reason is that the `address` type in Solidity is a 160-bit value, but the `to` parameter in the `sendCoin` function is of type `address`, which is a 20-byte value. This means that the `to` parameter can be a short address, which is a 20-byte value that is less than 160 bits. When this happens, the EVM will pad the short address with zeros on the left, which can cause the contract to behave unexpectedly.

For example, if the `to` parameter is a short address, the EVM will pad it with zeros on the left, so the actual address that is used in the contract will be a 160-bit value. This can cause the contract to behave differently than expected, leading to vulnerabilities.

Therefore, it is important to use the `address` type in the `sendCoin` function to ensure that the `to` parameter is a valid 160-bit address.",short addresses,3.0,642.0,6.0,2.311342239379883
133,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a smart contract that implements a simple token with a custom token. The contract has a constructor function that initializes the token's name, symbol, decimals, and total supply. It also has a mapping of the token's balance for each address. The contract also has a function to transfer tokens from one address to another.

The code does not have any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker. The constructor function is properly initialized, and the transfer function is properly implemented. The code also has a custom token that inherits from the BaseToken contract and overrides the constructor function to set the token's name, symbol, decimals, and total supply.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to any known attacks.",denial of service,1.0,586.0,6.0,3.0032124519348145
134,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a smart contract that implements a simple array-based data structure. It has a function called `insertNnumbers` that inserts a given number of elements into an array, and a function called `clear` that clears the array. The code also has a function called `clearDOS` that clears the array and sets the number of elements to 0. The code also has two functions called `getLengthArray` and `getRealLengthArray` that return the length of the array and the real length of the array, respectively.

The code does not have any vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an attacker. The `insertNnumbers` function checks if the number of elements in the array is equal to the length of the array before inserting a new element, and it also checks if the number of elements in the array is greater than 1500 before clearing the array. The `clearDOS` function also checks if the number of elements in the array is greater than 1500 before clearing the array.

The code also has access controls in place, as the `clear` function requires the number of elements in the array to be greater than 1500, and the `clearDOS` function requires the number of elements in the array to be greater than 1500 before clearing the array.

138,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a smart contract that implements a simple auction system, where a user can bid on a token by sending Ether to the contract. The contract has a `bid` function that checks if the current bid is greater than the previous bid, and if so, it sends the previous bid to the current frontrunner and updates the current frontrunner and current bid. The contract also has a `BaseToken` contract that inherits from the `BaseToken` contract and has a `CustomToken` contract that inherits from the `BaseToken` contract. The `CustomToken` contract has a `totalSupply` variable that is set to 84000000000000000000000000, a `name` variable that is set to ""LiCoinGold"", a `symbol` variable that is set to ""LCGD"", and a `decimals` variable that is set to 18. The `balanceOf` mapping is also set to the address of the `CustomToken` contract. The `Transfer` event is also emitted.

Therefore, the given code is not vulnerable to any known smart contract vulnerabilities.",denial of service,1.0,669.0,6.0,2.5491039752960205
