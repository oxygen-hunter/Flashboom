126,reentrancy,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The `withdrawBalance` function is not calling any external contracts or using low-level functions with external addresses, so it is not susceptible to reentrancy attacks.",reentrancy,1.0,481.0,6.0,2.1598713397979736
127,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple contract that has a function called isSaleFinished() that returns true if the current block timestamp is greater than or equal to 1546300800. This function does not interact with any external contracts or tokens, and it does not have any modifiers that could potentially be exploited. Therefore, there is no vulnerability in this code.",time manipulation,1.0,513.0,6.0,2.0375430583953857
128,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a combination of two contracts, lottopollo and balanceChecker. The lottopollo contract is a smart contract that allows users to participate in a lottery by sending ether to the contract. The balanceChecker contract is a separate contract that allows users to check the balance of multiple addresses in a single transaction. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities.",time manipulation,1.0,516.0,6.0,2.731044054031372
129,time manipulation,"  NO, this code is not vulnerable. The code is using the `block.timestamp` to store the last investment timestamp, which is a critical value in the contract. The `block.timestamp` is a read-only value that is set by the miner when the block is mined, and it is not possible for an attacker to manipulate it. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.",time manipulation,1.0,515.0,6.0,3.1476755142211914
130,time manipulation,"  NO, this code is not vulnerable. The code is using the `now` keyword to get the current block timestamp, which is a secure way to get the current time. The `now` keyword is a constant that is set by the miner when they mine the block, and it is not possible for an attacker to manipulate it. Additionally, the code is using the `require` statement to check that the current block timestamp is different from the previous block timestamp, which is a secure way to check for reentrancy attacks.",time manipulation,1.0,540.0,6.0,3.571192741394043
131,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is using the `block.timestamp` to generate a random number, but it is not using it in a way that can be exploited. The `block.timestamp` is a deterministic value that is generated by the miner, and it is not used to manipulate the outcome of the random number generation. The code is using the `sha3` function to generate a random number, and the `uint` type to store the result. The `uint` type is not vulnerable to arithmetic overflows or underflows.

The code is also using the `assert` statement to check that the `msg.value` is equal to `TICKET_AMOUNT`, which ensures that the contract is only executed if the correct amount of ether is sent. The `assert` statement is used to check for conditions that are expected to be true, and it is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

The code is also using the `bank.transfer` function to transfer the `FEE_AMOUNT` to the `bank` address, and the `msg.sender.transfer` function to transfer the remaining amount to the `msg.sender` address. These functions are not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

The code is also using the `ERC20` contract to store the balance of the `addrs",time manipulation,2.0,697.0,6.0,1.80570387840271
132,short addresses,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a short address attack. The vulnerability lies in the `sendCoin` function, which uses the `msg.sender` address to retrieve the balance of the sender and then subtracts the amount from the sender's balance. However, the `msg.sender` address is not properly validated, which allows an attacker to send a specially crafted address that is shorter than the expected length. This can cause the `sendCoin` function to access an incorrect balance, leading to a security vulnerability.",short addresses,3.0,539.0,6.0,2.4934754371643066
133,denial of service,"  NO, this code is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The code is using the `address[]` data structure to store a list of addresses, and the `emptyCreditors` function is only modifying the length of the array, not the actual addresses. The `addCreditors` function is also only modifying the length of the array, and not the actual addresses. The `iWin` function is only returning the value of the `win` variable, which is not affected by the `emptyCreditors` function. The `numberCreditors` function is only returning the length of the array, which is not affected by the `emptyCreditors` function.

Therefore, this code is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack.",denial of service,3.0,586.0,6.0,2.2249011993408203
134,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a smart contract that implements a simple array of numbers and two functions to insert and clear the array. The contract does not use any external contracts or libraries, and it does not have any known vulnerabilities.",denial of service,1.0,487.0,6.0,2.0578622817993164
135,denial of service,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable. The code is written in Solidity, which is a statically typed language that compiles to a virtual machine. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an attacker.",denial of service,1.0,481.0,6.0,3.1722826957702637
136,denial of service,"  NO, this code is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The code is using the `require` function to check the return value of the `send` function, which ensures that the transaction is successful before continuing with the execution of the smart contract. Additionally, the `require` function is being used in a loop, which ensures that all transactions are successful before continuing with the execution of the smart contract. This means that the code is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack.",denial of service,1.0,533.0,6.0,2.122281789779663
137,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The code is a simple smart contract that has a single function, `ifillArray`, which fills an array with the sender's address if the array's length is less than 1500. The function returns true if the array is filled, and false otherwise. There is no way for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.",denial of service,1.0,521.0,6.0,2.210937738418579
138,denial of service,"  NO, this code is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to bid on a frontrunner in an auction. It has a single function, `bid()`, which requires a payment of at least the current bid amount and updates the current bid amount and frontrunner address. There is no way for an attacker to manipulate the contract's state or cause a denial of service attack through this code.",denial of service,1.0,527.0,6.0,2.1224727630615234
