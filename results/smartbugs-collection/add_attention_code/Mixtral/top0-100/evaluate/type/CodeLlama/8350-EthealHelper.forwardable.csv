The vulnerability lies in the `forwardable` function in the `EthealHelper` contract. The function calls the `getTx` function of the `iDeposit` contract, which in turn calls the `transactions` mapping of the `iDeposit` contract.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `getTx` function modifies the `cleared` field of the `Deposit` struct it retrieves.

130,time manipulation,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `forwardable` function in the `EthealHelper` contract.

This means that an attacker can pass any address as the `_deposit` parameter, which can lead to a reentrancy attack.

The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by calling the `forwardable` function with a malicious address that is not actually a valid address. The function will then try to access the `whitelist` mapping for that address, which will result in a revert. This can cause the contract to fail and lose all the funds that were deposited.

To fix this vulnerability, the `forwardable` function should check if the address is a valid address before accessing the `whitelist` mapping. This can be done by using the `address.isContract` function to check if the address is a valid contract address.
