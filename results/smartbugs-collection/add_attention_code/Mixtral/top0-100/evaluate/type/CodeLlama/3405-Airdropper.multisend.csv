The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function, which allows an external contract to call the `transfer` function of the `ERC20` contract, which in turn calls the `addToBalance` function of the `EtherBank` contract.

117,reentrancy,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The reason is that the `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract calls the `transfer` function of the `ERC20` contract, which can potentially make new calls to the `Airdropper` contract before the initial execution is complete.

132,short addresses,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a short address attack. The reason is that the `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract uses the `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function, which does not check the validity of the `to` address before transferring the tokens. This means that an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted `to` address that is shorter than the expected address length, causing the `transfer` function to fail and revert the transaction.",short addresses,3.0,539.0,6.0,3.5686991214752197
