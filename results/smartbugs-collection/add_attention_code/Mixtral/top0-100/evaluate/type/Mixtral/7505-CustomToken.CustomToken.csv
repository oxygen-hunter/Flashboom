136,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue lies in the Refunder contract's refundAll() function. The use of the require statement with the send() function call can cause the entire refund process to fail if one send() call fails. This can result in a denial of service, as all funds intended for refunds will be held up.",denial of service,3.0,504.0,6.0,4.771805047988892
137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the DosOneFunc contract's ifillArray function. The function allows any caller to add their address to the listAddresses array up to a length of 1500. This can be exploited to cause a denial of service attack by filling up the array with malicious addresses, preventing legitimate addresses from being added. In the given code, there is no check to ensure that only the contract owner can call the ifillArray function, making it open to anyone.",denial of service,3.0,538.0,6.0,2.579044818878174
138,denial of service," NO. The given smart contract code does not appear to be vulnerable to denial of service attacks as there is no function call that could potentially be used for such an attack in the provided code. The code creates a new token contract ""CustomToken"" that initializes with a total supply and assigns it to a specific address. There is no interaction with external contracts or functions that could be exploited for a denial of service attack.",denial of service,1.0,518.0,6.0,2.759896278381348
