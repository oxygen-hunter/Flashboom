135,denial of service," YES, The vulnerability lies in lines 46 and 48 where the contract resets the 'creditorAddresses' and 'creditorAmounts' arrays to empty after each transaction. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the 'lendGovernmentMoney' function and drain the contract of funds by repeatedly creating new entries in these arrays without actually lending any money. This is a denial of service attack as it allows the attacker to prevent the contract from functioning properly.",denial of service,3.0,524.0,6.0,2.848237991333008
136,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the Refunder contract's refundAll() function. The use of the require statement with the send function call in a loop can cause the entire contract to be held hostage if one send() call fails. This can result in a denial of service attack. In the given code, the Refunder contract is sending all funds to the refundAddresses array, and if one address fails to receive the funds, the entire contract will be held hostage, preventing the remaining refunds from being processed.",denial of service,3.0,542.0,6.0,4.099818706512451
137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the DosOneFunc contract's ifillArray function. The function allows any address to add their address to the listAddresses array up to a length of 1500. Once the length limit is reached, the array is reset to an empty array. This can be exploited to perform a Denial of Service attack by repeatedly calling the ifillArray function and filling up the array, effectively denying access to the contract for other addresses.",denial of service,3.0,533.0,6.0,4.655286312103272
138,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the previous question. The vulnerability in the previous question was related to a require statement that included a call to the send function, which can be used for denial of service attacks.

The given smart contract code does not include any such vulnerabilities. It is a simple contract that creates a new token with a specified total supply and initializes the balance of a specific address with that total supply. It does not include any functionality that could be exploited for denial of service attacks.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",denial of service,1.0,549.0,6.0,2.9087469577789307
