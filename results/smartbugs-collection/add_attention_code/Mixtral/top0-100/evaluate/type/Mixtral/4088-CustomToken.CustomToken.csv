77,arithmetic," The given smart contract code is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the previous code snippet. However, I can evaluate the given code for potential vulnerabilities.

The code defines a contract `CustomToken` that inherits from `BaseToken`. The `CustomToken` constructor initializes the `totalSupply` and sets the balance of a specific address to the total supply. It also emits a `Transfer` event.

Based on the given code, there are no obvious vulnerabilities. However, it's important to note that the constructor's behavior is not idiomatic in Solidity. Instead, it's recommended to use the `constructor` keyword to initialize state variables and the `.` notation to access them.

Here's a refactored version of the code:

```solidity

contract BaseToken {
    uint256 public totalSupply;
    mapping (address => uint256) public balanceOf;

The use of the require statement with the send() function call can cause the entire refund process to fail if one send() call fails. This can result in a denial of service, as all funds will be held up until the failed send() call is resolved.",denial of service,3.0,509.0,6.0,3.631505966186523
137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the DosOneFunc contract's ifillArray function. The function allows any caller to add their address to the listAddresses array up to a length of 1500. This can be exploited to cause a denial of service attack by filling up the array with malicious addresses, preventing legitimate addresses from being added. In the given code, there is no check to ensure that only the contract owner can call the ifillArray function, making it open to anyone.",denial of service,3.0,538.0,6.0,2.846700429916382
138,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the previous question. The vulnerability in the previous question was related to a denial of service attack, which is not present in the given code.

The given code is a contract named ""CustomToken"" that inherits from a contract named ""BaseToken"". The ""CustomToken"" contract sets the initial total supply of tokens and assigns them to a specific address. The ""BaseToken"" contract includes a mapping of addresses to their token balances and an event for tracking token transfers.

There is no vulnerability in the given code.",denial of service,1.0,551.0,6.0,3.213003396987915
