12,access control," Yes, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the fact that the `missing` function in the `Missing` contract sets the `owner` address to the `msg.sender` without any checks.

In the given code, this vulnerability is exploited in the `CustomToken` contract where the `totalSupply` is assigned to an arbitrary address during contract creation.",access control,3.0,531.0,6.0,4.783594131469727

17,access control," Yes, the Proxy contract is vulnerable. The issue is with the use of `delegatecall` in the `forward` function. This function forwards messages to another contract (callee) and delegates the execution to that contract. However, it does not perform any checks on the callee's return value, which can lead to unintended consequences, including the execution of malicious code.

23,access control," Yes, the SimpleSuicide contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is that the function `sudicideAnyone()` allows any address to call it and destroy the contract, including the contract's creator's address.

25,access control," Yes, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

This can be exploited to deny service to other users by repeatedly calling the ""emptyCreditors"" function and setting the ""win"" variable to true. In the given code, there are no access controls or gas limits on the ""emptyCreditors"" function, making it easy for an attacker to exploit. In the ""CustomToken"" contract, the vulnerability does not directly affect its functionality, but the ""DosGas"" contract is still vulnerable and could potentially be used to cause denial of service to other smart contracts or users.",denial of service,3.0,594.0,6.0,3.8650577068328857
134,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to denial of service attacks based on the provided code snippet. The vulnerability in the previous code was due to the contract not checking the array's length before appending new elements, allowing an attacker to consume all available memory and cause a denial of service. However, in the given code, the contract checks if the number of elements is equal to the array's length before appending new elements, preventing the denial of service vulnerability.",denial of service,3.0,528.0,6.0,3.1472809314727783
135,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not the same as the one in the previous question. The new code is a different contract named ""CustomToken"" that inherits from the ""BaseToken"" contract. Based on the provided code, this contract does not appear to be vulnerable to the denial of service attack mentioned in the previous question. The vulnerability in the previous question was due to the contract's ability to clear its state variables, including the array of creditor addresses and amounts, after each transaction. In contrast, the ""CustomToken"" contract does not have this vulnerability as it does not clear its state variables in the same way. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",denial of service,1.0,568.0,6.0,4.4013965129852295
136,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue lies in the Refunder contract's refundAll() function. The use of the require statement with the send() function call can cause the entire refund process to fail if one transaction fails. This can result in a denial of service, as all funds will be held up until the failed transaction is resolved. In the given code, there is no mechanism to handle or bypass failed transactions, making the contract vulnerable to this type of attack.",denial of service,3.0,531.0,6.0,3.26183557510376
137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the DosOneFunc contract's ifillArray function. The function allows any caller to add their address to the listAddresses array up to a length of 1500. This can be exploited to cause a denial of service attack by filling up the array with malicious addresses, preventing legitimate addresses from being added. In the given code, there is no check to ensure that only the contract owner can call the ifillArray function, making it open to anyone.",denial of service,3.0,538.0,6.0,3.090584278106689
138,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the previous question. The vulnerability in the previous question was related to a denial of service attack, which is not present in the given code.

The given code is a contract named ""CustomToken"" that inherits from a contract named ""BaseToken"". The ""CustomToken"" contract sets the initial total supply of tokens and assigns them to a specific address. The ""BaseToken"" contract includes a mapping of addresses to their token balances and an event for tracking token transfers.

There is no vulnerability in the given code.",denial of service,1.0,551.0,6.0,3.069838285446167
