By setting the ""creditorAddresses"" array to an empty array and setting the ""win"" variable to true, the contract effectively denies service to all other users by clearing the list of creditor addresses and making the ""iWin"" function return true. This can be exploited to prevent other users from interacting with the contract.",denial of service,3.0,525.0,6.0,3.160450935363769
134,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to denial of service attacks based on the provided code snippet. The vulnerability in the previous code was related to the dynamic array resizing, which is not present in this code. Instead, this code creates a new array with a fixed length during contract initialization.",denial of service,1.0,493.0,6.0,2.748234748840332
135,denial of service," YES, The vulnerability lies in lines 46 and 48 where the contract resets the 'creditorAddresses' and 'creditorAmounts' arrays to empty after each transaction. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the 'lendGovernmentMoney' function and drain the contract of funds by repeatedly creating new entries in these arrays without actually lending any money. This is a denial of service attack as it allows the attacker to prevent the contract from functioning properly.",denial of service,3.0,524.0,6.0,3.091629266738892
136,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the Refunder contract's refundAll() function. The use of the require statement with the send function call in a loop can cause the entire contract's funds to be held if one send call fails. This can result in a denial of service attack. In the given code, the BaseToken and CustomToken contracts are not related to the vulnerability, but the Refunder contract is vulnerable as described.",denial of service,3.0,526.0,6.0,3.263388395309448
137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the DosOneFunc contract's ifillArray function. The function allows any address to add their address to the listAddresses array up to a length of 1500. Once the length of the array reaches 1500, the array is reset to an empty array. This can be exploited to perform a Denial of Service attack by repeatedly calling the ifillArray function and filling up the array, causing the contract to consume excessive gas and potentially denying service to other users.",denial of service,3.0,542.0,6.0,3.593580484390259
138,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the previous question. The vulnerability in the previous question was related to a require statement that included a call to the send function, which can be used for denial of service attacks.

The given smart contract code does not include any such vulnerabilities. It is a simple contract that creates a new token with a specified name, symbol, and decimal value, and initializes the total supply and assigns it to a specific address. It does not include any functionality that could be exploited for denial of service attacks.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",denial of service,1.0,555.0,6.0,4.422522306442261
