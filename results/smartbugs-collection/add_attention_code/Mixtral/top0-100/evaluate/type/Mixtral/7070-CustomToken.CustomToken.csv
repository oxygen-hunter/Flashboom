This means that the creator of the contract has complete control over the token supply and can distribute it as they see fit. This is a potential security risk and goes against the principle of decentralization.

Therefore, while the code is not vulnerable to the short address attack, it does have other potential vulnerabilities that should be addressed.",short addresses,2.0,573.0,6.0,1.9930496215820312
133,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the ""DosGas"" contract's ""emptyCreditors"" function. By setting the ""creditorAddresses"" array to an empty array and setting the ""win"" variable to true, the contract effectively denies service to all other users by clearing the list of creditor addresses and making the ""iWin"" function return true. This can be exploited to prevent other users from interacting with the contract.",denial of service,3.0,525.0,6.0,3.704480409622192
134,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to denial of service attacks based on the provided code snippet. The vulnerability in the previous code was due to the lack of checks on the array's length before appending new elements, allowing an attacker to consume all available memory and cause a denial of service. However, in the given code, the contract ""CustomToken"" is derived from the ""BaseToken"" contract, and the ""insertNnumbers"" function is not present in the given code. Therefore, there is no vulnerability to denial of service attacks in the given code.",denial of service,1.0,549.0,6.0,4.022200107574463
135,denial of service," YES, The vulnerability lies in lines 46 and 48 where the contract resets the 'creditorAddresses' and 'creditorAmounts' arrays to empty arrays after each transaction. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the 'lendGovernmentMoney' function and drain the contract of funds by repeatedly creating new entries in the arrays without actually lending any money. This is a classic denial of service attack.",denial of service,3.0,514.0,6.0,2.708770036697388
136,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the Refunder contract's refundAll() function. The use of the require statement with the send function call in a loop can cause the entire contract's funds to be held if one send call fails. This can result in a denial of service attack. In the given code, the BaseToken and CustomToken contracts are not related to the vulnerability, but the Refunder contract is vulnerable as described.",denial of service,3.0,526.0,6.0,2.6343679428100586
137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the DosOneFunc contract's ifillArray function. The function allows any address to add their address to the listAddresses array up to a length of 1500. Once the length limit is reached, the array is reset to an empty array. This can be exploited to perform a denial of service attack by repeatedly calling the ifillArray function and filling up the array, causing the contract to consume excessive gas and potentially denying service to other users.",denial of service,3.0,537.0,6.0,4.241392850875855
138,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the previous question. The vulnerability in the previous question was related to a require statement that included a call to the send function, which can be used for denial of service attacks.

The given smart contract code does not include any such vulnerabilities. It is a simple contract that creates a new token with a specified name, symbol, decimals, and total supply, and initializes the balance of the contract creator address to the total supply. It does not include any functions that can be used for denial of service attacks.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",denial of service,1.0,558.0,6.0,3.11927342414856
