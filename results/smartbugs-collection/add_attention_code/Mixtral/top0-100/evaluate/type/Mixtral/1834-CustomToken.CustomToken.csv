3. The event name in the Transfer event should be defined using the 'keywords' notation instead of the'string' notation to ensure compatibility with future Solidity versions.

The vulnerability in the previous code was due to the lack of checks on the array's length before appending new elements, allowing an attacker to consume all available memory and cause a denial of service. However, in the given code, the contract ""CustomToken"" is derived from the ""BaseToken"" contract, and the ""insertNnumbers"" function is not present in the given code. Therefore, there is no vulnerability to denial of service attacks in the given code.",denial of service,1.0,549.0,6.0,2.368464708328247
135,denial of service," YES, The vulnerability lies in lines 46 and 48 where the contract resets the 'creditorAddresses' and 'creditorAmounts' arrays to empty after each transaction. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the 'lendGovernmentMoney' function and drain the contract of funds by repeatedly creating new entries in these arrays without actually lending any money. This is a classic denial of service attack.",denial of service,3.0,513.0,6.0,3.945389032363892
136,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the Refunder contract's refundAll() function. The use of the require statement with the send function call in a loop can cause the entire contract to be held hostage if one send() call fails. This can result in a denial of service attack. In the given code, the Refunder contract is not checking for the success of the send() function call before moving on to the next address in the loop, making it vulnerable to this type of attack.",denial of service,3.0,538.0,6.0,3.7283334732055664
137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the DosOneFunc contract's ifillArray function. The function allows any address to add their address to the listAddresses array up to a length of 1500. Once the length limit is reached, the array is reset to an empty array. This can be exploited to perform a Denial of Service attack by repeatedly calling the ifillArray function and filling up the array, causing the contract to consume excessive gas and potentially denying service to other users. In the given code, there is no check to prevent repeated calls to the ifillArray function, making it vulnerable to this type of attack.",denial of service,3.0,567.0,6.0,2.931661367416382
138,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the previous question. The vulnerability in the previous question was related to a require statement that included a call to the send function, which can be used for denial of service attacks.

The given smart contract code does not include any such vulnerabilities. It is a simple contract that creates a new token with a specified name, symbol, decimals, and total supply, and initializes the balance of a specific address with the total supply. It does not include any functionality that could be exploited for denial of service attacks.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",denial of service,1.0,557.0,6.0,2.916491746902466
