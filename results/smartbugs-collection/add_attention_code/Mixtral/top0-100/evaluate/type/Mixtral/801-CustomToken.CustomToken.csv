134,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to denial of service attacks based on the provided code snippet. The vulnerability in the previous code was due to the lack of checks on the array's length before appending new elements, allowing an attacker to consume all available memory and cause a denial of service. However, in the given code, the contract ""CustomToken"" initializes the array with a fixed length and does not have a function similar to ""insertNnumbers"" that could be exploited for a denial of service attack.",denial of service,1.0,538.0,6.0,4.578356981277466
135,denial of service," YES, The vulnerability lies in lines 46 and 48 where the contract resets the 'creditorAddresses' and 'creditorAmounts' arrays to empty after each transaction. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the 'lendGovernmentMoney' function and drain the contract of funds by repeatedly creating new entries in these arrays without actually lending any money. This is a denial of service attack as it allows the attacker to prevent the contract from functioning properly.",denial of service,3.0,524.0,6.0,2.07995343208313
136,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the Refunder contract's refundAll() function. The use of the require statement with the send function call in a loop can cause the entire contract to be held hostage if one send() call fails. This can result in a denial of service attack. In the given code, the Refunder contract is sending all funds to the refundAddresses array, and if one address fails to receive the funds, the entire contract will be held hostage, preventing the remaining refunds from being processed.",denial of service,3.0,542.0,6.0,2.520908832550049
137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the DosOneFunc contract's ifillArray function. The function allows any address to add their address to the listAddresses array up to a length of 1500. Once the length limit is reached, the array is reset to an empty array. This can be exploited to perform a Denial of Service attack by repeatedly calling the ifillArray function and filling up the array, causing the contract to consume excessive gas and potentially denying service to other users.",denial of service,3.0,538.0,6.0,6.386757135391235
138,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the previous question. The vulnerability in the previous question was related to a require statement that included a call to the send function, which can be used for denial of service attacks.

The given smart contract code does not include any such vulnerabilities. It is a simple contract that creates a new token with a specified name, symbol, and total supply, and assigns all tokens to a single address. There are no functions that can be called by external parties, and there are no require statements that include calls to external functions. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",denial of service,1.0,560.0,6.0,3.728733777999878
