This modification ensures that the contract continues to the next address only if the previous transfer was successful.",denial of service,3.0,597.0,6.0,3.731812953948975
137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the ""ifillArray()"" function. The function allows any address to add their address to the ""listAddresses"" array up to 350 times, which can lead to a Denial of Service attack by consuming a large amount of gas or storage. Additionally, the contract does not check the amount of ether sent in the ""pay()"" function, which can also be exploited for a Denial of Service attack by sending large amounts of ether to the contract.",denial of service,4.0,538.0,6.0,4.244683742523193
138,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the 'pay' function where the contract transfers all its funds to the caller if 'c' equals 2. This can be exploited by an attacker to drain the contract of funds. Additionally, the 'bid' function still contains the vulnerable'require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid))' line which can be used for a denial of service attack as explained in the previous example.",denial of service,4.0,525.0,6.0,3.749011039733887
