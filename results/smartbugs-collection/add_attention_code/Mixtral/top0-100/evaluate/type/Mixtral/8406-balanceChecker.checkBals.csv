11,access control," Yes, the code is vulnerable. The issue lies in the `newOwner` function in the `MultiOwnable` contract. The function allows any address to set a new owner for another address, as long as the new owner is not the zero address. This can be exploited by an attacker to take control of other accounts. In the `TestContract` contract, the `withdrawAll` function can be used to drain the balance of the contract, and an attacker can use the `newOwner` function to set themselves as the new owner and then call `withdrawAll`.",access control,3.0,551.0,6.0,5.48524284362793
12,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is in the `missing()` function of the `Missing` contract. In this function, the `owner` variable is being set to the `msg.sender` address, which means that anyone can call this function and become the owner of the contract. This bypasses the intended access control mechanism provided by the `onlyowner` modifier.

14,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function in the `Wallet` contract. The `require` statement in line 13 checks if the amount to be withdrawn is greater than or equal to the current balance of the sender. However, this check is performed after the funds have been transferred from the contract to the sender. This means that if an attacker is able to call the `withdraw` function with an amount greater than their current balance, they will be able to drain the contract of funds before the balance check fails.

Additionally, the `migrateTo` function in the `Wallet` contract is also vulnerable to access control attacks. The `require` statement in line 35 checks if the caller is the contract creator. However, this check is performed after the funds have been transferred to the new contract address. This means that an attacker could call the `migrateTo` function with the contract creator's address and drain the contract of funds before the check fails.

The `checkBals` function in the `balanceChecker` contract does not directly interact with the `Wallet` contract and is not vulnerable on its own. However, it could be used as part of an attack on the `Wallet` contract, so it is important to ensure that it is used securely.

In the given code snippet, there is no additional check on the constructor call, so anyone can call it and become the owner, allowing them to call the ""withdraw"" function and drain the contract of funds.",access control,3.0,540.0,6.0,3.7365236282348633
16,access control," The given smart contract code is not the one being audited in the previous question. The previous question was about a simple contract named ""Map"" with a vulnerability related to access control.

The given code consists of three contracts: ""Map"", ""ERC20"", and ""balanceChecker"". The ""Map"" contract is the same as in the previous question, and it is not vulnerable on its own. The ""ERC20"" contract is a common ERC-20 token standard contract, and it is not vulnerable either.

The ""balanceChecker"" contract, however, has a potential vulnerability. The contract's ""checkBals"" function iterates through an array of addresses and calls the ""balanceOf"" function of the ""ERC20"" contract for each address. It stores the returned balance in a local array and then returns it.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the ""checkBals"" function is marked as ""public"" and ""view"", meaning that anyone can call it and see the balances of all addresses in the array. This can be a privacy issue, as the balances of all addresses in the array are exposed. It is not a security vulnerability, but it can still be a concern for those who value their privacy.

Therefore, the answer is: 'Yes, it is vulnerable to privacy issues'.",access control,2.0,697.0,6.0,2.6384310722351074

73,front running," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks. The vulnerability lies in the `claimReward` function in the `EthTxOrderDependenceMinimal` contract, where the contract transfers the reward to the caller before marking the claim as processed. This allows a malicious user to preempt the original claim by submitting a higher-priced transaction and claiming the reward before the original caller.

In the `checkBals` function of the `balanceChecker` contract, there is no vulnerability as it is just a view function and does not modify the contract state.",front running,3.0,545.0,6.0,3.522819757461548
74,front running," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the interaction between the FindThisHash contract and the external ERC20 contract. Since the solution function in FindThisHash does not check the gas price or gas limit of the incoming transaction, a malicious user can front-run the solution submission by calling the ERC20 contract's balanceOf function with a higher gas price and then submitting the solution with a lower gas price. This would allow the malicious user to obtain the solution before the original submitter and claim the reward.",front running,3.0,538.0,6.0,3.7256345748901367
75,front running, NO. The given smart contract code is not vulnerable based on the provided information.

76,front running," Based on the given code, the smart contract is not vulnerable to the described front-running attack. The vulnerability in the original code was that the contract allowed users to submit a number and pay a fee to join a game, and the winner was determined based on the sum of the numbers submitted by the two players. In this case, a malicious user could front-run the transaction of another user by submitting a higher fee and submitting their number before the other user, thus winning the game.

However, in the given code, there is no such functionality that would allow for front-running attacks. The code defines a contract `balanceChecker` that has a function `checkBals` which returns the balance of multiple addresses in an ERC20 contract. This contract does not have any functionality that would allow for front-running attacks as described in the original question.",front running,1.0,602.0,6.0,3.836090326309204
77,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is in the `init` function of the `IntegerOverflowMappingSym1` contract. The line `map[k] -= v;` can result in an arithmetic underflow or overflow, depending on the values of `k` and `v`. This can lead to unintended behavior or security vulnerabilities. In the given context, it is not clear how this contract is being used, but the potential for vulnerabilities exists.

The `balanceChecker` contract does not directly interact with the `IntegerOverflowMappingSym1` contract, so it is not directly affected by this vulnerability. However, it is always important to ensure that all contracts used in a smart contract system are secure and free of vulnerabilities.",arithmetic,3.0,581.0,6.0,5.936607122421265
78,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is in the `run` function of the `IntegerOverflowMul` contract. Multiplying an unsigned integer by another unsigned integer can result in an integer overflow, leading to incorrect or unexpected contract behavior. In this case, the `count` variable may become very large, consuming excessive gas and potentially causing the contract to fail to execute properly. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the contract or drain its funds.

The `balanceChecker` contract does not directly interact with the `IntegerOverflowMul` contract, so it is not vulnerable on its own. However, if it is used in conjunction with the `IntegerOverflowMul` contract, it could be affected by the vulnerability if it calls the `run` function with a large enough input.",arithmetic,4.0,592.0,6.0,4.472189664840698
79,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is not directly in the Overflow_Add contract, but in the balanceChecker contract. In the for loop in the checkBals function, the balanceOf function is called without checking for potential overflows. This means that if the sum of the balances of all addresses in the addrs array exceeds the maximum representable value of a uint256, an integer overflow will occur and the contract behavior will be undefined. This can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities or incorrect contract state.",arithmetic,3.0,536.0,6.0,2.5870039463043213
80,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is similar to the one in the first contract. In this case, the vulnerability is in the `balanceChecker` contract's `checkBals` function.

This can result in incorrect balances being returned and potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate the contract.",arithmetic,3.0,534.0,6.0,5.701489210128784
81,arithmetic," The given smart contract code is not the TimeLock contract that was previously discussed. The provided code consists of three separate contracts: TimeLock, ERC20, and balanceChecker.

Since the TimeLock contract is not present in the given code, it is not vulnerable to the arithmetic overflow vulnerability that was previously discussed.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",arithmetic,1.0,504.0,6.0,4.911534786224365
82,arithmetic," YES, the vulnerability lies in the buy function in the TokenSaleChallenge contract. The require statement in line 23 checks if msg.value (the amount of ether sent by the caller) is equal to numTokens \* PRICE\_PER\_TOKEN. However, this check does not take into account the possibility of an integer overflow, which can occur if numTokens is large enough. If an integer overflow occurs, the value of numTokens will wrap around and become a much smaller number, causing the require statement to fail even if the caller has sent the correct amount of ether. This can allow an attacker to buy fewer tokens than intended, or even buy tokens for free if the contract balance is low enough.

Additionally, the sell function also has a similar vulnerability in the require statement on line 28, which checks if balanceOf[msg.sender] >= numTokens. If an integer underflow occurs, the value of balanceOf[msg.sender] can become a much larger number, causing the require statement to fail even if the caller has enough tokens to sell. This can prevent the caller from selling their tokens, or even cause them to lose their tokens if the contract balance is low enough.

Therefore, it is recommended to use SafeMath library or other arithmetic libraries to prevent integer overflows and underflows in smart contracts.",arithmetic,3.0,697.0,6.0,4.428866863250732
83,arithmetic," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to arithmetic overflows.

This can potentially be exploited to steal funds or cause denial of service.",arithmetic,3.0,527.0,6.0,3.04599928855896
85,arithmetic," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is similar to the one in the previous code snippet.

This can result in the ""count"" variable holding an incorrect value, which can lead to unintended contract behavior or security vulnerabilities. In the given code snippet, the vulnerability is not directly exploited, but it is present and could be exploited in other ways.

In the context of the additional code snippet provided, the ""balanceChecker"" contract does not directly interact with the ""IntegerOverflowMultiTxOneFuncFeasible"" contract, so it is not directly affected by the vulnerability.

87,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the 'transfer' function of the 'Token' contract. The'require' statement in line 11 checks if the sender's balance is greater than or equal to the value being transferred. However, the balance is subtracted from the sender's account after the'require' statement, which can lead to an integer underflow if the balance is not sufficient. This can result in the contract continuing execution even if the balance is insufficient, allowing the attacker to transfer more tokens than they have.",arithmetic,3.0,543.0,6.0,2.4769041538238525
88,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract `IntegerOverflowAdd` is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the integer overflow that occurs when `count` is added with a large value of `input`. This can lead to incorrect contract behavior or even allow an attacker to drain the contract of funds.",arithmetic,3.0,489.0,6.0,3.138953924179077
89,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is not directly related to the Overflow contract, but rather to the interaction between the Overflow contract and the ERC20 contract. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the Overflow contract does not check for arithmetic overflows when adding values to the sellerBalance variable. In the context of the given code, this means that if the sum of the sellerBalance and the value being added exceeds the maximum representable value for a uint256, the result will be an incorrect value, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities or incorrect contract behavior.

In the given code, the Overflow contract's add function is being used as a part of the balanceChecker contract's checkBals function. When the balanceChecker contract calls the add function of the Overflow contract, an arithmetic overflow can occur if the value being added is large enough. This can lead to incorrect balance values being returned by the checkBals function, potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate the contract's state or steal funds.

Therefore, it is important to always check for arithmetic overflows and underflows in smart contracts, especially when dealing with financial transactions or sensitive data. One way to prevent arithmetic overflows is to use SafeMath libraries, which provide safe arithmetic operations that automatically revert the transaction if an overflow occurs. Another approach is to manually",arithmetic,4.0,696.0,6.0,2.7919015884399414
90,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is similar to the one in the previous example. In the function `transfer` of the contract `IntegerOverflowAdd`, the line `balanceOf[_to] += _value;` can cause an integer overflow if the new balance of `_to` exceeds the maximum value of a `uint256`. This can lead to incorrect contract behavior or even security vulnerabilities. In the contract `balanceChecker`, the function `checkBals` is not directly related to the vulnerability, but it uses the contract `ERC20` which has the vulnerable `transfer` function. Therefore, the contract `balanceChecker` is indirectly vulnerable as well.",arithmetic,3.0,569.0,6.0,3.080847978591919

94,bad randomness," Yes, the Lottery contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of block number as a source of randomness to determine if a bet has won. This is not secure as the block number can be predicted. In the given code snippet, the contract checks if the current block number is even to determine if a bet has won. An attacker can easily predict the next block number and manipulate the contract accordingly. This can lead to bets being paid out to the attacker even if they haven't made a bet.

127,time manipulation," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `TimedCrowdsale` contract's `isSaleFinished()` function, which relies on the `block.timestamp` value, which can be manipulated by miners. This vulnerability was already explained in the previous example.",time manipulation,3.0,489.0,6.0,5.348368406295776
128,time manipulation," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the use of `block.timestamp` in the `randomGen()` function and the `payOut()` function's condition `now - rand > 24 hours`. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `block.timestamp` value can be manipulated by miners, allowing them to potentially exploit the contract.",time manipulation,3.0,502.0,6.0,2.9255237579345703
129,time manipulation," YES, the vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` in the `lastInvestmentTimestamp` variable in the `invest()` function. This can be manipulated by miners, allowing them to potentially reset the investment earlier than intended.",time manipulation,3.0,480.0,6.0,4.568750143051148
130,time manipulation," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of `now` in the `Roulette` contract without proper consideration of its potential manipulation by miners. In the `checkBals` function of the `balanceChecker` contract, it is not directly related to the vulnerability and is safe. However, the vulnerability exists in the `Roulette` contract and can be exploited by an attacker to drain the contract's funds.",time manipulation,3.0,523.0,6.0,3.1325700283050537
131,time manipulation," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the use of block.timestamp in generating random numbers. The block timestamp can be manipulated by miners, and using it to generate random numbers can lead to predictable outcomes and potential vulnerabilities.",time manipulation,3.0,478.0,6.0,3.633775234222412
132,short addresses," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The `sendCoin` function does not include any checks or modifications to the contract state between the balance check and the balance update, allowing an attacker to call another contract function or transaction that alters the contract state before the balance update is recorded. This can result in the attacker receiving more tokens than they should be able to. To mitigate this vulnerability, consider using the `.` notation to access the contract state instead of using the `balanceOf` function, or implementing a check-then-act pattern to ensure that the contract state is updated only after all necessary checks have been performed.",short addresses,2.0,562.0,6.0,2.9091084003448486
133,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `emptyCreditors()` function in the `DosGas` contract. The function checks if the length of `creditorAddresses` is greater than 1500, and if so, it resets the array to an empty one and sets the `win` variable to true. This means that an attacker can repeatedly call the `emptyCreditors()` function to reset the `creditorAddresses` array and prevent new addresses from being added, effectively denying service to the contract.

In the `balanceChecker` contract, there is no vulnerability found.",denial of service,3.0,556.0,6.0,3.3101134300231934
134,denial of service," Based on the given code, the smart contract ""balanceChecker"" is not vulnerable to denial of service attacks as described in the provided code for ""DosNumber"" contract. The ""balanceChecker"" contract only has a read-only function ""checkBals"" which returns the balance of multiple addresses in an ERC20 contract. It does not have any write functionality or state variables that can be manipulated to cause a denial of service attack.",denial of service,1.0,521.0,6.0,2.240623712539673
135,denial of service," Based on the given code, the smart contract ""Government"" is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the lines where the arrays ""creditorAddresses"" and ""creditorAmounts"" are being reset to empty arrays after each transaction. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the ""lendGovernmentMoney"" function and drain the contract of funds. This is a classic denial of service attack.",denial of service,3.0,510.0,6.0,2.874328851699829
136,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue lies in the Refunder contract's refundAll() function. The use of the require statement with the send() function call can cause the entire function to fail if any single send() call fails. This can result in a denial of service, as all funds will be held up until the issue is resolved. In the given code, there is no mechanism to handle or recover from failed send() calls, making the contract vulnerable to this type of attack.",denial of service,3.0,535.0,6.0,3.95321536064148
137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `DosOneFunc` contract's `ifillArray()` function. The function allows any caller to add their address to the `listAddresses` array up to 350 times, which can lead to a denial of service attack by consuming all available gas or storage. In the given example, the `balanceChecker` contract is not related to the vulnerability and is not affected.",denial of service,3.0,523.0,6.0,1.920639991760254
138,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `DosAuction` contract's `bid()` function, specifically the line `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));`. This line calls the `send()` function of the `currentFrontrunner` address, which can potentially be an attacker. If the `send()` function call fails (for example, if the `currentFrontrunner` address has insufficient funds), the transaction will be reverted, but the `DosAuction` contract will continue executing, potentially allowing the attacker to cause a denial of service by repeatedly calling the `bid()` function and draining the contract of funds.

Additionally, the `balanceChecker` contract does not seem to be related to the vulnerability in the `DosAuction` contract, so it does not affect the vulnerability assessment.",denial of service,3.0,602.0,6.0,4.3859264850616455
