12,access control," Yes, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the initialization of the `CustomToken` contract in its constructor, which sets the initial balance of a specific address to the total supply of tokens. This can lead to the initializer having control over a large number of tokens, which can be exploited. In this case, the initializer is hardcoded into the contract, but in a real-world scenario, it could be an attacker. This is a violation of the principle of ""no initializer should be trusted with a large amount of tokens.""

20,access control," Yes, the Wallet contract is vulnerable due to the lack of proper access control in the initWallet function.

22,access control," Yes, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the constructor of the CustomToken contract where the total supply of tokens is hardcoded and assigned to a specific address.

23,access control," Yes, the SimpleSuicide contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is that the function `sudicideAnyone()` allows any address to call it and destroy the contract, including the contract's creator's address. This is a problem because it allows any address to take control of the contract and potentially steal funds or manipulate its state. In the case of the SimpleSuicide contract, this vulnerability can be exploited to destroy the contract and lose all of its funds.

The CustomToken contract, on the other hand, is not vulnerable in the same way. The vulnerability in the SimpleSuicide contract is specific to its design and functionality, whereas the CustomToken contract is a derivative of the BaseToken contract and does not have the same vulnerability. The CustomToken contract does have other potential vulnerabilities, such as the hardcoded initial total supply and the lack of access control for the `balanceOf` mapping, but those are not directly related to the vulnerability in the SimpleSuicide contract.",access control,4.0,628.0,6.0,2.858222723007202

76,front running," The given smart contract code is not directly vulnerable to the front-running attack described in the previous question. However, the `CustomToken` contract has a hardcoded address that receives all the tokens during its construction. This can be considered a security risk, as the contract's state is not determined by its users' interactions but by its initial deployment.

The vulnerability described earlier in the question, where the contract's state is influenced by the order of transactions in the block, is not present in this code. The `play` function in the `OddsAndEvens` contract checks that the user sends exactly 1 ether, and the contract's state is updated only after both players have made their moves.

However, it's important to note that there may be other vulnerabilities or design issues in the code that are not related to the front-running attack. For example, the `andTheWinnerIs` function is marked as `private`, but it appears to be modifying the contract's state and sending ether to the winner. It's not clear why this function should be private, and it may be better to make it public or to find another way to ensure that only the contract owner can call it. Additionally, the contract does not include any checks on the input number, so a user could potentially call the `play` function with any number they want.

This means that the contract is not following the intended distribution of tokens and can be controlled by an attacker.

Therefore, the answer is 'YES', but the vulnerability is not related to the short address attack. Instead, it is due to the constructor function not following the intended distribution of tokens.",short addresses,2.0,570.0,6.0,1.9117143154144287
133,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the ""DosGas"" contract's ""emptyCreditors"" function. By setting the ""creditorAddresses"" array to an empty array, the contract effectively resets the state, including the ""win"" variable. This can be exploited to deny service to other users by repeatedly calling the ""emptyCreditors"" function and setting the ""win"" variable to true. In the given code, there is no check to prevent this from happening multiple times, making it a denial of service vulnerability.",denial of service,3.0,544.0,6.0,2.898874282836914
134,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not directly vulnerable to denial of service attacks based on the provided code. However, the `CustomToken` contract has a hardcoded address with total supply, which can be considered a security risk if the private key of that address is compromised. It is recommended to use a secure and decentralized method to initialize the total supply, such as using a constructor function with a payable modifier and setting the total supply as an argument.",denial of service,2.0,524.0,6.0,2.4236910343170166
135,denial of service," The given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the lines where the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays are being reset to empty arrays:

```solidity
creditorAddresses = new address[](0);
creditorAmounts = new uint[](0);
```

These lines cause the loss of all previously stored data in these arrays, effectively denying service to any previous creditors. This can be exploited to prevent new creditors from receiving funds, as the contract will only process new transactions if a certain amount of time has passed since the last transaction. This vulnerability can be exploited to perform a denial of service attack.",denial of service,3.0,562.0,6.0,2.906297445297241
136,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue lies in the Refunder contract's refundAll() function. The use of the require statement with the send() function call can cause the entire refund process to fail if one send() call fails. This can result in a denial of service, as all funds intended for refunds will be held up.",denial of service,3.0,504.0,6.0,3.233348608016968
137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the DosOneFunc contract's ifillArray function. The function allows any caller to add their address to the listAddresses array up to a length of 1500. This can be exploited to cause a denial of service attack by filling up the array with malicious addresses, preventing legitimate addresses from being added. In the given code, there is no check to ensure that only the contract owner can call the ifillArray function, making it open to anyone.",denial of service,3.0,538.0,6.0,2.9645931720733643
138,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the previous question. The vulnerability in the previous question was related to a denial of service attack, which is not present in the given code.

The given code is a contract named ""CustomToken"" that inherits from a contract named ""BaseToken"". The ""CustomToken"" contract sets the initial total supply of tokens and assigns them to a specific address. The ""BaseToken"" contract includes a mapping of addresses to their token balances and an event for tracking token transfers.

There is no vulnerability in the given code.",denial of service,1.0,551.0,6.0,3.624339818954468
