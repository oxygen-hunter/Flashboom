Additionally, the constructor function in the CustomToken contract emits a Transfer event with the address of the zero address (address(0)) as the 'from' address. This can potentially cause issues when interacting with other contracts or tools that rely on the 'from' address being a valid Ethereum address.

It's essential to ensure that the contract's constructor functions properly initialize the state variables and follow the intended design. In this case, the CustomToken constructor should not bypass the sendCoin function's balance check and should not emit a Transfer event with the address of the zero address as the 'from' address.",short addresses,2.0,660.0,6.0,3.045284986495972
133,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the ""DosGas"" contract's ""emptyCreditors"" function. By setting the ""creditorAddresses"" array to an empty array and setting the ""win"" variable to true, the contract effectively denies service to all previous creditor addresses. This can be exploited to prevent legitimate users from interacting with the contract.",denial of service,3.0,509.0,6.0,4.422266483306885
134,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to denial of service attacks based on the provided code snippet. The vulnerability in the previous code was due to the lack of checks on the array's length before appending new elements, allowing an attacker to consume all available memory and cause a denial of service. However, in the given code, the contract ""CustomToken"" is derived from the ""BaseToken"" contract, and the ""insertNnumbers"" function is not present in the given code. Therefore, there is no vulnerability to denial of service attacks in the given code.",denial of service,1.0,549.0,6.0,2.7363924980163574
135,denial of service," YES, The vulnerability lies in lines 46 and 48 where the contract resets the 'creditorAddresses' and 'creditorAmounts' arrays to empty after each transaction. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the 'lendGovernmentMoney' function and drain the contract of funds by repeatedly creating new entries in the arrays without actually lending any money. This is a classic denial of service attack.",denial of service,3.0,513.0,6.0,4.010674715042114
136,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the Refunder contract's refundAll() function. The use of the require statement with the send function call in a loop can cause the entire contract to be held hostage if one refundAddress fails to send the funds back. This is a denial of service vulnerability. In the given code, the BaseToken and CustomToken contracts are not directly related to the Refunder contract, but the Refunder contract is vulnerable as written.",denial of service,3.0,531.0,6.0,3.8363614082336426
137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the DosOneFunc contract's ifillArray function. The function allows any address to add their address to the listAddresses array up to a length of 1500. Once the length limit is reached, the array is reset to an empty array. This can be exploited to perform a Denial of Service attack by repeatedly calling the ifillArray function and filling up the array, causing the contract to consume excessive gas and potentially denying service to other users. In the given code, there is no check on the number of times the ifillArray function can be called, making it easier for an attacker to exploit.",denial of service,3.0,570.0,6.0,2.564523458480835
138,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the previous question. The vulnerability in the previous question was related to a require statement that included a call to the send function, which can be used for denial of service attacks.

The given smart contract code does not include any such vulnerabilities. It is a simple contract that creates a new token with a specified name, symbol, decimals, and total supply, and assigns the total supply to a specific address. It does not include any functionality that could be used for denial of service attacks.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",denial of service,1.0,554.0,6.0,3.4210774898529053
