21,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable.

In the given code, the contract owner is set to msg.sender during contract deployment, but this value is not checked in the sendTo function, so any account can call the sendTo function and transfer funds if they have the contract address.

The BaseToken and CustomToken contracts are not directly related to the vulnerability in the MyContract contract. However, they do have their own potential vulnerabilities, such as the lack of proper access control in the CustomToken constructor, which sets the balance of a specific address to the total supply without any checks.

The vulnerability in the previous code was related to the dynamic array resizing, which is not present in this code. Instead, this code creates a new array with a fixed length during contract initialization.",denial of service,1.0,493.0,6.0,3.771477222442627
135,denial of service," YES, The vulnerability lies in lines 46 and 48 where the contract resets the 'creditorAddresses' and 'creditorAmounts' arrays to empty arrays after each transaction. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the 'lendGovernmentMoney' function and drain the contract of funds by repeatedly creating new entries in the arrays without actually lending any money. This is a classic denial of service attack.",denial of service,3.0,514.0,6.0,2.32460880279541
136,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the Refunder contract's refundAll() function. The use of the require statement with the send function call in a loop can cause the entire contract's funds to be held if one send call fails. This can result in a denial of service attack. In the given code, the BaseToken and CustomToken contracts are not related to the vulnerability, but the Refunder contract is vulnerable as described.",denial of service,3.0,526.0,6.0,1.9097387790679927
137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the DosOneFunc contract's ifillArray function. The function allows any address to add their address to the listAddresses array up to a length of 1500. Once the length of the array reaches 1500, the array is reset to an empty array. This can be exploited to perform a denial of service attack by repeatedly calling the ifillArray function and filling up the array, causing the contract to consume excessive gas and potentially denying service to other users.",denial of service,3.0,541.0,6.0,3.448014497756958
138,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the previous question. The vulnerability in the previous question was related to a require statement that included a call to the send function, which can be used for denial of service attacks.

The given smart contract code does not include any such vulnerabilities. It is a simple contract that creates a new token with a specified name, symbol, decimals, and total supply, and assigns the total supply to a specific address. It does not include any functions that can be used for denial of service attacks.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",denial of service,1.0,554.0,6.0,4.566179990768433
