This can be exploited to prevent other users from interacting with the contract.",denial of service,3.0,525.0,6.0,4.068585395812988
134,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to denial of service attacks based on the provided code snippet. The vulnerability in the previous code was due to the lack of checking the array's length before resizing it, allowing an attacker to insert more elements than the contract intended, leading to a denial of service. In the given code, the contract checks if the number of elements is equal to the array's length before resizing it, preventing the denial of service vulnerability.",denial of service,3.0,526.0,6.0,5.109319686889648
135,denial of service," YES, The vulnerability lies in lines 46 and 48 where the contract resets the 'creditorAddresses' and 'creditorAmounts' arrays to empty arrays after each transaction. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the 'lendGovernmentMoney' function and drain the contract of funds by repeatedly creating new entries in the arrays without actually lending any money. This is a classic denial of service attack.",denial of service,3.0,514.0,6.0,3.289299726486206
136,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the Refunder contract's refundAll() function. The use of the require statement with the send() function call can cause the entire refund process to fail if any single send() call fails. This can result in a denial of service, as all funds intended for refund will be held up indefinitely.",denial of service,3.0,506.0,6.0,2.432353973388672
137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the DosOneFunc contract's ifillArray function. The function allows any address to add their address to the listAddresses array up to a length of 1500. Once the length reaches 1500, the array is reset to an empty array. This can be exploited to perform a Denial of Service attack by repeatedly calling the ifillArray function and filling up the array, effectively denying access to the contract for other addresses.",denial of service,3.0,534.0,6.0,4.382473945617676
138,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the previous question. The provided code is a separate smart contract that inherits from the BaseToken contract and creates a new token called CustomToken.

This code does not contain any denial of service vulnerabilities. It only initializes the new token with a specific name, symbol, decimals, and total supply, and assigns the total supply to a specific address. The transfer event is also emitted to record the initial transfer of tokens.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",denial of service,1.0,540.0,6.0,2.504795551300049
