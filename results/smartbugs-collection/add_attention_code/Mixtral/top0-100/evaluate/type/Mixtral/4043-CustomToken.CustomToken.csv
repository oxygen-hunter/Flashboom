As explained earlier, the block timestamp can be manipulated by miners, allowing them to execute transactions more frequently than intended. In this case, an attacker could potentially manipulate the block timestamp to trigger the transfer of funds from the Roulette contract multiple times.",time manipulation,3.0,518.0,6.0,2.8775010108947754
131,time manipulation," Yes, the EtherLotto contract is vulnerable due to the use of block.timestamp to generate random numbers. The block timestamp can be manipulated by miners, allowing them to potentially influence the outcome of the contract.",time manipulation,3.0,475.0,6.0,3.3219122886657715
132,short addresses," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to the short address attack mentioned in the previous example. The vulnerability in the previous example was related to the way arguments were being encoded and passed to the contract, which is not present in the given code. The given code appears to be initializing a custom token contract with a pre-defined total supply and assigning it to a specific address. It does not involve any user input or external data that could be manipulated to cause a short address attack.",short addresses,1.0,529.0,6.0,3.923597812652588
133,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the ""DosGas"" contract's ""emptyCreditors"" function. By setting the ""creditorAddresses"" array to an empty array and setting the ""win"" variable to true, the contract effectively denies service to all other users by clearing the list of creditor addresses and making the ""iWin"" function return true. This can be exploited to prevent other users from interacting with the contract.",denial of service,3.0,525.0,6.0,2.865799903869629
134,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to denial of service attacks based on the provided code snippet. The vulnerability in the previous code was due to the lack of checks on the array's length before appending new elements, allowing an attacker to consume all available memory and cause a denial of service. However, in the given code, the contract ""CustomToken"" is derived from the ""BaseToken"" contract, and the ""insertNnumbers"" function is not present in the given code. Therefore, there is no vulnerability to denial of service attacks in the given code.",denial of service,1.0,549.0,6.0,4.725917339324951
135,denial of service," YES, The vulnerability lies in lines 46 and 48 where the contract resets the 'creditorAddresses' and 'creditorAmounts' arrays to empty arrays after each transaction. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the 'lendGovernmentMoney' function and drain the contract of funds by repeatedly creating new entries in the arrays without actually lending any money. This is a classic reentrancy attack.",denial of service,2.0,514.0,6.0,2.6221094131469727
136,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the Refunder contract's refundAll() function. The use of the require statement with the send function call in a loop can cause the entire contract's funds to be held if one send() call fails. This can result in a denial of service attack. In the given code, the BaseToken and CustomToken contracts are not related to the vulnerability, but the Refunder contract is vulnerable as described.",denial of service,3.0,527.0,6.0,5.536936283111572
137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the DosOneFunc contract's ifillArray() function. The function allows any address to add their address to the listAddresses array up to a length of 1500. This can be exploited to cause a denial of service attack by filling up the array with malicious addresses, preventing legitimate addresses from being added. In the given code, there is no check to prevent an address from repeatedly calling the ifillArray() function, allowing them to add their address multiple times. This can be done at a low gas cost, making it an easy attack vector.

The CustomToken contract is not directly related to the vulnerability and is not vulnerable on its own. However, it can be affected if an attacker manages to exploit the vulnerability in the DosOneFunc contract.",denial of service,3.0,598.0,6.0,3.623241186141968
138,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the previous question. The vulnerability in the previous question was related to a require statement that included a call to the send function, which can be used for denial of service attacks.

The given smart contract code does not include any such vulnerabilities. It is a simple contract that creates a new token with a specified name, symbol, decimals, and total supply, and assigns all the tokens to a specific address. It does not include any functionality that could be exploited for denial of service attacks.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",denial of service,1.0,554.0,6.0,4.1861419677734375
