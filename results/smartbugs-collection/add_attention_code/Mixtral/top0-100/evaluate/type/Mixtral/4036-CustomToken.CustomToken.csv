131,time manipulation," Yes, the EtherLotto contract is vulnerable due to the use of block.timestamp to generate random numbers. The block timestamp can be manipulated by miners, allowing them to potentially influence the outcome of the contract.",time manipulation,3.0,475.0,6.0,2.587054491043091
132,short addresses," The given smart contract code is not directly vulnerable to the short address attack mentioned earlier. However, it does have other potential vulnerabilities. For instance, the constructor function in the CustomToken contract initializes the balance of a specific address (0x5ebc4B61A0E0187d9a72Da21bfb8b45F519cb530) to the total supply of tokens. This means that the creator of the contract has complete control over the token supply and can distribute it as they see fit. This is a potential security risk and can lead to centralization of the token supply. Additionally, the constructor function in the CustomToken contract emits a Transfer event with the address of the zero address as the from address. This can potentially cause confusion and may not accurately reflect the actual token transfers that have taken place. However, the short address attack is not directly related to this vulnerability.",short addresses,2.0,615.0,6.0,3.1875641345977783
133,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the ""DosGas"" contract's ""emptyCreditors"" function. By setting the ""creditorAddresses"" array to an empty array and setting the ""win"" variable to true, the contract effectively denies service to all other users by clearing the list of creditor addresses and making the ""iWin"" function return true. This can be exploited to prevent other users from interacting with the contract.",denial of service,3.0,525.0,6.0,3.563807249069214
134,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to denial of service attacks based on the provided code snippet. The vulnerability in the previous code was due to the lack of checks on the array's length before appending new elements, allowing an attacker to consume all available memory and cause a denial of service. However, in the given code, the contract ""CustomToken"" is derived from the ""BaseToken"" contract, and the ""insertNnumbers"" function is not present in the given code. Therefore, there is no vulnerability to denial of service attacks in the given code.",denial of service,1.0,549.0,6.0,2.5179545879364014
135,denial of service," The given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the lines where the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays are being reset to empty arrays:

```solidity
creditorAddresses = new address[](0);
creditorAmounts = new uint[](0);
```

These lines cause the loss of all previously stored data in these arrays, effectively resetting the contract's state. This can be exploited to deny service to legitimate users by preventing them from receiving their rightfully earned rewards or loans.

In the context of the provided code, this vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to drain the contract of funds by repeatedly calling the `lendGovernmentMoney` function with large amounts and causing the contract to reset its state, thus denying service to other users and draining the contract of funds.",denial of service,3.0,595.0,6.0,3.017990827560425
136,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the Refunder contract's refundAll() function. The use of the require statement with the send() function call can cause the entire refund process to fail if any single send() call fails. This can result in a denial of service, as all funds will be held up until the failed transaction is resolved. In the given code, there is no mechanism to handle or bypass failed send() calls, making the contract vulnerable to denial of service attacks.",denial of service,3.0,536.0,6.0,3.1987838745117188
137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the DosOneFunc contract's ifillArray function. The function allows any address to add their address to the listAddresses array up to a length of 1500. This can be exploited to cause a denial of service attack by filling up the array with malicious addresses, preventing legitimate addresses from being added. In the given code, there is no check to prevent an address from repeatedly calling the ifillArray function, allowing them to add their address multiple times. This can be done in a single transaction, consuming a significant amount of gas and potentially denying service to other users.

In the case of the CustomToken contract, it is not vulnerable on its own, but it is using the DosOneFunc contract, which is vulnerable. Therefore, the entire system is vulnerable to denial of service attacks.",denial of service,3.0,606.0,6.0,3.3128483295440674
138,denial of service, The given smart contract code is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the previous question. The provided code is a separate smart contract that inherits from the BaseToken contract and has a CustomToken constructor. This contract does not appear to be vulnerable to denial of service attacks based on the given code.,denial of service,1.0,494.0,6.0,2.661606311798096
