82,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the buy function of the TokenSaleChallenge contract. The require statement in line 23 checks if msg.value (the amount of ether sent by the caller) is equal to numTokens \* PRICE\_PER\_TOKEN. However, this check does not take into account the possibility of an integer overflow, which can occur when numTokens is large enough. If an integer overflow occurs, the check will pass even if the sent amount is significantly different from the expected amount. This can lead to the contract accepting less ether than intended, or even accepting ether when no tokens should be sold.

Additionally, the sell function also has a similar vulnerability in the require statement on line 33.

The code consists of two contracts: `BaseToken` and `CustomToken`. The `BaseToken` contract is a simple ERC20 token contract, and the `CustomToken` contract is derived from `BaseToken` and sets some initial values.

Based on the given code, the `CustomToken` contract is not vulnerable to arithmetic overflows or underflows.

This can be exploited to prevent other users from interacting with the contract.",denial of service,3.0,525.0,6.0,2.19809627532959
134,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to denial of service attacks based on the provided code snippet. The vulnerability in the previous code was due to the lack of checks on the array's length before appending new elements, allowing an attacker to consume all available memory and cause a denial of service. However, in the given code, the contract ""CustomToken"" is derived from the ""BaseToken"" contract, and the ""insertNnumbers"" function is not present in the given code. Therefore, there is no vulnerability to denial of service attacks in the given code.",denial of service,1.0,549.0,6.0,3.1802165508270264
135,denial of service," YES, The vulnerability lies in lines 46 and 48 where the contract resets the 'creditorAddresses' and 'creditorAmounts' arrays to empty after each transaction. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the 'lendGovernmentMoney' function and drain the contract of funds by repeatedly creating new entries in these arrays without actually lending any money. This is a denial of service attack as it allows the attacker to prevent the contract from functioning properly.",denial of service,3.0,524.0,6.0,4.208029747009277
136,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the Refunder contract's refundAll() function. The use of the require statement with the send function call in a loop can cause the entire contract's funds to be held if one send call fails. This can result in a denial of service attack. In the given code, the BaseToken and CustomToken contracts are not related to the vulnerability, but the Refunder contract is vulnerable as described.",denial of service,3.0,526.0,6.0,3.496787548065185
137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the DosOneFunc contract's ifillArray function. The function allows any address to add their address to the listAddresses array up to a length of 1500. Once the array reaches this length, the array is reset to an empty array. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the ifillArray function and add their address to the array, consuming gas and potentially denying service to other users. In the given code, there is no check on the number of times the ifillArray function can be called, making it an easy target for a denial of service attack.",denial of service,3.0,562.0,6.0,4.06199836730957
138,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the previous question. The vulnerability in the previous question was related to a require statement that included a call to the send function, which can be used for denial of service attacks.

The given smart contract code does not include any such vulnerabilities. It is a simple contract that creates a new token with a specified name, symbol, and decimal value, and initializes the total supply and assigns it to a specific address. It does not include any functions that can be used for denial of service attacks.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",denial of service,1.0,555.0,6.0,3.0569937229156494
