73,front running," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks similar to the previous example due to the use of the `transfer` function in the `setReward` and `claimReward` functions.

The vulnerability in the original code was related to the contract's `play` function accepting ether payments, which could potentially allow a malicious user to preempt another user's transaction by paying a higher gas fee. However, in the provided code, the `play` function is declared as `payable`, which is the same as the original code.

135,denial of service," YES, The vulnerability lies in lines 46 and 48 where the contract resets the 'creditorAddresses' and 'creditorAmounts' arrays to empty arrays after each transaction. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the 'lendGovernmentMoney' function and drain the contract of funds by repeatedly creating new entries in the arrays without actually lending any money. This is a classic denial of service attack.",denial of service,3.0,514.0,6.0,3.1081159114837646
136,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue is similar to the previous one, but in this case, the vulnerability is in the'refundAll()' function. The 'for' loop should have a semicolon at the end to properly initialize the loop counter 'x'. Without it, the loop will not run, and the'require' statement inside the loop will never be executed. This means that if any single refund transaction fails, the entire'refundAll()' function will fail, and no refunds will be processed. This can be exploited to deny service to the contract by causing a single refund transaction to fail.",denial of service,3.0,561.0,6.0,2.1664414405822754
137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray()` function, specifically the for loop where new addresses are being added to the `listAddresses` array. An attacker can repeatedly call this function, causing the contract to add new addresses to the array until it reaches its gas limit, effectively denying service to other users who want to interact with the contract.",denial of service,3.0,518.0,6.0,2.542434930801392
138,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the following lines of code:

require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));

This line of code sends ether to the currentFrontrunner address along with the current bid amount. However, there is no check on whether the currentFrontrunner has sufficient ether to receive the bid amount. This can be exploited by an attacker who has previously interacted with the contract and has set the currentFrontrunner address to their own. The attacker can then repeatedly call the bid function with increasingly large bid amounts, draining the contract's ether balance and denying service to other bidders.",denial of service,3.0,563.0,6.0,3.794542789459229
