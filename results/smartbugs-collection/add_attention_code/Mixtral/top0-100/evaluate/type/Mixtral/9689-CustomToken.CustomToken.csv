However, in the given code, the contract ""CustomToken"" does not have a similar vulnerability as it does not use dynamic array resizing like the ""DosNumber"" contract.",denial of service,1.0,529.0,6.0,3.396474599838257
135,denial of service," YES, The vulnerability lies in lines 46 and 48 where the contract resets the 'creditorAddresses' and 'creditorAmounts' arrays to empty after each transaction. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the 'lendGovernmentMoney' function and drain the contract of funds by repeatedly creating new entries in these arrays without actually lending any money. This is a denial of service attack as it allows the attacker to prevent the contract from functioning properly.",denial of service,3.0,524.0,6.0,3.865968704223633
136,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the Refunder contract's refundAll() function. The use of the require statement with the send function call in a loop can cause the entire contract's funds to be held if one send call fails. This can result in a denial of service attack. In the given code, the BaseToken and CustomToken contracts are not related to the vulnerability, but the Refunder contract is vulnerable as described.",denial of service,3.0,526.0,6.0,4.3476951122283936
137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the DosOneFunc contract's ifillArray function. The function allows any address to add their address to the listAddresses array up to a length of 1500. Once the length limit is reached, the array is reset to an empty array. This can be exploited to perform a Denial of Service attack by repeatedly calling the ifillArray function and filling up the array, effectively denying access to the contract for other addresses.",denial of service,3.0,533.0,6.0,2.4856560230255127
138,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the previous question. The vulnerability in the previous question was related to a require statement that included a call to the send function, which can be used for denial of service attacks.

The given smart contract code does not include any such vulnerabilities. It is a simple contract that creates a new token with a specified name, symbol, decimals, and total supply, and assigns the total supply to a specific address. It does not include any functions that can be used for denial of service attacks.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",denial of service,1.0,554.0,6.0,2.610741376876831
