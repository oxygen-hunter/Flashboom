12,access control," Yes, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the fact that the `missing` function in the `Missing` contract sets the `owner` address to the `msg.sender` without any checks or restrictions.

In the given code, this vulnerability is exploited in the `CustomToken` contract where the `totalSupply` is assigned to an arbitrary address during contract creation.",access control,3.0,533.0,6.0,3.0966274738311768

23,access control," Yes, the SimpleSuicide contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is that the function `sudicideAnyone()` allows any address to call it and destroy the contract, including the contract's creator's address.

76,front running," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks. The vulnerability lies in the ""play"" function, which is payable and does not check the gas price or gas limit of the incoming transaction. This means that a malicious user can submit a transaction with a higher gas price to preempt the current transaction and execute the ""andTheWinnerIs"" function before the original transaction, potentially stealing the winnings.

Additionally, the ""CustomToken"" contract is not directly related to the vulnerability in the ""OddsAndEvens"" contract, but it does have its own vulnerabilities. The constructor sets the initial balance of a specific address to the total supply of the token, and then emits a Transfer event with the from address set to the address of the zero Ethereum address (0x0). This means that the event will not be emitted to any contract or address in particular, and it may not be possible to trace the origin of the token supply. This could potentially be used to obscure the origin of the token supply or to facilitate other nefarious activities.",front running,4.0,644.0,6.0,3.041102647781372

In the given code, there is no arithmetic operation that could lead to an overflow or underflow. The ""init"" function in the ""IntegerOverflowMappingSym1"" contract is not present in the given code.

80,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is not directly related to the IntegerOverflowMinimal contract, but rather to the CustomToken contract.

82,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `buy` function in the `TokenSaleChallenge` contract. The `require` statement in line 23 checks if the `msg.value` (the amount of ether sent with the transaction) is equal to `numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN`. However, this check does not take into account the possibility of an integer overflow. If a user sends more ether than the maximum representable value of a `uint256`, the check will pass even though the transaction contains more ether than intended. This can be exploited to buy more tokens than intended, draining the contract of funds.

Additionally, the `sell` function also has a similar vulnerability in line 33, where it checks if `balanceOf[msg.sender] >= numTokens` without checking for integer overflows. This can allow a user to sell more tokens than they actually have, draining the contract of tokens and ether.

This can result in the `count` variable becoming negative, which is not intended and can lead to unintended behavior or vulnerabilities.

In the `CustomToken` contract, the vulnerability is not directly present, but the `run` function of the `IntegerOverflowMultiTxOneFuncFeasible` contract is being called multiple times in the constructor, potentially allowing for an arithmetic overflow to occur.

The vulnerability in the previous code was due to the contract not checking the array length before appending new elements, allowing an attacker to consume all available memory and cause a denial of service. However, in the given code, the contract checks if the array length is equal to the number of elements before appending new ones, preventing such an attack.",denial of service,1.0,524.0,6.0,2.943480968475342
135,denial of service, The given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in lines 46 and 48 of the Government contract where the arrays are being reset to empty arrays after each transaction. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the lendGovernmentMoney function and drain the contract of funds. This is a classic denial of service attack.,denial of service,3.0,498.0,6.0,3.355551481246948
136,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue lies in the Refunder contract's refundAll() function. The use of the require statement with the send() function call can cause the entire refund process to fail if one send() call fails. This can result in a denial of service, as all funds intended for refunds will be held up.",denial of service,3.0,504.0,6.0,3.371267080307007
137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the DosOneFunc contract's ifillArray function. The function allows any address to add their address to the listAddresses array up to a length of 1500. This can be exploited to cause a denial of service attack by filling up the array with malicious addresses, preventing legitimate addresses from being added. In the given code, there is no check to ensure that only the contract owner can call the ifillArray function, making it open to anyone.",denial of service,3.0,538.0,6.0,2.8371970653533936
138,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the previous question. The vulnerability in the previous question was related to a denial of service attack, which is not present in the given code.

The given code is a contract named ""CustomToken"" that inherits from a contract named ""BaseToken"". The ""CustomToken"" contract initializes the ""BaseToken"" contract with a total supply of 100 billion tokens and assigns all of them to a single address.

This code is not vulnerable to any denial of service attacks as described in the previous question. It is simply a contract that initializes a token with a large supply and assigns it to a single address.",denial of service,1.0,569.0,6.0,2.918975591659546
