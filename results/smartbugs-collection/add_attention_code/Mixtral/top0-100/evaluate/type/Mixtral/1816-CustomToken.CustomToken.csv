131,time manipulation," Yes, the EtherLotto contract is vulnerable due to the use of block.timestamp to generate random numbers. The block timestamp can be manipulated by miners, allowing them to potentially influence the outcome of the contract.",time manipulation,3.0,475.0,6.0,2.394890069961548
132,short addresses," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to the short address attack mentioned in the previous example. The vulnerability in the previous example was related to the way arguments were being encoded and passed to the contract, which is not present in this code. However, it is always important to follow best practices when writing smart contracts, such as using the latest Solidity version, properly handling exceptions, and minimizing the use of reentrancy-prone functions like send() and transfer().",short addresses,1.0,527.0,6.0,3.546170711517334
133,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the ""DosGas"" contract's ""emptyCreditors"" function. By setting the ""creditorAddresses"" array to an empty array and setting the ""win"" variable to true, the contract effectively denies service to all previous creditor addresses. This can be exploited to prevent legitimate users from interacting with the contract.",denial of service,3.0,509.0,6.0,3.232106208801269
134,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to denial of service attacks based on the provided code snippet. The vulnerability in the previous code was due to the lack of checks on the array's length before appending new elements, allowing an attacker to consume all available memory and cause a denial of service. However, in the given code, the contract ""CustomToken"" is derived from the ""BaseToken"" contract, and the ""insertNnumbers"" function is not present in the given code. Therefore, there is no vulnerability to denial of service attacks in the given code.",denial of service,1.0,549.0,6.0,3.460319995880127
135,denial of service," YES, The vulnerability lies in lines 46 and 48 where the contract resets the 'creditorAddresses' and 'creditorAmounts' arrays to empty after each transaction. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the 'lendGovernmentMoney' function and drain the contract of funds by repeatedly creating new entries in the arrays without actually lending any money. This is a classic denial of service attack.",denial of service,3.0,513.0,6.0,2.0682106018066406
136,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the Refunder contract's refundAll() function. The use of the require statement with the send function call in a loop can cause the entire contract to be held hostage if one send() call fails. This can result in a denial of service attack. In the given code, the Refunder contract is not checking for the success of the send() function call before moving on to the next address in the loop, making it vulnerable to this type of attack.",denial of service,3.0,538.0,6.0,2.031824350357056
137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the DosOneFunc contract's ifillArray function. The function allows any address to add their address to the listAddresses array up to a length of 1500. This can be exploited to cause a denial of service attack by filling up the array with malicious addresses, preventing legitimate addresses from being added. In the given code, there is no check to prevent an address from repeatedly calling the ifillArray function, allowing them to add their address multiple times. This can be done at a low gas cost, making it an easy attack vector.

The CustomToken contract is not vulnerable in this code snippet as it does not interact with the DosOneFunc contract. However, it is always important to ensure that smart contracts are secure and free of vulnerabilities before deploying them to the mainnet.",denial of service,3.0,604.0,6.0,4.061918020248413
138,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the previous question. The vulnerability in the previous question was related to a require statement that included a call to the send function, which can be used for denial of service attacks.

The given smart contract code does not include any such vulnerabilities. It is a simple contract that creates a new token with a specified name, symbol, decimals, and total supply, and assigns the total supply to a specific address. It does not include any functions that can be used for denial of service attacks.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",denial of service,1.0,554.0,6.0,2.6027629375457764
