14,access control,"YES. The vulnerability in the provided code is due to the incorrect access control in the `withdraw` function within the `Wallet` contract. Specifically, the condition `require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);` is flawed because it should be `require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);`. The current implementation allows a withdrawal even if the requested `amount` is greater than the sender's balance, which would allow an attacker to withdraw more than they have, effectively draining the contract.",1201,94,7.134065389633179
15,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `IamMissing` function, which is a public function that allows any user to set themselves as the owner of the contract.

16,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is related to **access control** in the `Map` contract. Specifically:

- In the `set` function, **anyone** can modify the map by providing a key and value. There is no access control in place to restrict who can modify the contract's data, allowing arbitrary external accounts to update the values stored in the map.
  
",1159,79,5.69101881980896
17,access control,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable because it uses `delegatecall` in the `forward` function without proper access control.

18,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in the `Wallet` contract lies in the access control. Specifically:

1. **Public Access to Sensitive Functions**: Functions such as `PushBonusCode`, `PopBonusCode`, and `UpdateBonusCodeAt` are publicly accessible. These should likely be restricted to the contract owner or other authorized users, but no access control is enforced. As a result, any external user can modify the contract's internal state, leading to potential misuse or manipulation of the `bonusCodes` array.

2. **Inadequate Condition Check in PopBonusCode**: The condition `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length);` is redundant because `bonusCodes.length` is always non-negative (since it is an unsigned integer). This means the check offers no protection, allowing any user to decrement the length of the array unchecked, potentially causing data loss or out-of-bounds access errors.

The `CustomToken` contract does not present any critical vulnerabilities directly related to access control but may still be at risk if paired with insecure logic elsewhere.",1255,216,12.570772647857666
19,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `Constructor` function in both `Missing` and `CustomToken` contracts. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, constructor functions are defined using the contract name, but in the provided code, the `Constructor` function is incorrectly named with an uppercase ""C."" This causes the function to be treated as a regular public function instead of a constructor, allowing anyone to call it and potentially reassign the `owner` variable. This is a critical access control vulnerability.",1084,104,7.574770927429199
20,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `initWallet` function. Since it is a public function, anyone can call it and set the `creator` to their own address. This compromises the security of the contract because the `migrateTo` function relies on `creator` to be correctly set for authorization. An attacker could call `initWallet` to become the `creator` and then use `migrateTo` to transfer the contract's balance to an address they control.",1219,96,9.344093799591064
21,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the same line as before: `require(tx.origin == owner);` in the `sendTo` function.

Since miners can manipulate the block timestamp, they could potentially exploit this vulnerability by adjusting the timestamp to ensure specific outcomes, such as winning the balance of the contract if `now % 15 == 0`. Therefore, this contract is vulnerable to timestamp manipulation attacks.",1133,93,8.320594549179077
131,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in line 43: 

```solidity
var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;
```

This line generates randomness using `block.timestamp`, which can be manipulated by miners, making the contract vulnerable to time manipulation attacks. Since miners have some control over the block's timestamp, they could potentially alter the outcome of the random number generation, leading to an unfair advantage. This makes the contract's reliance on `block.timestamp` for randomness insecure.",1243,106,8.939729690551758

133,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability occurs in the `DosGas` contract due to the following reasons:

- The `emptyCreditors` function checks if the `creditorAddresses.length` exceeds 1500. If it does, it attempts to reset the array to an empty array (`creditorAddresses = new address `). However, the gas cost for manipulating such a large array can be extremely high. This could lead to a **Denial of Service (DoS)** because users may not have enough gas to execute the function, effectively preventing the contract from functioning as intended. This vulnerability falls under the category of **gas exhaustion**, which can be exploited by attackers.

",1259,138,8.567477464675903
134,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability exists in the `insertNnumbers` function. Specifically, lines 18-22 can lead to a denial of service due to excessive gas consumption. As the array grows dynamically, every time the contract tries to expand it (`array.length += 1`), the gas cost increases significantly. If `numbers` is large, this loop can consume more gas than allowed in a single transaction, causing the transaction to fail and making the contract unusable. This leads to a potential denial of service.",1359,103,8.730232000350952
135,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `lendGovernmentMoney` function. Specifically, when resetting `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` to empty arrays (lines 46 and 48), if a contract receives more creditors than the gas limit allows for iteration or for future creditors to be paid out, this can lead to a denial of service attack. This is because looping over long arrays can become too expensive in terms of gas, effectively locking the contract and preventing further operations.",2333,97,8.827036142349243
136,denial of service,"YES. 

The vulnerability is in the `refundAll` function of the `Refunder` contract, just like in the previous example. The use of `require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));` means that if any of the refunds fail (for instance, if the recipient rejects the transaction or runs out of gas), the entire loop and function will fail, preventing other users from receiving their refunds. This creates a denial of service vulnerability, where one failing address can block all other users from being refunded.",1242,109,6.528727293014526
137,denial of service,"YES. The contract is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the `ifillArray` function in the `DosOneFunc` contract. The loop in the function that pushes addresses to the `listAddresses` array (specifically, the loop running 350 iterations per call) could potentially lead to a situation where the gas required to execute the function exceeds the block gas limit. This would prevent the function from being called successfully and could result in a denial of service for the contract.",1136,99,5.901209592819214
138,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the same line as the original code: `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));`. This is susceptible to a **denial of service** attack because if the `send` function fails (for example, if the recipient is a contract that has a fallback function that consumes more gas than allowed), the transaction will revert. This prevents any other bidders from participating in the auction, causing a denial of service.",1129,90,7.871873617172241
