The vulnerability lies in the **`newOwner`** function within the `MultiOwnable` contract. This function allows any external address to assign themselves or others as an owner without proper access control. Specifically, it does not restrict who can call the function, meaning any user can become an owner by calling it. This bypasses the intended control over ownership and introduces an **access control** vulnerability.",1311,83,7.712342739105225

The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw()` function of the `Map` contract. The `withdraw()` function uses a simple check with `require(msg.sender == owner)` to restrict access, but there is no additional access control mechanism to protect the `owner` address itself, which could potentially be changed or compromised. If the `owner` address is exposed or a vulnerability allows unauthorized access to it, the entire contract's balance could be withdrawn by an attacker. Additionally, there is no `constructor` function that assigns an initial `owner`, which means the `owner` remains unset and thus anyone could potentially become the `owner`.

The contract is vulnerable due to the use of low-level `call()` in the `fundPuppets()` and `Puppet` contract. These calls are unchecked, meaning the return value of these calls is not evaluated to determine whether they succeeded or failed. This can lead to potential vulnerabilities such as:

73,front running,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

It is vulnerable to a front-running attack, similar to the original code. Specifically:

1. In `claimReward(uint256 submission)`, an attacker can observe the original transaction where a valid submission is being made and submit their own transaction with a higher gas fee, preempting the original transaction and claiming the reward first.
   
2. Additionally, the use of `transfer` for sending Ether can be problematic in certain cases, as it could expose the contract to other attacks like reentrancy, though this is not directly related to the ""front-running"" vulnerability.

",1164,122,10.671194553375244
74,front running,"YES, it is vulnerable because the `solve` function in the `FindThisHash` contract still allows a front-running attack. The vulnerability arises from the `require(hash == sha3(solution))` statement.

77,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the same issue: integer underflow.

In the function `init(uint256 k, uint256 v)` in the `IntegerOverflowMappingSym1` contract, the operation `map[k] -= v;` can result in an underflow if `v` is greater than `map[k]`, as there is no check ensuring that `map[k]` is greater than or equal to `v`.",953,90,8.08318543434143
78,arithmetic,"YES. The contract is vulnerable because the same arithmetic overflow issue persists in the `IntegerOverflowMul` contract. Specifically, in the `run()` function, the line `count *= input;` is susceptible to an overflow if the input is large enough, which can lead to unexpected behavior. This type of vulnerability can result in the manipulation of the contract state, potentially allowing malicious actors to exploit the contract.",933,81,7.155946969985962
79,arithmetic,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `Overflow_Add` contract, which is vulnerable to integer overflow in the `add` function. The version of Solidity used (0.4.25) does not automatically check for arithmetic overflows. If a sufficiently large value is passed as `deposit`, the `balance` can overflow, leading to incorrect results and potential exploitation.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` constructor uses a transfer event but does not explicitly define or invoke the `transfer` function for tokens. However, this is unrelated to the arithmetic vulnerability.

Thus, the main vulnerability is due to the arithmetic overflow risk in the `Overflow_Add` contract.",929,130,17.56301498413086
80,arithmetic,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the same line:

```solidity
count -= input;

This line can lead to an integer underflow if the value of `input` is greater than `count`. Since `count` is initially set to 1, a large enough input value can cause `count` to wrap around, leading to unintended behavior.",933,72,7.3191587924957275
81,arithmetic,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the same issue of integer overflow in the `increaseLockTime` function of the `TimeLock` contract. If a very large value is passed to `_secondsToIncrease`, it can cause an overflow in `lockTime[msg.sender]`, which resets the lock time to a much smaller value or even allows immediate withdrawal. This is a case of an arithmetic vulnerability, specifically an overflow issue.

The contract is vulnerable due to potential integer overflow/underflow in arithmetic operations. Specifically, in the `buy` function (line 23) and the `sell` function (line 33), the multiplication of `numTokens` by `PRICE_PER_TOKEN` can cause overflows in earlier versions of Solidity (like 0.4.21), as the Solidity compiler did not have built-in overflow checks at that time.

In the `buy` function, if `numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN` overflows, it may pass the `require` check with incorrect values, allowing the purchase of tokens at a lower price. Similarly, in the `sell` function, overflows in `msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN)` can result in incorrect amounts of Ether being transferred, potentially causing a loss or theft of funds.",1231,171,12.860440015792847

The vulnerability arises from the fact that in the `IntegerOverflowMultiTxOneFuncFeasible` contract, the line `count -= input;` allows for the possibility of an integer underflow. Since `count` is an unsigned integer, subtracting a value larger than the current `count` could cause an underflow, wrapping the value of `count` to a large number. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the contract's state by exploiting this underflow.

To prevent this vulnerability, arithmetic operations involving unsigned integers should include proper checks for underflows and overflows, such as using the SafeMath library, which was introduced later in Solidity versions to protect against these types of vulnerabilities.",1003,141,7.179545879364014

The vulnerability lies in the same area as the previously explained code: the randomness generation process. Specifically, the contract uses weak sources of randomness like `block.coinbase`, `msg.sender`, and `block.difficulty`, which are all predictable or can be manipulated by malicious actors such as miners or participants.

```

uses the block number to decide the outcome of the bet, which can be influenced by miners. Since miners can control block numbers, they can manipulate the outcome, making the contract vulnerable to exploitation.

This line allows the sender (which can be a malicious contract) to call back into the `withdraw` function before the contract's state is updated. If a malicious contract is used as `msg.sender`, it can recursively call `withdraw` multiple times, draining the contract’s funds by exploiting the fact that the contract’s state (`credit[msg.sender]`) isn't updated until after the transfer of funds is made.
