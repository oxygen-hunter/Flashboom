11,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the **`newOwner`** function within the `MultiOwnable` contract. Specifically, any current owner can add a new owner by setting the `owners[_owner] = msg.sender`, without any validation or restriction on who can be added as an owner. This could allow any owner to arbitrarily assign ownership rights to others, which can lead to a privilege escalation and loss of control over the contract.",1319,94,6.439943075180054
12,access control,"YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

**Why it is vulnerable:**
1. **Access Control Issue in `ENXAirDrop` Contract:**
   - The `ENXAirDrop` contract inherits from the `Ownable` contract, which establishes an `onlyOwner` modifier. However, the `owner` variable in `Ownable` is never initialized, meaning that any address could be considered the owner.
   - This allows anyone to call the `airDrop` function and initiate transfers from the specified `contractObj`, leading to unauthorized transfers.

2. **Uninitialized State Variables:**
   - The `owner` variable in `Ownable` is public and uninitialized. This creates a situation where the first person to interact with the contract can set themselves as the owner, gaining control over restricted functions such as `airDrop`.

These vulnerabilities expose the contract to potential loss of funds and unauthorized access to restricted functionality.",1057,190,10.92457389831543
13,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the **`DynamicPyramid()` constructor** function, which allows anyone to call it. In Solidity versions prior to 0.4.22, constructors were not explicitly marked with the `constructor` keyword, meaning they could be mistakenly treated as regular functions. This allows anyone to reinitialize the `creator` variable to their own address, effectively gaining ownership of the contract and bypassing access control. This is a serious **access control vulnerability**.",2977,102,6.814476013183594
14,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `airDrop` function of the `ENXAirDrop` contract. The function allows the `onlyOwner` modifier to control access, but it lacks proper checks for the validity of the array lengths (`airDropDesinationAddress` and `amounts`). This could lead to potential inconsistencies during the execution of the loop, especially if these arrays are not of the same length, causing unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function blindly calls `transferFrom` without ensuring that the `ERC20Interface` contract supports sufficient token transfers, which could lead to failed or partial transfers. These access control issues make the contract vulnerable.",1174,137,8.231471061706543
15,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the constructor of the `Missing` contract. The function `IamMissing()` is meant to set the contract owner, but it is a public function rather than a constructor.

The vulnerability lies in the `airDrop` function of the `ENXAirDrop` contract, which does not include any validation for the length of the `airDropDesinationAddress` and `amounts` arrays. This could lead to mismatched lengths between these arrays, potentially causing issues during the transfer of tokens. Additionally, there is no validation on the `contractObj` and `tokenRepo` addresses, which could be exploited if these addresses are malicious or invalid. These factors open up access control vulnerabilities, especially since the `onlyOwner` modifier alone does not ensure secure handling of the token transfers.",1228,125,9.717321157455444
19,access control,"YES, the vulnerability exists due to improper implementation of the constructor in the `Missing` contract. The function named `Constructor` is incorrectly written as a regular function rather than the actual constructor, which should have the same name as the contract (`Missing`) in Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0. This allows anyone to call this function and reset the `owner` variable to their own address, thus bypassing the intended access control.

This type of access control issue arises because the real constructor isn't defined, leaving the contract's ownership mechanism compromised. An attacker could take ownership and perform unauthorized actions like calling the `withdraw` function.",1057,128,12.00529932975769
20,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper access control for the `initWallet` function in the `Wallet` contract.

68,unchecked low level calls,"YES. The contract is vulnerable because the `msg.sender.call.value(balances[msg.sender])()` in the `withdraw()` function does not check the return value of the low-level call. If the call fails, the funds will remain in the `balances[msg.sender]` mapping, but the balance is set to 0 regardless, leading to a loss of funds. This is an unchecked low-level call vulnerability.",1076,83,7.409926176071167
69,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The vulnerability in the `MultiplicatorX4` contract lies in the use of the low-level `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);` function within the `Command` function. This low-level call does not check the return value, which means if the call fails, the contract will not revert the transaction and could lead to unintended behavior or a fail-open vulnerability.",1199,77,5.820578336715698
70,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is similar to the first contract, where low-level function calls are used without checking the return values. Specifically, in the `ENXAirDrop` contract, the `transferFrom` function from the `ERC20Interface` is called within the loop, but the return value of this function is not checked. If the `transferFrom` call fails, the transaction will not revert, leading to potential issues such as loss of funds or incomplete airdrops. The failure of `transferFrom` should be handled properly by checking the return value.",1129,118,17.519858360290527

72,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the use of low-level call functions without proper error handling. Specifically:

1. **Unchecked Low-Level Call**: In the `Proxy` contract, the function `proxy` calls `target.call.value(msg.value)(data)` without verifying whether the call succeeded. This could lead to a situation where, if the `call` fails, the transaction continues executing, which could result in unexpected behaviors and vulnerabilities.

2. **Reentrancy Risk in Withdraw**: In the `DepositProxy` contract, the `withdraw` function allows the `msg.sender` (who must be the `Owner`) to call `transfer`, which is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. This function could be manipulated if a malicious contract reenters during the withdrawal process. 

Both of these vulnerabilities are significant issues that could lead to the loss of funds if exploited.",1347,175,5.1426708698272705

74,front running,"YES. The vulnerability in the first part of the contract (`FindThisHash`) still exists in the new code. The `solve` function compares the user-provided solution against a publicly known hash using `require(hash == sha3(solution))`. Since the solution must be sent as a transaction and is visible in the pending transaction pool, a front-running attack is possible. Malicious actors can copy the solution and front-run the original transaction by offering higher gas fees to preempt the correct solver, allowing them to claim the reward.

",1118,106,9.640835523605347
75,front running,"YES

The vulnerability in this contract lies in the potential for front-running during the execution of the `airDrop` function. Since the function sends tokens to multiple addresses in a loop, a malicious actor could observe the transaction and front-run it by submitting a similar transaction with higher gas fees. This would allow the attacker to interfere with the token distribution, potentially depleting the token repository or modifying the intended recipients. Additionally, the lack of validation on the `transferFrom` function return value within the loop exacerbates this risk.",2192,106,10.524689435958862
76,front running,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks. Specifically:

1. **Front-Running Vulnerability in `play()` Function**: The `play(uint number) payable` function in the `OddsAndEvens` contract is vulnerable to front-running. When a player submits their number, another party can see the pending transaction and submit their own with a higher gas fee to preempt it. This way, a malicious user could influence the game outcome by reacting to the first player's number.

2. **Race Condition in AirDrop Function**: In the `ENXAirDrop` contract, the `airDrop()` function performs token transfers within a loop. Since the loop depends on the `airDropDesinationAddress` and `amounts` arrays, this could result in front-running vulnerabilities, especially if an attacker can modify the length or state of the involved variables in some way. Also, looping through an array with dynamic length might cause gas issues and make the function vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.",1391,208,6.034576177597046

This vulnerability arises from the risk of exhausting the gas limit during execution, which can make the contract unusable for large datasets.",1109,78,6.7197511196136475
138,denial of service,"**YES**, the vulnerability lies in the `airDrop` function of the `ENXAirDrop` contract. Specifically, it uses a `for` loop to transfer tokens to multiple addresses. If the list of recipients (`airDropDesinationAddress`) is very large, the loop might run out of gas, causing a denial of service (DoS) attack. Since Ethereum has a gas limit per block, processing a large array in one transaction could lead to the contract's failure to execute properly, making it vulnerable to DoS due to gas exhaustion.",1102,112,8.24796199798584
