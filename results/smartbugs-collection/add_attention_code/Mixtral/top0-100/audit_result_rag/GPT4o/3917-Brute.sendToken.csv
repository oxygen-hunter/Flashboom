This type of low-level call does not propagate errors and returns a boolean value indicating success or failure. If the return value is not checked (which it isn't in this code), it can lead to issues such as reentrancy attacks. An attacker can repeatedly call the `withdraw()` function and drain the contract's funds because the balance is set to zero only after the low-level call is made, leading to potential reentrancy vulnerabilities.

Additionally, in the `Brute` contract, while it interacts with an ERC20 contract, the vulnerability focus remains on the unchecked call in the `keepMyEther` contract, making it exploitable.",1010,173,10.60338282585144
69,unchecked low level calls,"YES. 

The vulnerability lies in the `Command` function, which uses `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);` without checking the return value of the low-level `call` function. This could lead to a failure in the `call` execution without the contract being aware, resulting in a potential fail-open scenario. Additionally, low-level calls do not automatically revert on failure, which may lead to unintentional contract behavior.",1133,87,6.5818562507629395
70,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the vulnerability lies in the unchecked low-level call in the `EBU` contract:

71,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the use of the low-level function `_target.call.value(_value)()` in the `SimpleWallet` contract. This function does not check the return value of the `call`, which can result in a fail-open scenario if the `call` fails. The failure will not revert the transaction, allowing execution to continue even though the intended transfer of funds may not occur. As a result, funds could be lost or stuck if the `call` fails, making it vulnerable.",1111,101,9.663876295089722
72,unchecked low level calls,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the use of the low-level `target.call.value(msg.value)(data)` in the `Proxy` contract without checking the return value. This low-level call can fail silently without reverting the transaction, which can lead to potential security issues.

73,front running,"YES. The contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks due to the same reasons explained earlier, particularly in the `setReward` and `claimReward` functions. Since the Ethereum blockchain is public, attackers can observe the transaction setting or claiming the reward and front-run it by submitting a higher-fee transaction, exploiting the ordering of transactions in the blockchain to their advantage.",1106,73,6.885796785354614
74,front running,"YES. The vulnerability in the `FindThisHash` contract lies in the front-running potential of the `solve` function.

75,front running,"YES

The vulnerability in this code is related to **front-running**. Specifically, in the `Brute` contract's `sendToken` function, a malicious user could observe a legitimate transaction on the public blockchain and submit a similar transaction with a higher gas fee, causing their transaction to be processed first. This allows them to ""front-run"" the original transaction and potentially gain an advantage, such as stealing tokens.

This vulnerability is common in contracts involving approvals and transfers, as the public nature of the blockchain allows malicious actors to preempt transactions by offering higher gas fees.",2126,115,10.520889520645142
76,front running,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The contract is susceptible to a front-running attack because it allows players to submit their moves (`number`) without any encryption or mechanism to hide them. Since all transactions on the Ethereum blockchain are public, a malicious actor can observe the first player's transaction and submit their own transaction with a higher gas fee, ensuring their transaction gets mined first. This allows them to manipulate the outcome of the game, as they know the first player's move and can choose a number to guarantee a win.

The vulnerability lies in lines:

- Line 25: `function play(uint number) payable` â€” where players submit their numbers without any protection.
- Line 28: `players[tot] = Player(msg.sender, number)` â€” where the player's number is immediately recorded and visible, allowing it to be exploited by a front-runner.",1325,170,13.601467370986938

Specifically, the `balance += deposit;` operation in the `Overflow_Add` contract can result in an integer overflow if the `deposit` is large enough, which could allow an attacker to manipulate the balance variable. 

In Solidity version 0.4.25, integer overflows and underflows are not automatically checked, making this contract vulnerable without explicit checks or the use of libraries like `SafeMath` to prevent overflows.",871,108,9.743021965026855

The vulnerability lies in the `count -= input;` line, which can cause an arithmetic underflow in the `IntegerOverflowMinimal` contract if the `input` value is greater than `count`. This would result in an underflow, where `count` would wrap around to a very large number instead of a negative value.

- In the `buy` function, line 23: `require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`, an arithmetic overflow can occur if `numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN` exceeds the maximum value of `uint256`. This can allow attackers to bypass the requirement, leading to unintended behavior.
  
- In the `sell` function, line 33: `msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`, an overflow in `numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN` could lead to the contract attempting to transfer an unexpectedly high amount of ether, potentially draining the contract's balance.",1173,146,10.409093856811523
83,arithmetic,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is in the `IntegerOverflowMultiTxMultiFuncFeasible` contract, specifically in the `run` function. The subtraction operation (`count -= input`) can result in an integer underflow. Since `count` is an unsigned integer (`uint256`), if `input` is greater than `count`, it will wrap around to a very large number, causing an unexpected result.

The vulnerability lies in the same issue as the first contract: **arithmetic overflow** in the `IntegerOverflowAdd` contract. Specifically, in the `run()` function at `count += input;`, there is no check to prevent an overflow, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially cause the contract to store an incorrect value in `count`.

Additionally, there are no protections in the `Brute` contract to ensure that the token transfer is safe or guarded against vulnerabilities like overflows in the transferred value (`_value`).",875,114,7.487195014953613

The contract is vulnerable due to the same issues with randomness as described previously. Specifically, the sources of randomness used in the `chooseWinner()` function are predictable:

1. `block.coinbase` (line 99) is accessible to miners, who can influence it.
2. `msg.sender` (line 101) is entirely predictable since it refers to the transaction sender.
3. `block.difficulty` (line 103) is also predictable and can be influenced by miners.

These predictable values make the random number generation insecure, allowing potential attackers to manipulate or predict the outcome of the raffle.",2741,123,7.631368398666382

allows the `msg.sender` to execute arbitrary code, potentially re-entering the contract and calling `CashOut` repeatedly before the `balances[msg.sender]` is updated, effectively draining the contract's funds. The `balances[msg.sender] -= _am;` statement is executed only after the external call, which makes it vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.",1418,115,5.521129131317139
125,reentrancy,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the use of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `Collect` function. This can lead to a reentrancy attack, as it allows external contracts to repeatedly call the `Collect` function before the contract's state (i.e., the balance) is updated, potentially draining funds.",1572,67,7.183818578720093
126,reentrancy,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. The `withdrawBalance` function in `Reentrancy_insecure` contract is susceptible to a reentrancy attack. Since it uses `call.value` to transfer Ether before updating the balance (`userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;`), an attacker can repeatedly call `withdrawBalance` before the balance is set to zero, allowing them to drain funds.",1030,80,6.642632722854614
127,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The contract still relies on `block.timestamp` in the `isSaleFinished` function. As mentioned, `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners, which introduces the risk of time manipulation attacks. This makes the contract vulnerable.",938,52,6.410993814468384
128,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability still exists due to the reliance on `block.timestamp` (or `now`) in lines 13 and 27 for determining time-sensitive logic and generating random numbers, which can be manipulated by miners.",1173,44,5.179877042770386
129,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability arises from the reliance on `block.timestamp` for critical logic in the `invest` and `resetInvestment` functions. Miners can manipulate `block.timestamp` within a certain range, allowing them to potentially control the timing of the `resetInvestment` function. This can lead to unfair advantages in the game, as a miner could manipulate the time to trigger the reset in their favor.",1341,85,6.174062728881836
130,time manipulation,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable because it relies on the `now` (or `block.timestamp`) to determine the validity of actions, specifically in lines:

- `require(now != pastBlockTime);` (line 18) - This condition attempts to prevent multiple transactions within the same block but can be manipulated by a miner.
- `pastBlockTime = now;` (line 20) - This updates the time reference but still leaves it vulnerable since miners can influence `now` to some extent.

The miner can manipulate the block timestamp, allowing them to influence the outcome of the condition `if(now % 15 == 0)`, potentially allowing them to drain the contract's balance.",1040,141,7.078899383544922
131,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because it relies on `block.timestamp` to generate the random number in the `play()` function. Since miners can manipulate the block timestamp within a certain range, they can influence the outcome of the `random` calculation, which is used to decide if the player wins or loses. This makes the contract susceptible to time manipulation attacks.",1150,73,6.014591455459595
132,short addresses,"YES. The contract is vulnerable to a short address attack in the `sendCoin` function due to the EVM accepting incorrectly padded arguments. This could allow an attacker to exploit the vulnerability by using specially-crafted addresses, leading to incorrectly encoded arguments before being included in transactions.",1198,54,5.448686361312866
133,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability exists in the `emptyCreditors()` function. If the `creditorAddresses` array grows too large (greater than 1500 addresses), attempting to reset it with `creditorAddresses = new address ;` can require excessive gas, potentially causing a denial of service (DoS). This is because the cost to modify or clear large arrays increases with the array's size, making it likely that the function will run out of gas and fail to execute when the array becomes large enough. This could prevent the contract from functioning properly.",1166,111,5.907494068145752
134,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability exists in the `insertNnumbers` function. The dynamic resizing of the `array` in each iteration (lines 19-20) can lead to high gas consumption, especially when a large number of elements are being inserted, potentially causing a denial of service (DoS) by exceeding the gas limit.",1266,66,5.356452941894531
135,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the potential **denial of service** caused by line 46 (`creditorAddresses = new address ;`) and line 48 (`creditorAmounts = new uint ;`). Resetting these arrays can prevent the contract from functioning correctly, especially if the arrays are cleared before all creditors are paid out, causing a denial of service to remaining creditors who cannot claim their payouts.",2240,80,6.926229238510132
136,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in line 24: `require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));`. If one of the addresses rejects the transfer or fails for any reason, it will cause the entire loop to revert, leading to a denial of service (DoS). This means that a single failure will prevent all refunds from being processed, which makes the contract vulnerable to a DoS attack.",1149,85,7.934384346008301
137,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `DosOneFunc` contract, specifically in the `ifillArray` function. This function includes a loop that adds elements to the `listAddresses` array, which could potentially consume excessive gas. Since the loop runs 350 times in each execution, if the array gets close to the length limit of 1500, the gas required to complete the operation could exceed the block gas limit, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). This would make the function impossible to execute due to the high gas cost, effectively locking the contract and preventing further interactions.

",1043,125,7.947303295135498
138,denial of service,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack because of the `currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid)` line. This is due to the use of `.send()`, which could fail if the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that has a fallback function using too much gas or intentionally causing the transaction to fail, preventing others from bidding and thus denying service.",1036,84,8.17466115951538
