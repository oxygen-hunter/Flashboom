The vulnerability lies in the reckless use of `delegatecall` on lines 31 and 38 in the `FibonacciBalance` contract. Since `delegatecall` executes code in the context of the calling contract (in this case, `FibonacciBalance`), an attacker can exploit this by sending crafted data through the fallback function or altering the behavior of the `fibonacciLibrary`, potentially causing unauthorized fund transfers or state changes.

Additionally, in the `FibonacciLib` contract, the `get()` function transfers funds to hardcoded addresses, which introduces further security risks, as an attacker can hijack these transfers without proper access control.",1392,130,13.881407022476196

  - `address(0x83c0Efc6d8B16D87BFe1335AB6BcAb3Ed3960285).transfer(address(this).balance);`

The `.transfer()` function does not check for potential errors that might occur during the Ether transfer (e.g., running out of gas). If the transfer fails, it does not revert the transaction, and the contract continues execution.

This is a critical issue because it might allow malicious contracts to exploit this behavior.",1369,112,12.833681344985962
68,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The contract is vulnerable due to the use of low-level `call()` in the `withdraw` function without checking the return value. If the call fails, the contract does not revert, and the balance of the sender is still set to 0, leading to potential loss of funds.",1010,59,5.525007724761963
69,unchecked low level calls,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `Command` function, where the low-level call `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)` is used without checking the return value. This can lead to potential vulnerabilities if the call fails, as the failure will not revert the transaction, and the contract will continue execution. This unchecked call can result in loss of funds or unexpected behavior.",1133,74,11.39053988456726
70,unchecked low level calls,"YES. The contract is vulnerable because the `call` function in the `transfer` function is still being used without checking the return value. This issue remains the same as in the first contract. Additionally, in the `get` function, the use of `.transfer()` can also be problematic in some cases, as it has a gas limit of 2300, which may lead to failure if the recipient's fallback function requires more gas, but this is not the primary vulnerability here. The unchecked low-level `call` remains the critical issue.",1063,109,22.914506196975708
71,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of low-level calls in the `sendMoney` function at line 38: 

```solidity
_target.call.value(_value)();

73,front running,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The contract is susceptible to front-running attacks. Specifically:

- In the `setReward` function, anyone can observe a transaction being sent to set a reward and potentially front-run it by sending their own transaction with higher gas fees to manipulate the reward transfer.
- Similarly, in the `claimReward` function, a malicious user can observe the original transaction trying to claim the reward and send their own claim with a higher gas fee, thereby preempting the legitimate user's transaction.",1106,101,5.376272201538086
74,front running,"YES

The contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks due to the same issue in the `solve` function, specifically the line:

```
require(hash == sha3(solution));
```

As explained earlier, the solution to the hash is publicly visible once submitted in a transaction. A malicious actor can monitor the mempool for the transaction revealing the solution, copy it, and submit a transaction with a higher gas fee, front-running the original solution submission and draining the contract’s funds.",1052,96,11.967714309692383
75,front running,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the function `approve(address spender, uint256 value)`, similar to the previously mentioned contract.

76,front running,"YES

The contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks, particularly at the `play(uint number)` function. Just like in the previous version of the contract, a malicious user could observe the first player's transaction, determine the number they chose, and then submit their own transaction with a higher gas fee, thereby winning the game unfairly. This is due to the fact that the number is publicly visible in pending transactions before it is confirmed on-chain, which allows for the front-running attack.",1325,96,5.670024871826172
77,arithmetic,"YES, the contract is vulnerable due to the same issue as before: an arithmetic underflow on line 21, where `map[k] -= v`.

84,arithmetic,"YES

The smart contract contains a vulnerability due to the potential for integer underflow in the `run` function at the line:
```solidity
uint res = count - input;
```
If `input` is greater than `count`, the subtraction will result in an underflow, as `uint` types in Solidity cannot represent negative numbers, leading to an incorrect result. This vulnerability can cause unintended behavior and potentially open up other attack vectors.

Additionally, though the main focus is on arithmetic, the use of `transfer` functions could introduce issues if not properly handled, such as reentrancy vulnerabilities, but the primary vulnerability here remains the arithmetic underflow.",888,133,13.16399884223938

This allows malicious users to manipulate the outcome, compromising the security of the contract.",1181,81,6.782238483428955
92,bad randomness,"YES

The contract is vulnerable due to the same issues with randomness as the previous version. Specifically, the contract relies on block properties and external factors such as:

1. **Line 99**: `address seed1 = contestants[uint(block.coinbase) % totalTickets].addr;`  
   The `block.coinbase` is controlled by miners, which makes it a poor source of randomness, as miners can manipulate this value.

2. **Line 101**: `address seed2 = contestants[uint(msg.sender) % totalTickets].addr;`  
   The `msg.sender` can also be controlled by the person calling the function, making it predictable and allowing manipulation.

3. **Line 103**: `uint seed3 = block.difficulty;`  
   While `block.difficulty` seems random, it is still influenced by the blockchain's state and can be predicted or manipulated to some extent.

These sources are predictable and can be exploited by malicious actors to influence the outcome of the raffle, making the contract vulnerable.",2741,211,21.054723262786865
93,bad randomness,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable due to the same randomness issue in the `rand` function. This function depends on the block's hash (`block.blockhash`) and block number (`block.number`), which can be influenced by miners, making the randomness predictable and manipulable. This makes it susceptible to attacks where malicious actors can predict the outcome and exploit the contract.",2879,74,12.946228265762329
94,bad randomness,"YES

The vulnerability exists because the contract still relies on block properties for randomness:

- **Line 40**: `bool won = (block.number % 2) == 0;` — This introduces a vulnerability by using the block number for randomness, which can be influenced or predicted by miners.
  
Additionally, the **`get()` function** contains a critical issue:

- The function transfers the entire balance of the contract to two specific addresses, which is dangerous and could lead to fund mismanagement or loss.

Thus, the contract is vulnerable.",1309,111,10.58634090423584
95,bad randomness,"YES

The vulnerability in this smart contract is similar to the previous one. The randomness used to generate the `answer` is based on `block.blockhash(block.number - 1)` and `now` (the current timestamp). These sources are predictable and can be manipulated by miners or attackers who have knowledge of the block's hash and timestamp. As a result, the randomness is not secure, and malicious users can potentially exploit this predictability to guess the correct answer and drain the contract's funds.",1073,100,12.967692136764526

It is vulnerable because it still relies on predictable values like `block.timestamp`, `block.number`, and `blockhash`, which can be influenced or predicted by malicious actors. These lines (e.g., lines 12, 18, 20, and 22) make the randomness generation insecure, just as in the previous example. Additionally, the use of `block.timestamp` as a source of randomness remains vulnerable to manipulation by miners, and `blockhash` is limited in its unpredictability for future blocks.",1124,105,10.231260061264038

106,reentrancy,"YES

The contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. This vulnerability is found in the `Collect` function at line 55:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This line transfers the requested amount of `_am` to the `msg.sender` using the low-level `call.value()`. The problem arises because the `call` function allows the recipient to execute code in its fallback function (if it exists) before the state changes in the calling contract are completed. This can lead to the attacker re-entering the `Collect` function multiple times before the contract's state is updated, allowing them to drain more funds than they are entitled to. 

In this case, the contract doesn't update the sender's balance until after the funds have been transferred, which is the main cause of the reentrancy vulnerability. To fix this, the state (balance update) should be updated before transferring funds to the external contract.",1656,193,6.445740699768066

127,time manipulation,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable to both **time manipulation** and **reentrancy risks**:

1. **Time Manipulation**: The contract relies on `block.timestamp` in the `isSaleFinished` function. As mentioned, miners can manipulate this value to a certain degree, making the contract vulnerable to time manipulation attacks.

2. **Reentrancy Risk**: The `get` function transfers half of the contract's balance to one address, then the remaining balance to another address without using proper checks (e.g., using the `transfer` function directly). This may expose the contract to a reentrancy attack if either of the external addresses executes malicious code during the transfer.",938,140,9.131736993789673
128,time manipulation,"YES

The contract is vulnerable due to its reliance on `block.timestamp` (or `now`) for determining payout eligibility and random number generation, which can be manipulated by miners. Specifically:

- **Line 13**: The condition `if ( rand> 0 && now - rand > 24 hours )` allows manipulation of time by miners, making the contract susceptible to attacks based on miner-controlled timestamps.
  
- **Line 27**: The use of `block.timestamp` for generating randomness is insecure, as it can be influenced by miners, leading to poor randomness and potential exploitation.",1173,120,8.913539171218872
129,time manipulation,"YES

The contract is vulnerable due to the reliance on `block.timestamp` in line 27 for critical functionality. Miners can manipulate the timestamp to slightly adjust it, which can affect the condition in the `resetInvestment()` function that relies on the one-minute interval. This manipulation can allow an attacker to reset the investment or influence the behavior of the contract in their favor.",1341,75,5.922281265258789
130,time manipulation,"**YES**

The smart contract is vulnerable due to the same issues as the previous one:

1. **Time Manipulation Vulnerability:**
   The contract uses `now` (which is the block timestamp) to control logic in the game. This introduces a vulnerability because the block timestamp can be manipulated by miners within a certain range. Miners have the ability to slightly adjust the timestamp, which could allow them to manipulate the contract's behavior, particularly the condition `now % 15 == 0`. This could be exploited by a miner or attacker to trigger the condition when it benefits them.

2. **Reentrancy Risk (Indirectly):**
   In the fallback function, the contract transfers funds to the caller using `msg.sender.transfer(this.balance)`. Although this may not seem directly vulnerable, if combined with other attacks or unforeseen contract behavior, it can potentially be a vector for a reentrancy attack, particularly if external calls (like the `get()` function) interact with other contracts.",1040,201,4.4717185497283936
131,time manipulation,"YES, the contract is vulnerable because it still relies on `block.timestamp` for randomness in line 43:

```solidity
var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;
```

As mentioned earlier, using `block.timestamp` allows miners to manipulate the outcome, making the contract vulnerable to time manipulation exploits.",1150,67,12.87114429473877
132,short addresses,"YES

The vulnerability in the provided smart contract is due to the use of hardcoded addresses in the `get` function, which sends Ether to two specific addresses. This presents a potential issue of trust, as the contract sends funds to fixed addresses that could belong to an attacker or be compromised. Additionally, the contract does not implement access control, allowing any user to call the `get` function and trigger the transfer of funds.",1198,86,7.94928765296936
133,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable due to a potential denial of service (DoS) attack. Specifically, in the `get()` function, transferring the contract's balance to two external addresses can fail if one of the recipients is a contract that has a fallback function with specific conditions or runs out of gas during the transfer. This can cause the entire transaction to fail, leading to a DoS situation where funds are locked and other parts of the contract cannot function as intended.",1166,95,10.451725959777832
134,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `get()` function, which transfers the contract's balance to specific addresses. This can be exploited if the recipient addresses are contracts that can revert transactions, causing a denial of service by preventing future transfers or causing the function to fail, thus halting the contract's functionality. Additionally, if the balance is drained, subsequent calls to `get()` will fail, further exacerbating the denial of service.",1266,92,8.50857949256897
135,denial of service,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable due to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability caused by sending funds to external addresses, specifically within the loop where `creditorAddresses[lastCreditorPayedOut].send(creditorAmounts[lastCreditorPayedOut])` is called. If the recipient address (a creditor) is a contract that consumes excessive gas or deliberately reverts the transaction, it could prevent the execution of the contract, blocking future payouts to other creditors. This can lead to a permanent denial of service for other users trying to interact with the contract.",2240,116,10.881113052368164
136,denial of service,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the same logic as in the previous contract, specifically in the `refundAll` function at line 24:  
`require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));`

This can cause a denial of service if one of the addresses in `refundAddresses` cannot accept funds (e.g., due to running out of gas or rejecting the transfer). This will prevent the loop from continuing, causing the whole `refundAll` function to fail and halting all refunds.",1149,110,16.55176830291748
137,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `get()` function. If any of the addresses provided (`0x20C945800de43394F70D789874a4daC9cFA57451` or `0x83c0Efc6d8B16D87BFe1335AB6BcAb3Ed3960285`) is a contract, it could reject the transaction or consume more gas than expected. This can prevent the function from completing, causing a **Denial of Service (DoS)** by preventing further interactions with the contract. Additionally, because the contract transfers the entire balance, it leaves no funds for future transactions.",1043,134,9.548438310623169
138,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable because `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` could fail if the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that does not implement a fallback function or if its fallback function consumes more gas than the stipend allows. This could lead to a denial of service, preventing future bids from being placed.",1036,68,9.423090696334839
