- The `send()` function is used in two locations:
  - Line 54: `owner2.send(sum2);`
  - Line 65: `owner.send(balance);`
  
  The issue with `send()` is that it only forwards a limited amount of gas (2300), and if the recipient is a contract, its fallback function might fail. Additionally, the return value of `send()` is not checked, which can lead to failures not being handled properly.

2. Line 118: `msg.sender.send(excessPaid);`
3. Line 132: `currentMonarch.etherAddress.send(compensation);`

78,arithmetic,"YES

The smart contract remains vulnerable to an integer overflow in the `run` function.

The vulnerability lies in the same line as the previous contract:

- Line 22: `uint256 h = uint256(blockhash(seed));` uses blockhash, which is predictable for recent blocks and not a secure source of randomness.

109,reentrancy,"YES, it is vulnerable. The reentrancy vulnerability occurs because the `airDrop` function, which updates the contract's state (by modifying `tokenBalance`), is callable from the `supportsToken` modifier.
