11,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function, which allows any external account to assign themselves as an owner by specifying any valid address, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control of the contract. This issue arises because there is no restriction or validation that ensures the caller has sufficient privileges to assign new owners, making it an access control vulnerability.",1310,75,6.3632142543792725
12,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `missing` function of the `Missing` contract. This function, which sets the owner of the contract, can be called by anyone because it lacks the `onlyowner` modifier, allowing any user to overwrite the `owner` address. This exposes the contract to access control issues, as malicious users can take over ownership and withdraw the contract's balance.",1048,78,4.8672497272491455
13,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `DynamicPyramid` function's definition. In the provided smart contract, `DynamicPyramid()` is defined as a function, but in Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, it is treated as a constructor because it has the same name as the contract. This can lead to a critical issue when the contract is renamed or refactored, as the function `DynamicPyramid` would no longer be recognized as a constructor but instead as a regular function. 

This allows any user to call it and change the `creator` address, granting them access to the contract's privileged functions that use the `onlyowner` modifier. Thus, the attacker could become the new ""owner"" of the contract and take full control, making this an **access control vulnerability**.",2968,164,12.572244644165039
14,access control,"YES, the vulnerability exists because the `withdraw` function has a flawed check on line 21. The `require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);` should instead be `require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);`. The current condition incorrectly allows withdrawal of amounts greater than the user's balance, which would result in potential over-withdrawals.",1165,66,6.378361940383911
15,access control,"YES. It is vulnerable because in the `Missing` contract, the function `IamMissing` is public, allowing anyone to call it and overwrite the owner variable. This effectively allows any user to take ownership of the contract, bypassing the intended access control, as the `onlyowner` modifier becomes meaningless once the ownership is transferred to an attacker.",1058,70,3.9395508766174316
16,access control,"YES. It is vulnerable because the `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract relies on the `onlyOwner` modifier to control access. However, the `onlyOwner` modifier in the `Ownable` contract does not properly prevent reentrancy attacks or ensure that ownership cannot be transferred or compromised. Additionally, the function does not return a boolean indicating the success of the ERC20 token transfers, which could lead to unchecked transfer failures. This introduces potential access control issues where a malicious actor could exploit these vulnerabilities.",1123,109,6.124295234680176
17,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of `delegatecall` in the `Proxy` contract. `delegatecall` allows external contracts to be executed in the context of the calling contract, which can lead to access control issues if the called contract is untrusted. In this case, anyone can call the `forward` function and execute arbitrary code via `callee.delegatecall(_data)` with no proper access control, potentially compromising the contract.",1026,93,7.630875110626221
18,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `PopBonusCode` function of the `Wallet` contract, where the line `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length);` is always true because array lengths are unsigned and cannot be negative. This condition doesn't provide any meaningful access control. Additionally, there's no restriction on who can call this function, allowing anyone to reduce the length of the `bonusCodes` array, which could result in unintended behavior or logic errors.

Moreover, in the `Airdropper` contract, while the `onlyOwner` modifier is used, the visibility of the `owner` variable is public, making it easier for an attacker to identify and target the owner.",1219,141,8.760684490203857
19,access control,"YES, the vulnerability lies in the `Constructor` function. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, the function name needs to exactly match the contract name to be treated as a constructor. Since the function is named `Constructor` and not `Missing` (which is the contract name), it is treated as a regular public function instead of a constructor. This allows anyone to call `Constructor` and take ownership of the contract, leading to an access control vulnerability.",1048,96,8.636942148208618
20,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `initWallet` function, which is publicly accessible, allowing any user to reinitialize the `creator` variable. This effectively grants any user control over the contract, bypassing the intended access control.",1183,47,5.73346471786499
21,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability arises because the `sendTo` function in the `MyContract` contract still uses `tx.origin` for access control. Using `tx.origin` is insecure because it can be manipulated in a phishing attack where a contract is called via another contract, tricking `tx.origin` to be the original user who initiated the transaction. This can lead to unauthorized access to the contract's functions.",1015,89,7.28585410118103
22,access control,"YES. The vulnerability exists in the `Wallet` contract's `refund` function. There is no access control mechanism, which means **any user can call this function to withdraw their entire balance** without any restrictions. This could lead to unintended withdrawals or abuse. Furthermore, in the `Airdropper` contract, if a large number of addresses and values are passed to the `multisend` function, it can cause **gas limit issues**, making the transaction fail. This function also lacks access control to verify the validity of inputs.",1203,109,6.943296432495117
23,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in this case is primarily related to the `SimpleSuicide` contract, which allows anyone to trigger the `selfdestruct(msg.sender)` function. This results in the contract's balance being sent to the caller (whoever calls the function). The contract does not have proper access control, allowing any arbitrary caller to destroy the contract and take any funds it holds.

In summary, the vulnerability is an access control issue in the `sudicideAnyone` function within `SimpleSuicide`, allowing anyone to destroy the contract without restriction.",974,116,7.314083814620972
24,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because the `changeOwner` function lacks the `onlyOwner` modifier, allowing anyone to change the owner of the contract without restriction.

A better approach would be to use `msg.sender` for secure access control.",1033,72,5.547904968261719
26,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the reckless use of `delegatecall` in the `FibonacciBalance` contract, particularly in lines 31 and 38, where `delegatecall` allows execution of arbitrary code from the `fibonacciLibrary` contract. This could lead to access control issues because `delegatecall` executes the code in the context of the caller contract (`FibonacciBalance`), which could potentially be manipulated to execute unauthorized actions or access private data. Additionally, no proper access control mechanisms (e.g., `onlyOwner` modifiers) are in place to restrict who can invoke these functions.",1449,121,8.2455153465271
27,unchecked low level calls,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);` in the `Command` function of the `Pie` contract. This low-level call does not check the return value, which can lead to potential issues, such as failing silently if the call does not succeed, opening the contract to potential security vulnerabilities, including reentrancy attacks or failed executions that are not properly handled.",1430,81,6.681341171264648
28,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The second contract code is vulnerable. Specifically, it lacks checks for the success of low-level calls. In the `multisend` function, the `ERC20(_tokenAddr).transfer(dests[i], values[i])` does not check the return value of the `transfer` function, which may return `false` if the transfer fails. This could lead to incorrect assumptions about the success of transfers, which is a common source of vulnerabilities in smart contracts.",1761,95,6.747795820236206
29,unchecked low level calls,"YES. The vulnerability exists in the use of the `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);` on line 39 of the first contract (`Freebie`). This is a low-level call that does not check the return value, meaning if the call fails, the transaction does not revert, potentially leading to a fail-open condition or other unintended behavior.

This unchecked low-level call could result in funds being sent or actions being executed without proper handling of failures, making the contract susceptible to vulnerabilities.",1338,98,8.074436664581299
30,unchecked low level calls,"YES. The vulnerability is present because in the first contract, multiple `send()` calls are used without checking their return values. Specifically, in lines 110, 118, 132, and 174, there are unchecked `send()` operations. These low-level calls can fail and the failure will not propagate, leading to potential vulnerabilities such as loss of funds or unexpected behavior. This is the same vulnerability as in the original contract you highlighted.

In contrast, the second contract `Airdropper` uses a transfer mechanism via `ERC20.transfer()`, which is generally safer because it reverts on failure. However, the first contract remains vulnerable due to the unchecked `send()` calls.",2627,139,8.61350679397583

37,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is in the use of the low-level `call()` function in the `Centra4` contract. Specifically, on line 21, the code uses `contract_address.call(""register"", ""CentraToken"");` without checking the return value of the `call()`. This can result in a fail-open scenario, where the `call()` may fail, but the code will continue executing without reverting. This creates a risk of unwanted behavior or a potential security issue if the call fails but the transfer function continues to run.
