11,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function, which allows any external account to add themselves as a new owner by calling the function with their own address. There is no proper access control mechanism ensuring that only an existing owner can add a new owner.

12,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `missing()` function, which can be called by anyone since it is a public function.

13,access control,"YES

The contract is vulnerable because of the same issue as before: the constructor function `DynamicPyramid()` allows anyone to call it, setting themselves as the `creator`. This allows attackers to gain ownership of the contract and exploit functions protected by the `onlyowner` modifier.",2993,56,6.1674089431762695
14,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable because the function `canCall` defines specific addresses and signatures that are allowed to interact with the contract without proper access control measures.

16,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `canCall` function. The access control in this function is not robust because it hardcodes specific addresses and function signatures to determine who can call certain functions. This approach is weak and prone to exploitation, as an attacker can gain control if they are able to manipulate the contract's conditions or if the trusted addresses are compromised.

Moreover, using hardcoded addresses for access control is not scalable or flexible and exposes the contract to potential vulnerabilities if these addresses are reused elsewhere. The access control mechanism should be more dynamic and comprehensive.",1147,111,8.96967339515686
17,access control,"YES. The contract is vulnerable due to improper access control. The `forward` function uses `delegatecall` without ensuring that only authorized users can call it, which could allow unauthorized users to execute malicious code in the context of the contract.

18,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the **access control logic** within the `canCall` function. Specifically, the function restricts access based on hardcoded addresses and function signatures. This design is vulnerable because:

1. **Hardcoding Addresses**: The contract relies on specific hardcoded addresses (`0x5bAa39204292f844Fd6D76b2c199611446687906` and `0x7f2b654f7D4258F2F01b105ddaA2a26F8843B18b`). If these addresses are compromised, unauthorized entities could call the contractâ€™s functions.

2. **Function Signature Restriction**: The contract allows access to functions based on specific signatures (`0xccee8047` and `0x158048a0`). If these signatures are reused or intercepted, it could allow malicious actors to bypass security checks.

This access control method is fragile and can easily be bypassed or exploited, leading to potential unauthorized function calls or privilege escalation.",1243,207,11.997852563858032
19,access control,"YES. The contract is vulnerable because the constructor function is incorrectly named `Constructor` instead of `constructor` (case-sensitive in Solidity). As a result, this function will not be executed when the contract is deployed, meaning the `owner` variable will never be initialized. This allows anyone to call the `withdraw` function and drain the contract's balance, leading to an access control vulnerability.",1072,78,6.738360404968262
20,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the **access control** mechanism of the `canCall` function. The function allows certain addresses (`src`) to interact with a specific destination address (`dst`) or to execute certain function signatures (`sig`) without a more robust authorization mechanism. The hardcoded addresses and function signatures can be exploited if an attacker gains control over one of these addresses or signatures, potentially allowing unauthorized access or actions. The lack of a more flexible and secure access control system exposes the contract to risks such as privilege escalation or unauthorized function calls.",1207,115,7.2179951667785645
21,access control,"YES. The contract is vulnerable because it uses `tx.origin` for authentication in the `sendTo` function (`require(tx.origin == owner)`).

The correct approach would be to use `msg.sender` to verify the caller.",1039,77,6.873381853103638
22,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `canCall` function. It provides inadequate access control as it allows certain hardcoded addresses to call the contract's functions without proper authorization mechanisms. Specifically, any external user can check if they can execute certain functions (`sig`) on the contract, which can be exploited if these function signatures correspond to sensitive contract operations. Moreover, using hardcoded addresses and function signatures can lead to potential security risks, such as unauthorized access to contract functionalities.",1227,94,5.4353508949279785
23,access control,"YES. The function `sudicideAnyone()` allows anyone to trigger `selfdestruct(msg.sender)`, transferring the contract's funds to `msg.sender`.

24,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `changeOwner` function. It does not implement any access control, allowing anyone to call this function and change the contract's owner.

The use of `tx.origin` is considered insecure as it can be manipulated in phishing attacks, making this a classic access control issue.",1057,89,7.395200729370117
26,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The use of `delegatecall` in lines 31 and 38 introduces an access control vulnerability. Specifically, `delegatecall` allows the `FibonacciBalance` contract to execute code in the context of the `fibonacciLibrary` contract, which can be exploited. This makes it possible for an attacker to hijack the contract by changing the library's address or passing malicious data to functions that rely on `delegatecall`. Furthermore, there is no proper access control in place to restrict who can call the fallback function or the `withdraw` function, which could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the contract.",1473,130,10.023689031600952

The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` for the `lastInvestmentTimestamp` in the `invest()` function and in the condition within the `resetInvestment()` function.

This makes the contract susceptible to time manipulation by miners, who can influence the timestamp to exploit the contract's logic.

137,denial of service,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the same issue in the `ifillArray` function as in the previous contract: the loop on line 27 (`for(uint i=0;i<350;i++)`) and the `listAddresses.push(msg.sender)` operation can potentially cause a denial of service (DoS) by consuming too much gas. If the `listAddresses` array grows large enough, the gas required to execute the loop will exceed the block gas limit, causing the transaction to fail and effectively preventing further execution of the function.",1124,113,26.46875810623169
138,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the same line:

```solidity
require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));
```

This can lead to a **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack. If the `send` function fails (due to the recipient contract rejecting payments, having a fallback function that uses too much gas, or having other issues), the entire transaction will revert, blocking the new bid and preventing the auction from progressing. This allows the current frontrunner to block new bids intentionally or unintentionally.",1117,110,7.2958762645721436
