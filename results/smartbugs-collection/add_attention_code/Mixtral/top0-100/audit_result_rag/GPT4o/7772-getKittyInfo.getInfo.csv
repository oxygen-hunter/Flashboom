An attacker could exploit this by repeatedly calling the `Collect` function before the state (such as the account balance) is updated, allowing them to drain funds from the contract.",1696,102,7.1930930614471436
103,reentrancy,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable due to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the line where the contract uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. This low-level call sends Ether to the external address (in this case, `msg.sender`) without updating the contract state (such as `acc.balance`) before making the external call. This allows an attacker to re-enter the contract, repeatedly calling the `Collect` function to drain the contract’s funds before the balance is updated.",1870,101,6.103118896484375
104,reentrancy,"YES, it is vulnerable because the `withdrawReward` function in the `Reentrancy_bonus` contract allows for a reentrancy attack. Specifically, in the `getFirstWithdrawalBonus` function, the state-changing action `claimedBonus[recipient] = true;` occurs **after** calling `withdrawReward(recipient)`. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call `getFirstWithdrawalBonus` through a reentrant call before the state update is made, exploiting the contract.",1333,96,6.957042455673218
105,reentrancy,"YES. 

The vulnerability lies in the line:
```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```
This allows an external contract to make a reentrant call before the original execution is completed, which can lead to a reentrancy attack. The attacker can repeatedly withdraw funds before the contract's state is updated, potentially draining the contract.",1864,72,7.775305271148682
106,reentrancy,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function, where `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` is used. This allows an external contract to reenter the `Collect` function before the execution is complete, enabling a reentrancy attack.",1824,51,7.142306804656982
107,reentrancy,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to a **reentrancy attack**. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs in the `Collect` function at the line:
```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This line transfers Ether to `msg.sender` using a low-level call, which allows `msg.sender` to re-enter the contract before the `acc.balance -= _am;` line is executed. This reentrancy can be exploited by an attacker to call the `Collect` function repeatedly and drain funds from the contract before the balance is updated.",1704,116,8.343961000442505
108,reentrancy,NO,1790,1,29.586824417114258
109,reentrancy,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to a **reentrancy attack** in the `airDrop()` function. The `supportsToken` modifier calls an external contract (`Bank` or `attack` contract in this case) to check if the token is supported. The external contract (`attack`) can manipulate this call to recursively invoke `airDrop()` before the initial execution of the function is completed, exploiting the contract's logic and allowing reentrancy, which could result in the contract state being changed in an unintended manner. Specifically, the `attack` contract can call `airDrop()` again in its `supportsToken()` function before the original `airDrop()` completes.",1475,135,7.525872707366943
110,reentrancy,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the use of the low-level call function at line 44: `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())`. This allows for a potential reentrancy attack, where an attacker can repeatedly call the `CashOut` function before the original call is completed, potentially draining the contract of its funds before the balance is updated.",1646,72,15.388945579528809
111,reentrancy,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function, specifically in the following line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This call allows an external contract to execute code before the state of the `balances` mapping is updated. An attacker could exploit this by repeatedly calling the `Collect` function before the balance is reduced, draining the contract's funds.",1820,91,6.2044689655303955
112,reentrancy,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawAll` function, where `msg.sender.call.value(oCredit)()` allows for an external contract to call back into the same function before the initial execution is complete, leading to a reentrancy attack.",1250,54,4.606734991073608

The contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `CashOut` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This line makes a call to an external address (`msg.sender`) and transfers Ether, without following it up with state updates immediately. The contract deducts the amount from the `balances` mapping **after** the external call. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the `CashOut` function before the balance is updated, enabling them to drain funds from the contract.",1610,117,7.172726631164551
115,reentrancy,"YES. The given smart contract is vulnerable due to a reentrancy attack in the `CashOut` function. Specifically, the line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())` allows an external contract to make recursive calls back into `CashOut` before the contract state (`balances[msg.sender] -= _am`) is updated. This can be exploited to repeatedly withdraw funds, effectively draining the contract.",1610,82,7.81780743598938
116,reentrancy,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function where the contract allows external calls using `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`.

118,reentrancy,"YES

It is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack due to the use of `msg.sender.call.value(userBalance[msg.sender])()` in the `withdrawBalance` function, where the contract sends Ether to the calling address without updating the balance first. This allows an attacker to reenter the contract by calling the function again before the balance is set to 0, repeatedly draining the contract.",1231,78,8.02144742012024
119,reentrancy,"YES, it is vulnerable because the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `CashOut` function allows external calls before updating the contract's state.

125,reentrancy,"YES

The contract is vulnerable to a **reentrancy attack**. Specifically, in the `Collect` function, the line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())` (line 54) is the issue. It uses a low-level `call` to transfer Ether, which allows an external contract (the recipient) to execute code before the state is updated (i.e., before `balances[msg.sender] -= _am`). This means an attacker could re-enter the contract and repeatedly withdraw funds before the balance is properly reduced, draining the contract's funds.",1740,115,8.642162799835205
126,reentrancy,"YES

The vulnerability in the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract lies in the `withdrawBalance` function. Specifically, the line:

```solidity
(bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""");
```

At this point, control is transferred to the external address (`msg.sender`). If `msg.sender` is a contract, it can call `withdrawBalance` again before the previous execution completes, allowing for a reentrancy attack. This is because the balance is updated **after** the external call, leaving a window for exploitation.",1198,114,6.679407358169556
127,time manipulation,NO,1106,1,2.1424360275268555
128,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable because the code relies on `block.timestamp` for randomness generation (line 27: `return block.timestamp;`), which can be manipulated by miners to their advantage. This makes the smart contract susceptible to time manipulation vulnerabilities.",1341,50,5.630561351776123
129,time manipulation,"YES. 

The smart contract is vulnerable due to its reliance on `block.timestamp`, specifically in the `resetInvestment` function where it checks if enough time has passed since the last investment. This makes it vulnerable to time manipulation by miners, as they can adjust the timestamp slightly to meet the conditions for resetting the investment.",1509,64,6.36229395866394
130,time manipulation,"YES. It is vulnerable due to the reliance on `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) in both contracts. The `Roulette` contract can be manipulated by miners as they have control over the block's timestamp, allowing them to potentially exploit the condition where `now % 15 == 0` to win the game. This is a classic case of timestamp manipulation vulnerability.",1208,77,6.354270935058594
131,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` in the line `var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;`, which makes the contract susceptible to time manipulation.

It is vulnerable due to the same issue as previously mentioned: a potential **denial of service (DoS)** vulnerability in the `insertNnumbers` function. Specifically, this vulnerability lies in the dynamic resizing of the `array` within the `for` loop.

137,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in the contract is a potential **Denial of Service (DoS)** due to the loop in the `ifillArray` function. Specifically, the loop (`for(uint i=0;i<350;i++)`) at lines 17-18, which adds 350 addresses to `listAddresses`. If `listAddresses` becomes large enough (approaching the gas limit), this operation could fail due to gas constraints, making it impossible to successfully execute the function.
