11,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the **`newOwner`** function of the `MultiOwnable` contract. Specifically, there is an access control issue because **anyone** can call the `newOwner` function and add themselves or another address as an owner. This is a critical vulnerability since it allows unauthorized users to gain ownership privileges, leading to potential misuse of contract functions like `withdrawAll` in `TestContract`.",1292,91,7.7658021450042725
12,access control,"YES. 

The vulnerability in the ""Missing"" contract is due to improper access control. Specifically, the function `missing()` is a public function that allows anyone to call it and set themselves as the owner of the contract. This means that any malicious user can take over the ownership of the contract and subsequently call the `withdraw()` function to transfer all funds from the contract, leading to a complete loss of funds. 

In the ""Foo"" contract, there is no explicit access control mechanism for the `doit()` function. As a result, anyone can call this function and initiate a transfer of tokens, which can lead to unauthorized token transfers. This makes both contracts vulnerable due to insufficient access control.",1030,141,6.611811399459839
13,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the **constructor function** of the `Rubixi` contract, specifically in:

```solidity
function DynamicPyramid() {
    creator = msg.sender;  
}
```

This function is incorrectly named as `DynamicPyramid` instead of the contract name `Rubixi` (as per Solidity versions < 0.5.0). This means anyone can call the function after deployment and reset the `creator` variable, gaining control of the contract, leading to an **access control vulnerability**.",2950,107,7.696745872497559
14,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function in the `Wallet` contract. The condition `require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);` should instead check `require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);`, as the current check allows users to withdraw funds even when they have insufficient balance, which is an access control vulnerability. Additionally, in the `Foo` contract, blindly transferring tokens without proper authorization checks can lead to security issues.",1147,86,7.713303804397583
15,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `IamMissing` function. It allows anyone to call the function and set themselves as the owner of the contract. This is an access control issue because there is no restriction on who can become the owner, making the contract vulnerable to unauthorized ownership takeover.",1040,57,4.029536962509155
16,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the access control of the `set` function in the `Map` contract. This function allows anyone to modify the values in the `map` array, including changing values that could affect the contract's logic or state. Since there is no access control mechanism like `onlyOwner`, any external account can call this function and potentially cause harm by manipulating the contract's internal state.

Additionally, the `Foo` contract also has a potential vulnerability: it uses `token.balanceOf(0x9e518098BB49354bc4372d48D3474d8C1F2eddF8)` without checking the authorization or the source of the tokens, allowing unauthorized token transfers.",1105,144,8.263802528381348
17,access control,"YES. The contract is vulnerable because it uses `delegatecall` in the `Proxy` contract without proper access control. Specifically, the `forward` function allows any external caller to trigger the `delegatecall` to an arbitrary contract with arbitrary data.

18,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The `PopBonusCode` function allows any user to decrease the `bonusCodes` array length without any ownership or access control checks. This could lead to potential manipulation of the contract's internal state, such as deleting stored bonus codes. Moreover, the `Foo` contract's `doit` function lacks proper authorization checks, allowing any caller to trigger token transfers to arbitrary addresses without restriction. These issues present access control vulnerabilities.",1201,91,8.007020950317383
19,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the function `Constructor()`. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, constructors must have the same name as the contract, which in this case should be `Missing`, not `Constructor`. As a result, the function `Constructor()` is treated as a regular public function, allowing anyone to call it and reassign the `owner` variable, thus bypassing access control. This allows an attacker to take ownership of the contract and withdraw all funds.",1030,99,9.40048599243164
20,access control,"YES. 

The vulnerability lies in the `initWallet()` function, which can be called by anyone to reset the `creator` address. This allows any external user to take control of the wallet and perform privileged operations, such as calling `migrateTo()` to transfer the entire balance to an arbitrary address. This is a clear **access control** issue, as there are no restrictions preventing unauthorized users from becoming the `creator` of the wallet.",1165,90,7.172521591186523
21,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the use of `tx.origin == owner` in the `sendTo` function for access control. This is insecure because `tx.origin` can be manipulated in a phishing attack, allowing an attacker to trick the contract owner into calling the contract through a malicious contract. This can bypass proper access control and allow unauthorized access to the contract's funds.",997,75,8.292445421218872
22,access control,"YES

The vulnerability is due to improper access control in the `refund()` function in the `Wallet` contract. Any user can call the `refund()` function and withdraw the full balance associated with their address, without any restrictions or validation. This could allow an attacker to drain their balance completely. Additionally, in the `migrateTo()` function, the entire contract's balance can be transferred to any address by the `creator`, which could pose risks if the `creator`'s private key is compromised. 

These access control weaknesses could be exploited to manipulate the contract's funds.",1185,117,7.261381149291992
23,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `SimpleSuicide` contract, specifically in the `sudicideAnyone` function, which allows anyone to call the function and execute `selfdestruct(msg.sender)`. This function transfers all the contract's Ether to the caller (the person who triggered the transaction). Since there is no access control mechanism to restrict who can call this function, it poses a serious vulnerability. 

Additionally, in the `Foo` contract, there is a `require` statement that allows transferring the entire token balance from the contract at a specific address without any access control checks. An attacker could exploit this function to drain the contract's funds by specifying any address as the beneficiary. This is another access control issue.",956,146,8.132734537124634
24,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable due to the lack of proper access control in the `changeOwner` function of the `Unprotected` contract. This function allows anyone to change the owner of the contract without any restrictions, which is a clear access control vulnerability.",1037,52,4.473633050918579
25,access control,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable because it uses `tx.origin` in the `Phishable` contract to validate the caller. This type of access control is unsafe since `tx.origin` can be spoofed in phishing attacks, allowing attackers to manipulate transactions to withdraw funds. An attacker could trick the owner into interacting with a malicious contract, which then calls the `withdrawAll` function and passes the owner's address as `tx.origin`, thereby draining the contract's balance.

Additionally, the `Foo` contract might also expose risks depending on how the `IERC20Token` implementation handles transfers, but the primary vulnerability here lies in the unsafe use of `tx.origin` in the `Phishable` contract.",1015,141,8.97685432434082
26,access control,"YES

The vulnerability in this smart contract is primarily due to the **insecure use of `delegatecall`** on line 31 and line 38. The contract allows arbitrary calls to be made to the `fibonacciLibrary` via `delegatecall`. Since `delegatecall` executes code in the context of the calling contract (which can change the state of the calling contract), an attacker can exploit this to execute malicious code that modifies the contract's state or drains funds. The absence of proper access controls on these `delegatecall` invocations makes the contract vulnerable to malicious attacks.",1431,118,7.0594282150268555

28,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The vulnerability in the provided smart contract lies in the use of low-level calls without proper checks. Specifically:

1. **`owner2.send(sum2)` in `tokens_buy()` function**: The use of `send()` to transfer Ether is risky, as it may fail and return `false` without reverting the entire transaction. If the `send()` call fails, it does not stop the execution or notify that the transfer failed, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

2. **`owner.send(balance)` in `withdraw()` function**: Similarly, the `send()` method used here can fail, and it does not handle failure appropriately. This lack of error handling can result in funds not being transferred as intended while the function still returns `true`.

These lines introduce potential vulnerabilities if `send()` fails, leading to conditions where funds are not transferred as expected, but the contract acts as if they were. This behavior can lead to financial losses or inconsistencies in contract states.",1743,198,7.983510494232178

These arithmetic operations, without proper overflow checks, make the contract vulnerable to exploits.",1212,174,9.359362363815308
83,arithmetic,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the same line of code: `count -= input;`. Since Solidity version 0.4.23 does not have built-in checks for integer overflows and underflows, subtracting a large `input` from `count` (which starts as 1) can result in an underflow, causing `count` to wrap around to a very large value.

Since `count` is an unsigned integer (starting at 1), if the `input` value is greater than `count`, it will cause an underflow in Solidity versions before 0.8.0, which can lead to incorrect behavior.

Additionally, in the second contract (`Foo`), there is a potential issue with unchecked return values. The call to `token.transfer` does not check the returned boolean value. If the transfer fails, it could lead to unintended behavior.",927,132,8.947381019592285

The vulnerability in the first contract code persists because it still involves an arithmetic operation (`count -= input`) that could result in an integer underflow. If the `input` is larger than `count`, the subtraction will wrap around, causing `count` to become a very large number, leading to unexpected behavior.

This vulnerability is present in the modified version of the code as well.

Additionally, in the `Foo` contract, there's a potential issue where the `balanceOf` and `transfer` functions of the token are called without validating the token's address or handling potential failures beyond the `require` statement.

122,reentrancy,"YES. The contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack in the `CashOut` function. The line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())` sends Ether to the caller without updating the balance first, allowing the attacker to reenter the function and drain the contract's funds before the balance is reduced.",1471,64,5.276666164398193
123,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function, specifically at this line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This line makes an external call using the low-level `call` function, which can potentially trigger a reentrancy attack. The contract does not update the balance before making the external call, so an attacker can repeatedly call the `Collect` function to drain the contract's funds before the balance is updated.",1567,100,5.423195838928223
124,reentrancy,"YES

It is vulnerable due to a reentrancy attack risk in the `CashOut` function, specifically at the line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This external call allows the attacker to re-enter the contract before the balance is updated (`balances[msg.sender] -= _am;`). This could be exploited by repeatedly calling `CashOut` to drain the contract’s funds before the balance is updated.",1457,90,8.574584484100342
125,reentrancy,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function, which uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` on line 54. This low-level call allows for reentrancy, meaning an external contract can make repeated calls to the `Collect` function before the state changes (such as reducing the balance) are finalized, enabling potential exploits.",1611,70,8.471511363983154
126,reentrancy,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the fact that in the `withdrawBalance` function, the state is updated after an external call to `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""")`. This allows a reentrancy attack, where an attacker could re-enter the contract and call `withdrawBalance` multiple times before the balance is updated to 0, allowing them to withdraw more funds than they should be able to.",1069,88,6.362452030181885
127,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` in the `TimedCrowdsale` contract, which can be manipulated by miners, as explained before. Additionally, the `Foo` contract interacts with an external token contract, potentially leading to reentrancy vulnerabilities if the `transfer` function is improperly implemented in the token contract. This combination makes the code vulnerable to both time manipulation and possible reentrancy risks.",977,86,7.4636549949646
128,time manipulation,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable due to the use of `block.timestamp` for generating random numbers. This occurs in the `randomGen` function on line 27 with the code:

```solidity
return block.timestamp;
```

Using `block.timestamp` for randomness is insecure because miners can manipulate this value within a certain range, leading to potential exploitation in the randomness generation. Additionally, in line 13, the condition `if (rand > 0 && now - rand > 24 hours)` also relies on `now` (which is an alias for `block.timestamp`), making it vulnerable to time manipulation.",1212,126,7.432887077331543
129,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the reliance on `block.timestamp` in the `resetInvestment` function for time-dependent logic. This can be manipulated by miners to influence when the condition for resetting the investment is met, as they can slightly adjust the timestamp of blocks within certain limits, leading to potential exploitation.",1380,64,6.427859544754028
130,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is in the `Roulette` contract, specifically in the use of `now` (which is an alias for `block.timestamp`). Miners can manipulate the block timestamp, which introduces a risk of time manipulation. This vulnerability allows miners to control whether the condition `if(now % 15 == 0)` is met, giving them an opportunity to potentially exploit the contract and drain its funds. This reliance on `now` for randomness and as a key decision-making factor is the issue here.",1079,109,7.281096696853638
131,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability exists because it uses `block.timestamp` in the random number generation, specifically in the line:

```solidity
var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;
```

Since `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners within a certain range, it makes the contract susceptible to time-based manipulation, which could allow miners to influence the outcome of the random number generation, compromising the fairness of the game. This is a known issue when generating randomness using the block timestamp.",1189,108,6.642733097076416
132,short addresses,"YES, it is vulnerable.",1237,6,3.011465549468994
133,denial of service,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to the `emptyCreditors` function. When the length of `creditorAddresses` exceeds 1500, it attempts to reset the array with `creditorAddresses = new address ;`. This could lead to a denial of service due to the high gas cost required to clear a large array, potentially causing the function to fail due to out-of-gas issues, thus making it vulnerable to a gas-based denial-of-service attack.",1205,95,7.983645439147949
134,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, which uses a dynamic array resizing approach inside a loop. Specifically, the line:

```solidity
array.length += 1;
```

modifies the length of the array in each iteration of the loop, potentially causing an out-of-gas exception due to the increasing gas cost as the array grows. This can be exploited to create a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, where executing this function consumes excessive gas and may fail, preventing further operations on the contract.

This falls under the ""denial of service"" category, as described in the vulnerability type.",1305,129,8.13111662864685
135,denial of service,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to potential issues with resetting the arrays `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` to empty arrays (lines 46 and 48). These operations can be exploited, leading to denial of service by blocking new creditors from being added or existing creditors from being paid out. Additionally, if the `creditorAddresses` or `creditorAmounts` array grows too large, this could cause high gas costs, which may prevent the contract from executing within the gas limit.",2279,112,8.797372817993164
136,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in the `Refunder` contract lies in the use of `send` within a loop (`refundAll` function). If one of the addresses in `refundAddresses` fails to accept the transfer (e.g., it is a contract that has a fallback function which reverts or uses more than 2300 gas), the entire transaction will revert due to the `require` statement, causing a denial of service. This means that the refund process for all addresses will halt, blocking further refunds.",1188,109,8.123407125473022
137,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability exists in the `DosOneFunc` contract in the same way as described previously: the loop in the `ifillArray` function, which adds 350 elements to `listAddresses`, can lead to a denial of service. Specifically, as the number of iterations in the loop increases, it could consume excessive gas, causing transactions to fail due to running out of gas. This would make the contract non-functional once it exceeds the gas limit required to execute the loop.",1082,104,6.807170152664185
138,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability exists in the `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` line, which can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. If the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract with a fallback function that uses a significant amount of gas or intentionally fails, it will prevent the function from continuing, blocking further bids. This is a common ""denial of service with a failed send"" vulnerability, as the `send` function returns false upon failure, but here it is used with `require`, which halts the execution of the contract when `send` fails.",1075,124,7.516890525817871
