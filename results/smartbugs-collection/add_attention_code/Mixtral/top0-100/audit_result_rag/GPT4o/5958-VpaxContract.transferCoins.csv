The vulnerability lies in the usage of `delegatecall` on lines 31 and 38.

This creates a risk because `call()` does not revert the transaction if it fails; instead, it returns a boolean value indicating success or failure.

The vulnerability lies in the same line: `map[k] -= v;`.

",831,61,4.945266962051392

81,arithmetic,"YES, it is vulnerable because the same integer overflow vulnerability exists in the function `increaseLockTime(uint _secondsToIncrease)`.

2. **Line 25:** `balanceOf[msg.sender] += numTokens;`
   - This line can also cause an overflow if `balanceOf[msg.sender]` and `numTokens` add up to exceed `uint256` limits.

3. **Line 33:** `msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`
   - Similar to the `buy` function, this line can cause an overflow if `numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN` exceeds the maximum value for `uint256`.

In addition, the `transferCoins` function introduces an unchecked transfer, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities if it interacts with an external contract that may reenter and manipulate the contract state.",1133,224,16.068777322769165

The code is vulnerable due to the same reason as the previous one. In the `add` function, the line `sellerBalance += value;` can lead to an arithmetic overflow, as Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0 do not have built-in protections against overflows or underflows for unsigned integers.

94,bad randomness,"YES

The contract is vulnerable due to the use of block properties for randomness. Specifically, the line `bool won = (block.number % 2) == 0;` is vulnerable to manipulation by miners, who can influence the block number, making the outcome predictable.

This can lead to a denial of service (DOS) vulnerability by consuming excessive gas if the function is called with large input values for `numbers`. This type of vulnerability can prevent the contract from being executed due to the gas limits on the Ethereum network.

137,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability still lies in the `ifillArray` function, particularly in the loop at line 17 (`for(uint i=0;i<350;i++)`) and line 18 (`listAddresses.push(msg.sender)`). This loop can cause a **Denial of Service (DoS)** due to excessive gas consumption when the list grows large. Since Ethereum transactions have a gas limit, if the array becomes large enough, calling this function might exceed the gas limit, causing the function to fail and potentially making the contract unusable for future calls.",1003,118,8.335339784622192
138,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the same line as the previous code:

```solidity
require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));
```

This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack if the `send` function fails. When `send` fails, the entire transaction will revert, preventing new bids from being placed, effectively stopping the auction. This occurs because `send` only forwards a limited amount of gas, and if the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that consumes more gas or has a fallback function that reverts, it can block the process.",996,121,9.507090330123901
