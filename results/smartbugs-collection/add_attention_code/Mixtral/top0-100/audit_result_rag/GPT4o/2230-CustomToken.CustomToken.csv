```

This low-level call does not check the return value, which is a key risk factor. If the call fails, the contract will not revert or stop execution; instead, it will continue as if the operation succeeded. This can lead to situations where transfers may fail silently, resulting in unexpected outcomes and potential loss of funds.",1120,122,6.513169527053833
71,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The contract is vulnerable because the low-level function `_target.call.value(_value)();` is used without checking the return value.

The first contract (`FindThisHash`) still has the same front-running vulnerability as explained earlier. The `solve` function allows a user to submit a solution, but since the solution is revealed in a public transaction, a malicious user can copy it and submit the same solution with a higher gas fee, thereby stealing the reward.

The second contract (`CustomToken`) doesn't introduce any additional vulnerabilities related to front-running. However, the focus here is on the `FindThisHash` contract's vulnerability due to front-running, so the answer remains ""YES"" based on that.",1109,116,9.331800937652588

2. In the `sell()` function:
   - Line 33: `msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);` can also result in an overflow if `numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN` exceeds the maximum allowable value, leading to unexpected or incorrect behavior when transferring funds.

These arithmetic vulnerabilities can be exploited to manipulate token purchases and sales.",1230,178,12.78174352645874
83,arithmetic,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `count -= input` operation, which is susceptible to an arithmetic underflow in the same way as the previous contract.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` constructor initializes the `totalSupply` variable to a large number, but if further operations are performed on `totalSupply` or `balanceOf` without proper safeguards, it could also be prone to arithmetic vulnerabilities.",1246,122,11.395221948623657
87,arithmetic,"YES

The vulnerability in the second contract lies in the same issue as the first one, specifically the lack of safe arithmetic handling. Since Solidity 0.4.18 does not natively check for arithmetic overflows and underflows, operations like `balances[msg.sender] -= _value;` in the `transfer` function can lead to integer underflows. Additionally, the constructor of `CustomToken` initializes balances without safe arithmetic, potentially introducing vulnerabilities when handling very large or small values.",1143,98,6.718343257904053
88,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the same issue of integer overflow in the `run` function of the `IntegerOverflowAdd` contract.

The vulnerability lies in the `Lottery` contract, specifically in how randomness is handled. The line:

```solidity
bool won = (block.number % 2) == 0;

95,bad randomness,"YES. The vulnerability in the first contract lies in the use of predictable values for randomness. Specifically, `answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));` relies on the block hash and the current time (`now`) to generate a random number. Both the block hash and timestamp can be influenced or predicted by miners, making the random number generation insecure and subject to exploitation.

- Line 18: `uint256 y = salt * block.number / (salt % 5);` - Using `block.number` and combining it with `salt` still provides predictability to miners.
- Line 20: `uint256 seed = block.number / 3 + (salt % 300) + y;` - `block.number` and `salt` are still not secure sources for randomness.
- Line 22: `uint256 h = uint256(blockhash(seed));` - The block hash is only predictable for the last 256 blocks, and relying on it can be manipulated by miners, making it insecure for generating randomness.

It is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because in the `Collect` function, the contract allows external calls using `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` before the contract's state (i.e., `balances[msg.sender]`) is updated. This can allow an attacker to repeatedly call the `Collect` function and drain the contract's funds before the state is updated, leading to a reentrancy exploit.",1629,85,7.333927631378174
126,reentrancy,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. The `withdrawBalance` function in the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract allows for a reentrancy attack. Specifically, the call to `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""")` can be exploited by an attacker to repeatedly call the `withdrawBalance` function before the initial execution completes, allowing the attacker to drain the contract's funds.",1087,78,8.45269775390625
127,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the same line where `block.timestamp` is used in the `TimedCrowdsale` contract to determine whether the sale has finished. As explained before, the block timestamp can be manipulated by miners within a certain range, leading to potential exploitation.",995,55,10.35110592842102
128,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of `now` and `block.timestamp` for time-dependent logic and random number generation. Specifically:

1. **Line 13**: `if (rand > 0 && now - rand > 24 hours)` can be manipulated because miners have some control over the block timestamp, which introduces the risk of **timestamp manipulation**. This allows them to alter the conditions under which payouts are triggered.

2. **Line 27**: `return block.timestamp;` is used in the `randomGen()` function to generate a random number. Since `block.timestamp` is not a secure source of randomness, it can be influenced by miners, resulting in **bad randomness**.",1230,150,9.34564995765686
129,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is caused by the use of `block.timestamp` for time-based logic in the function `resetInvestment()` (line 21). The reliance on `block.timestamp` allows miners to manipulate the timestamp and potentially exploit the contract, especially in cases where the exact timing of events matters, as miners have the ability to adjust timestamps slightly to benefit themselves.

Additionally, the loop in the `attack()` function in the `Attacker` contract can cause a gas exhaustion issue by recursively calling itself up to 1023 times, increasing the risk of running out of gas.",1398,122,7.856647729873657
130,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because it still relies on `now` (or `block.timestamp`) for determining certain actions, specifically in the lines:

- `require(now != pastBlockTime); // only 1 transaction per block`
- `pastBlockTime = now;`
- `if(now % 15 == 0) { // payout if block.timestamp divisible by 15}`

This allows miners to manipulate the timestamp, which can lead to unfair outcomes, such as winning the contract's balance by adjusting the block time to meet the required conditions (like `now % 15 == 0`). This vulnerability is categorized under time manipulation.",1097,131,7.595452547073364
131,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `EtherLotto` contract, specifically in the line:

```solidity
var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;
```

This code uses `block.timestamp` for generating randomness, making it vulnerable to time manipulation. Miners can manipulate the timestamp, thereby affecting the outcome of the randomness, which can be exploited by malicious actors to predict or control the result of the game.",1207,89,7.86739444732666
132,short addresses,NO,1255,1,2.635699510574341
133,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `emptyCreditors` function. If the `creditorAddresses` array grows beyond 1500 entries, clearing the array with `creditorAddresses = new address ;` can consume an excessive amount of gas, leading to a denial of service (DoS) attack. This can make the function impossible to execute if the gas cost exceeds the block gas limit. Hence, this creates a potential for DoS by making the contract non-functional under high gas consumption scenarios.",1223,101,7.389179468154907
134,denial of service,"YES

It is vulnerable because of the potential for a **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack in the `insertNnumbers` function. Specifically, the loop dynamically increases the length of the `array` within the function, leading to a significant amount of gas being consumed, especially if `numbers` is large. This can result in the function running out of gas, causing a failure and making the contract unusable. Additionally, the `clearDOS` function, which resets the array, can also become expensive and prone to failure if the array size becomes very large.",1323,116,10.562098264694214
135,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability arises from the potential denial of service due to clearing the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays (lines 46 and 48) without proper handling of existing creditors. This can disrupt the payout mechanism, leading to a state where the contract may not function as intended, causing a denial of service for future transactions and payouts.",2297,73,6.133531808853149
136,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because of the same issue found in the `refundAll()` function. The line `require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));` can cause a denial of service if any of the `send` operations fail. This would stop the execution of the entire loop, preventing refunds to other addresses.",1206,72,5.749300003051758
137,denial of service,"**YES**, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in this contract lies in the `DosOneFunc` function, specifically in the `for` loop inside the `ifillArray` function. This loop (`for(uint i=0;i<350;i++)`) can potentially cause a **denial of service (DoS)** attack due to gas exhaustion. If the gas limit is reached during the execution of this function (due to the addition of addresses to the `listAddresses` array), the transaction will fail, and the function will become unusable. This could prevent users from interacting with the contract effectively, especially as the list grows larger, leading to a potential denial of service.",1100,139,7.924224376678467
138,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the same line as in the first contract: `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));`. This can potentially cause a **Denial of Service** (DoS) if the current frontrunner is a contract that has a fallback function which either reverts or consumes more gas than the block gas limit allows. In such cases, the `send` call would fail, preventing anyone else from successfully placing a higher bid and causing the auction to be effectively frozen.",1093,101,9.005879878997803
