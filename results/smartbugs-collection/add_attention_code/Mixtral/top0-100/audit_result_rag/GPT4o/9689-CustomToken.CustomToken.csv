The `MultiOwnable` contract has an access control vulnerability. Specifically, the `newOwner` function allows any address to be set as an owner by anyone, without proper authorization checks. This means any user can add themselves or another address as an owner, gaining unauthorized control over the contract.

Additionally, the `deleteOwner` function can be exploited since once an attacker adds themselves as an owner, they can subsequently remove legitimate owners, further compromising the contract's integrity. 

These access control issues make the contract vulnerable to unauthorized access and manipulation.",1349,111,11.79041838645935

The vulnerability lies in the `missing()` function of the `Missing` contract. The function is public and sets the contract owner to the caller's address.

This should instead check if the `amount` is less than or equal to the `balances[msg.sender]`, as the current condition allows withdrawal attempts even when the `msg.sender` does not have sufficient balance. This is an access control vulnerability as it improperly handles the validation of the withdrawal amount, potentially allowing users to withdraw more than their balance.

The `PopBonusCode` function reduces the length of the `bonusCodes` array without restricting who can call it. This creates an access control vulnerability, as anyone can reduce the array size, potentially causing the loss of stored data.

The vulnerability lies in the constructor function in both the `Missing` and `CustomToken` contracts. The function `Constructor` in `Missing` and `CustomToken` in `CustomToken` are written with uppercase names, but in Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, constructor functions must have the same name as the contract and should match exactly in case. Since `Constructor` and `CustomToken` do not match the contract names (`Missing` and `CustomToken`), these functions are considered regular public functions instead of constructors.

The vulnerability lies in the `increaseLockTime` function in the `TimeLock` contract. Specifically, the arithmetic operation `lockTime[msg.sender] += _secondsToIncrease` is susceptible to an **integer overflow**. Since Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0 do not automatically check for overflows, an attacker could pass a large value for `_secondsToIncrease`, causing `lockTime[msg.sender]` to overflow and potentially become a very small number or zero.

The vulnerability arises from potential integer overflows and underflows in the functions `overflowaddtostate`, `overflowmultostate`, `underflowtostate`, and their local versions (`overflowlocalonly`, `overflowmulocalonly`, `underflowlocalonly`). These vulnerabilities occur because the code does not have any safeguards to prevent arithmetic overflows or underflows on `count` or the local `res` variable, which can lead to unintended behavior such as the manipulation of balances or incorrect state updates.

Since the Solidity version used is 0.4.23, there is no built-in protection against these vulnerabilities (as later versions or using libraries like `SafeMath` provide). Therefore, large input values could cause `count` to overflow or underflow, compromising the contract's functionality and security.",1285,171,13.461448192596436
