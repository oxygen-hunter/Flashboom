This is a common vulnerability with low-level functions like `call`, `callcode`, `delegatecall`, and `send`.",1207,124,8.662105321884155
72,unchecked low level calls,"YES. 

The vulnerability in this smart contract is located in the `proxy` function of the `Proxy` contract, specifically in this line:
```solidity
target.call.value(msg.value)(data);
```
This is a low-level call using the `call` function, which does not automatically handle errors or reverts. If the `call` fails, the function will return `false`, but this return value is not checked in the code. As a result, any failure in the `call` will not stop execution, potentially allowing unintended consequences like loss of funds or other vulnerabilities to be exploited.",1377,122,8.243721961975098
73,front running,"YES. The contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks, particularly in the `claimReward` function. A malicious user can observe the transaction in the mempool, see the submitted solution, and submit a transaction with a higher gas fee to claim the reward before the legitimate user’s transaction is mined. Additionally, in the `setReward` function, the `owner.transfer(reward)` line could lead to vulnerabilities if the reward is transferred before the state is updated, allowing front-running of reward claims.",1202,99,7.12879753112793
74,front running,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the same function `solve` as before, which still uses `require(hash == sha3(solution));`. This creates an opportunity for a front-running attack where a malicious user can observe the pending transaction containing the correct solution and submit their own transaction with higher gas fees to claim the reward first.",1148,70,5.196825981140137
75,front running,"YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to front-running attacks. Specifically, the `approve` function, similar to the previous example, allows a malicious user to exploit a race condition by observing the approval of an allowance. An attacker can submit a higher gas fee transaction to front-run and potentially use the approved allowance before the original transaction is completed. This is a common vector for front-running vulnerabilities in ERC20 token implementations.",2222,85,7.287858724594116
76,front running,"YES. The `OddsAndEvens` contract is vulnerable to a front-running attack. This vulnerability arises because the `play` function (line 25) allows players to submit their chosen numbers publicly on the blockchain, which makes it possible for a malicious actor to see and preempt the second player’s transaction by submitting a higher gas fee. This could allow the malicious actor to influence the outcome of the game by choosing a number that ensures their win based on the first player’s choice.

Moreover, the vulnerability is exacerbated at line 28, where the `players[tot]` is assigned publicly. This setup gives an attacker ample opportunity to front-run and manipulate the outcome, making it vulnerable to front-running attacks.",1421,145,10.278003931045532

This can cause the `count` variable to wrap around, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or exploitation.",971,61,6.658822536468506
79,arithmetic,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable because it inherits the vulnerable `Overflow_Add` contract. The vulnerability exists in the `add()` function of `Overflow_Add` due to the potential for an arithmetic overflow when adding to `balance` without proper validation. In Solidity 0.4.25, there is no built-in protection for overflows or underflows, so the `balance += deposit` operation can cause an overflow if a sufficiently large `deposit` is provided.",967,94,8.191206693649292
80,arithmetic,"YES, the vulnerability lies in the `IntegerOverflowMinimal` contract, specifically in line 17: `count -= input;`.

1. **Line 23 (require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);)**: If `numTokens` is a large enough value, multiplying it by `PRICE_PER_TOKEN` can result in an integer overflow in versions of Solidity prior to 0.8, which do not have automatic overflow checks.

2. **Line 25 (balanceOf[msg.sender] += numTokens;)**: Similar to the buy function, an integer overflow can occur if a large enough `numTokens` is passed, causing `balanceOf[msg.sender]` to overflow.

- **Line 24:** `count *= input;` - This is vulnerable to an overflow if the result of multiplication exceeds the maximum value of `uint`.
- **Line 30:** `count -= input;` - This is vulnerable to an underflow if `input` is greater than `count`, leading to a negative value which wraps around in `uint`.

These vulnerabilities can lead to serious issues such as unexpected behavior or exploitation by attackers.",1285,151,7.060484409332275

```solidity
require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
```

Since Solidity's unsigned integers cannot be negative, subtracting a value larger than `balances[msg.sender]` would cause an underflow, bypassing the `require` check and resulting in an incorrect balance update. This underflow could lead to unauthorized fund transfers or other unintended behavior.",1182,115,9.645937204360962
88,arithmetic,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `IntegerOverflowAdd` contract, specifically in the `run` function. The `count += input;` operation is vulnerable to an integer overflow, as Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0 do not automatically handle overflow checks for unsigned integers (`uint`).

90,arithmetic,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the line `balanceOf[_to] += _value;`. This operation can cause an integer overflow if the recipient's balance (`balanceOf[_to]`) and the transferred value (`_value`) together exceed the maximum value that a `uint256` can hold.

91,bad randomness,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability arises in the `PredictTheBlockHashChallenge` contract, particularly due to its reliance on the `blockhash()` function to generate randomness.

The contract is vulnerable because it uses weak sources of randomness that are predictable, such as `block.coinbase`, `msg.sender`, and `block.difficulty`. These can be manipulated or predicted by miners or attackers, making it susceptible to exploitation.

93,bad randomness,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the use of the `rand` function, which relies on predictable blockchain attributes such as the block hash and block number to generate randomness. Specifically, the line `uint256 hashVal = uint256(block.blockhash(lastBlockNumber));` is problematic because block hashes can be influenced or predicted by miners, making the randomness predictable and susceptible to manipulation. This can allow malicious actors to exploit the smart contract by predicting the random values and gaming the system.",2975,95,6.417543649673462

95,bad randomness,"YES. The vulnerability in the provided smart contract code lies in the same issue with randomness as previously explained.

The `GuessTheRandomNumberChallenge` contract generates the `answer` using the following line:

```solidity
answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));
```

This approach to randomness is vulnerable because:
1. **Blockhash predictability**: The block hash of the previous block (`block.blockhash(block.number - 1)`) can be known by miners.
2. **Timestamp manipulation**: The `now` (which is an alias for `block.timestamp`) can be influenced by miners within a small range.

These two sources are not truly random and can be exploited by malicious actors who can predict or manipulate these values, making it possible to guess the `answer` with a high probability, breaking the security of the game. Therefore, this contract is vulnerable due to the predictable randomness mechanism.",1169,193,10.604880094528198
96,bad randomness,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The randomness generation in the `RandomNumberGenerator` contract is flawed, as it relies on predictable sources such as `block.timestamp`, `block.number`, and `blockhash(seed)`, which can be influenced or predicted by miners. Specifically:

- Line 12: `uint256 private salt =  block.timestamp;` is predictable and subject to miner manipulation.
- Line 18: `uint256 y = salt * block.number / (salt % 5);` combines predictable values, further reducing randomness.
- Line 20: `uint256 seed = block.number / 3 + (salt % 300) + y;` can be predicted, as block numbers are deterministic.
- Line 22: `uint256 h = uint256(blockhash(seed));` uses `blockhash` of a past block, which is publicly available and predictable after the block is mined.

129,time manipulation,"YES, the contract is vulnerable because it relies on `block.timestamp` in the `resetInvestment` function (line 23). This allows for potential time manipulation by miners, as they can influence the `block.timestamp` within a certain range, which could be exploited to manipulate the timing of when the `resetInvestment` function can be called.",1437,69,6.05198073387146
130,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `Roulette` contract, specifically in the lines:

```solidity
require(now != pastBlockTime);  
pastBlockTime = now;
```

This allows for time manipulation because the `now` variable (alias for `block.timestamp`) can be influenced by miners. They can manipulate the block timestamp within a certain range, potentially allowing an attacker to win the game by ensuring `now % 15 == 0` and draining the contract's balance. This makes the contract susceptible to timestamp manipulation attacks.",1136,109,8.507150173187256
131,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` in the `EtherLotto` contract for generating randomness. This allows miners to manipulate the block's timestamp and potentially control the outcome of the random value, which makes the contract vulnerable to exploitation.",1246,52,5.471578121185303
132,short addresses,NO,1294,1,3.581042528152466
133,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in this case arises from the potential denial of service (DoS) issue due to the unbounded loop in the `addCreditors()` function and the logic in the `emptyCreditors()` function.

- **`addCreditors()` vulnerability**: This function allows adding 350 creditors in one transaction. As the creditor list grows, the execution cost of certain functions increases, particularly when trying to execute the `emptyCreditors()` function.
  
- **`emptyCreditors()` vulnerability**: Once the `creditorAddresses.length` exceeds 1500, the contract attempts to clear the entire creditor list (`creditorAddresses = new address `). If the list becomes too large, it may exceed the gas limit, leading to a failure in resetting the creditor list, which could result in a denial of service. This would prevent the contract from properly resetting its state and would make it unusable.",1262,191,10.788430213928223
134,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, particularly due to potential gas limit exhaustion. The loop dynamically extends the array size without any fixed upper bound (lines 18-22). If a large number is passed to `numbers`, it could result in excessive gas consumption, leading to a denial of service (DOS). This vulnerability can be exploited to consume all available gas, preventing other functions from executing or new transactions from being processed effectively.",1362,92,6.691233158111572
135,denial of service,NO,2336,1,3.076641321182251
136,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability exists in the `refundAll` function of the `Refunder` contract. Specifically, using `send()` can fail if the receiving address is a contract that refuses to accept ether or runs out of gas, causing the entire loop to revert. This can result in a denial of service, as one failing `send()` call would prevent the rest of the refunds from being processed.",1245,80,6.600805997848511
137,denial of service,NO,1139,1,2.5970842838287354
138,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the same part of the `DosAuction` contract: `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));`. If the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that has a fallback function designed to consume a large amount of gas or intentionally revert, it can block the auction by preventing refunds, which results in a denial of service for future bids.",1132,82,5.670473337173462
