18,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability exists in the **retrieve** function. Specifically:

- The condition `if (msg.value >= (this.balance - msg.value))` is problematic because it allows an attacker to bypass the intended logic and retrieve the contract's entire balance by sending an appropriate `msg.value`. This can be exploited to drain funds from the contract.

91,bad randomness,"YES

The contract is vulnerable due to the use of predictable randomness. Specifically, the line `bytes32 answer = blockhash(guesses[msg.sender].block);` in the `settle` function relies on the `blockhash` function, which can be influenced by miners and is predictable to some extent.

94,bad randomness,"YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable for the following reasons:

1. **Predictable Randomness**:
   - The line `bool won = (block.number % 2) == 0;` is vulnerable because it relies on the block number to determine the outcome. Block numbers are publicly known and can be manipulated to a certain extent by miners, allowing them to exploit the predictability of the ""randomness.""

2. **Unchecked Code Hash Comparison**:
   - In the `retrieve()` function, the line `if (bytes5(keccak256(code)) == 0x70014a63ef)` relies on comparing a hash to determine whether to transfer the contract balance to the caller. This hash is hardcoded and could potentially be reverse-engineered, leading to a vulnerability where an attacker could discover the correct code and drain the contract balance.

3. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**:
   - The function `makeBet()` contains the line `if(!msg.sender.send(msg.value)) { throw; }`. Using `send` to transfer Ether can be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks if the recipient is a contract that calls back into the original function before the state changes.",1285,243,13.113096475601196
95,bad randomness,"YES. The contract is vulnerable because it uses predictable randomness in the constructor on line 21:

As with the previous contract, this randomness relies on the block hash and timestamp, both of which can be manipulated or predicted by a malicious miner. This allows attackers to predict the random number and exploit the contract. Additionally, in the `retrieve` function, the check for `bytes5(keccak256(code)) == 0x70014a63ef` also relies on a simple hash, which can be brute-forced.",1049,131,7.932665586471558

The vulnerability lies in the same issues identified before, related to randomness:

1. **Line 12**: `uint256 private salt = block.timestamp;` - Block timestamps are predictable and can be influenced by miners.
2. **Line 18**: `uint256 y = salt * block.number / (salt % 5);` - This calculation uses predictable values such as block number and salt.
3. **Line 20**: `uint256 seed = block.number / 3 + (salt % 300) + y;` - Again, this relies on predictable inputs, making the randomness weak.
4. **Line 22**: `uint256 h = uint256(blockhash(seed));` - Blockhash can only be used for recent blocks and is not a reliable source of randomness.

The vulnerability exists in the same manner as in the original code, particularly in the use of `now` (or `block.timestamp`) for time manipulation, which can be influenced by miners. Additionally, `block.timestamp` is still used to generate random numbers, which leads to bad randomness.",1149,60,13.970844507217407
129,time manipulation,"YES. The contract is vulnerable due to reliance on `block.timestamp` in line 27, which allows for potential manipulation by miners.",1317,27,4.873037099838257
130,time manipulation,"**YES**  
The contract is vulnerable due to time manipulation. The vulnerability is in the same lines as the previous contract:

1. **Line 20**: `require(now != pastBlockTime);`  
   - This relies on `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`), which can be manipulated by miners, allowing them to control when the contract logic triggers.

2. **Line 22**: `pastBlockTime = now;`  
   - Storing `now` makes the contract dependent on the timestamp for future executions, which could be exploited by miners to influence when the transfer of balance happens.",1016,126,7.1852052211761475
131,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` for generating randomness on line 43 in the `play` function. The value of `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners, allowing them to influence the outcome of the random number generation. This makes the contract susceptible to exploitation through time manipulation attacks.",1126,70,10.145928621292114
132,short addresses,"YES, it is vulnerable because the `sendCoin` function in this contract is susceptible to a short address attack, similar to the previous one. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the way addresses are handled, where attackers can exploit the EVM's tolerance for incorrectly padded arguments. This can cause improperly encoded arguments to be sent, leading to vulnerabilities in how the contract interprets addresses.",1174,76,5.909315347671509
133,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is primarily in the `retrieve` function. The check `if (msg.value >= (this.balance - msg.value))` seems to be trying to ensure that the sender is contributing more than the current balance, but the logic might allow certain edge cases to bypass this, depending on the balance at the time. Additionally, the contract calls `msg.sender.transfer(this.balance)` which can result in a denial of service if the recipient is a contract with a fallback function that consumes too much gas, causing the transaction to fail. 

This can lead to a situation where the `retrieve` function can't complete, locking up the contract's funds.",1142,137,11.089630603790283
134,denial of service,"YES

The contract is vulnerable to a **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack due to the `insertNnumbers` function. The vulnerability comes from the dynamic resizing of the `array` inside a loop, which can cause excessive gas consumption, leading to a potential DoS. Specifically:

- In lines 19-20: `if(numElements == array.length) { array.length += 1; }`
  
Resizing arrays in Solidity is costly in terms of gas, and this loop could result in the function running out of gas, especially if the `numbers` argument is large, thus causing the function to fail.

Additionally, the `retrieve` function, which checks the contract balance and conditionally transfers all funds, can also be a target for attacks manipulating the gas limit or using fallback functions.",1242,164,14.932289600372314
135,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the same logic as the first contract. Specifically, the lines:

```solidity
creditorAddresses = new address ;
creditorAmounts = new uint ;
```

These lines reset the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays, which can lead to a denial of service (DoS) if the contract's balance becomes insufficient to pay the creditors. By resetting these arrays prematurely, the contract could be unable to complete its intended functionality, such as making proper payments to creditors, thus leading to a potential denial of service.",2216,118,11.135423183441162
136,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the same `refundAll` function, where a failure in the `send` call for one of the addresses can cause the entire function to revert. This creates a potential denial of service (DoS) attack, as any single failure in sending refunds can block all other users from receiving their funds.",1125,72,6.459520101547241
137,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability stems from the `retrieve` function. Specifically, in the following line:

```solidity
if (msg.value >= (this.balance - msg.value)) {
```

This line can potentially cause issues, as it depends on the contract's balance before receiving the current transaction. If the balance changes due to other transactions or malicious manipulation, this check could become invalid, leading to denial of service (DoS). Additionally, the condition is problematic when the balance approaches zero, causing the logic to fail and preventing legitimate transfers.

Thus, the contract is susceptible to a denial of service attack due to this flawed balance check.",1019,133,14.110832214355469
138,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability is still present in the same line: `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));`. This can lead to a denial of service if the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that either consumes more gas than available or deliberately reverts the transfer, preventing the contract from functioning correctly and blocking future bids.",1012,73,6.197683334350586
