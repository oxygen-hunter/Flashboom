11,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `cyberEntry2` contract. Specifically, the constructor calls `gk.enter` with parameters that are derived using `keccak256` hashing of the passphrase and the contract's address (`me`). This can be exploited if an attacker can control the input parameters or predict the passcode generation, allowing unauthorized access to the `Gatekeeper` contract's functionality. Additionally, access control mechanisms in the `MultiOwnable` contract are weak, as any owner can assign new owners without proper verification, leading to potential privilege escalation or loss of control.",1305,118,7.3089282512664795
12,access control,"YES. The vulnerability in the provided smart contract is due to an access control issue in the `missing()` function. The function allows **anyone** to become the owner of the contract because it sets the `owner` to `msg.sender` without any restrictions. Therefore, an attacker can call this function and take ownership of the contract, allowing them to drain the funds through the `withdraw()` function.",1043,81,6.269312858581543
13,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the constructor of the `Rubixi` contract. The constructor is named `DynamicPyramid()`, which is incorrect since Solidity versions before 0.5.0 require the constructor to have the same name as the contract itself, i.e., `Rubixi()`. This means that `DynamicPyramid()` is treated as a regular function and can be called by anyone after deployment, allowing them to reset the `creator` address to any arbitrary address, bypassing access control protections.",2963,103,6.959291696548462
14,access control,"YES. The vulnerability exists in the `withdraw` function, specifically in the condition `require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);`. This check is incorrect because it allows users to withdraw funds even when they don't have enough balance, leading to a potential access control issue. The condition should be `require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);` to prevent users from withdrawing more than their balance.",1160,75,5.853718996047974
15,access control,"YES, the second smart contract (`cyberEntry2`) is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of the constructor function:

1. **Unprotected constructor**: The constructor `cyberEntry2` is public, which allows anyone to deploy the contract and call it with arbitrary inputs. This exposes the contract to potential abuse since there are no access controls on who can initialize the contract and interact with the Gatekeeper contract.

2. **Potential reentrancy and misuse**: If the Gatekeeper contract is poorly implemented, attackers could exploit the `enter` function, especially when the passphrase and key are passed directly from the constructor without proper validation. This could lead to unauthorized access.

3. **Assembly code issues**: The use of inline assembly to get the contract’s address could introduce potential risks, especially if not handled securely.

Thus, this contract has multiple areas that expose it to potential access control issues and vulnerabilities related to how the Gatekeeper interaction is handled.",1053,196,9.231192350387573
16,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper access control in the `cyberEntry2` contract. Specifically, anyone can call the constructor `cyberEntry2(address _gkAddress, bytes32 passphrase)` to try and enter the `Gatekeeper` contract by generating the `key` from a `passphrase`. The contract does not restrict who can call the `enter` function in the `Gatekeeper` contract. This can lead to unauthorized access, violating the intended access control mechanisms.",1118,102,6.715661287307739
17,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the use of `delegatecall` in the `Proxy` contract without proper access control. The `forward` function allows any user to invoke `delegatecall` with arbitrary data on a target contract, which can be exploited to execute malicious code in the context of the `Proxy` contract's storage. Additionally, the `cyberEntry2` contract does not implement any robust access control, leaving it open to exploitation. Therefore, it is vulnerable due to the lack of sufficient checks on who can invoke critical functions like `delegatecall`.",1021,113,7.431246519088745
18,access control,"YES, the vulnerability in the smart contract exists due to the following reasons:

1. **Access Control Vulnerability**: The `PushBonusCode`, `PopBonusCode`, and `UpdateBonusCodeAt` functions are all public, which means anyone can call these functions, including unauthorized users. There are no access control mechanisms that restrict these functions to the contract owner or authorized users. This allows anyone to modify or delete the `bonusCodes` array.

2. **Improper Require Condition in `PopBonusCode`**: The condition `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length)` is unnecessary since array lengths are always non-negative. However, reducing the array length with `bonusCodes.length--` can be problematic because it allows anyone to shrink the array arbitrarily, leading to potential misuse or manipulation of the data. 

These issues expose the contract to unauthorized manipulation of sensitive data.",1214,177,8.265123844146729
19,access control,"YES. The first smart contract ""Missing"" is vulnerable because the constructor function is incorrectly named as `Constructor` instead of `constructor` (note the capitalization). This means it will not be recognized as a constructor by Solidity, and as a result, the `owner` variable will not be initialized, leaving the contract vulnerable to unauthorized access.

In the second contract, ""cyberEntry2,"" it allows the use of an unchecked assembly block to derive a `key`, which might expose vulnerabilities related to access control and weak security practices. This could allow attackers to manipulate the key generation process or exploit unchecked assumptions in how the passphrase and key are computed and used in conjunction with the `Gatekeeper` contract.",1043,142,11.086496591567993
20,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `initWallet()` function in the `Wallet` contract. It allows anyone to call the function and set themselves as the `creator`. This is an **access control issue**, as the `creator` role should be restricted to the contract's deployer or a specific authorized entity. Without this control, any malicious actor could take over the contract and gain unauthorized access to critical functions like `migrateTo()`, which transfers the contract's entire balance to another address.",1178,100,8.076464176177979
21,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable because it uses `tx.origin` for access control in the `MyContract` code. This can be exploited by attackers using intermediate contracts to bypass the security check, allowing unauthorized access to the `sendTo` function. Additionally, the `cyberEntry2` contract uses inline assembly and unchecked operations, which could introduce vulnerabilities such as bypassing intended access controls or manipulating the contract's behavior.",1010,84,6.073191165924072
22,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable due to **access control issues**.

In the `Wallet` contract, specifically in the `refund()` function, there is no check to ensure that only the creator or authorized users can call this function. This allows **any caller** to execute the `refund()` function and transfer their entire balance to their own address. This is an access control vulnerability because the function should be restricted to authorized users or should follow proper access control mechanisms to avoid abuse.

Additionally, in the `cyberEntry2` contract, there's a vulnerability because the constructor is improperly named (`cyberEntry2()` instead of `constructor()` in Solidity 0.4.24), making it a **public function** that anyone can call, allowing unauthorized users to execute the logic meant for the constructor. This creates another access control issue, as it allows unrestricted access to critical logic that was intended to be called only once during deployment.

Both contracts have access control vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.",1198,199,10.763177871704102
23,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. 

The `SimpleSuicide` contract has an access control vulnerability in the `sudicideAnyone()` function because it allows any caller to trigger the `selfdestruct` function, sending the contract’s balance to the caller (`msg.sender`). There is no restriction or validation on who can call this function, leading to an access control flaw. Any malicious user can call this function and destroy the contract, potentially causing a loss of funds or disrupting contract functionality.",969,100,9.582521200180054
24,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `changeOwner` function of the `Unprotected` contract. This function does not include the `onlyowner` modifier, meaning anyone can call it and change the contract's owner. This lack of access control makes it vulnerable to unauthorized ownership changes.",1050,57,4.544996738433838
25,access control,"YES. 

The vulnerability in the `Phishable` contract stems from the use of `tx.origin` for access control. An attacker can exploit this by tricking the owner into sending a transaction through a malicious contract, causing the check `require(tx.origin == owner)` to pass even when the attacker initiated the transaction indirectly. This bypasses the intended access control.

In the `cyberEntry2` contract, there is an additional potential vulnerability due to the complex use of `assembly`, which could introduce unsafe or unexpected behavior depending on how the `Gatekeeper` contract is implemented. However, the specific vulnerability related to the access control lies primarily in the `Phishable` contract.",1028,137,7.9870078563690186

The `Delta` contract is vulnerable because:

1. **Unchecked Low-Level Calls**: The use of `send` in lines 54 (`owner2.send(sum2)`) and 65 (`owner.send(balance)`) is risky. If the `send` operation fails, it does not revert the transaction, which could leave the contract in an inconsistent state. The return value of `send` is not being checked for success, and failure will not halt the execution.

2. **Potential Loss of Funds**: If `send` fails due to gas issues or other reasons, the funds may not reach the intended recipient, leading to loss of funds without the transaction reverting.

Low-level calls like `call` and `send` should always have their return values checked and proper error handling should be implemented.",1756,164,9.64067006111145
29,unchecked low level calls,"YES. It is vulnerable because the low-level `call` function on line 39 (`adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);`) does not check the return value.

This can lead to an unchecked error, which may cause the transaction to behave unpredictably without any rollback or notification of failure.

Additionally, in the `cyberEntry2` contract, there is also a potential issue with how the `gk.enter()` function is called. If the call to `gk.enter(passphrase, key)` fails, the failure will not be handled, leading to a similar vulnerability where the transaction does not revert upon failure.

token.call(bytes4(sha3(""transfer(address,uint256)"")),to,amount);
```
This call does not check for a return value to confirm whether the function succeeded, leading to potential issues if the `call` fails.

Similarly, in the `TokenBank` contract, line 61 contains the code:
```
_addr.call.value(_wei);
```
Again, this call does not check for a return value, leaving the contract vulnerable to failures if the call does not complete successfully.

Unchecked low-level calls like these can result in security issues such as fail-open scenarios, where the contract continues execution even when the external call fails, leading to potential vulnerabilities.",1760,176,12.661551475524902
67,unchecked low level calls,"YES

It is vulnerable because in the `cyberEntry2` contract, the `enter` function of the `Gatekeeper` contract is called without any checks on the return value. This can be dangerous because, if the `enter` function fails, it will not stop the execution of the contract, leading to potential security issues, similar to the vulnerability seen in low-level `call()` functions not checking return values.",1421,85,9.165305376052856
68,unchecked low level calls,"YES. The `withdraw` function in the `keepMyEther` contract uses `msg.sender.call.value(balances[msg.sender])()` without checking the return value. This is a common vulnerability in Solidity contracts when low-level calls like `call()` are used without checking for success, which could lead to unintended behaviors such as reentrancy attacks or failed ether transfers.",1062,74,6.541672706604004
69,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the vulnerability lies in the `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);` line within the `Command` function. This low-level call does not check the return value of `adr.call`, meaning if the call fails, the transaction will not revert. This can lead to fail-open behavior, allowing potential malicious contracts or unexpected behavior when the call fails silently.",1185,73,5.262026786804199
70,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `caddress.call` in the `EBU` contract, where the return value of the low-level `call()` function is not checked. As explained in your notes, low-level calls like `call()` return a boolean indicating success or failure. If this return value is not checked, it can lead to failures that go unnoticed, allowing critical functions like transferring tokens to silently fail, leading to potential issues such as loss of funds.

The second vulnerability could lie in the `cyberEntry2` contract, where the passphrase is combined with the address in the `keccak256` hash. This part of the code might be vulnerable to potential replay attacks or incorrect assumptions about the security of the hash function in combination with assembly.",1115,162,10.848075866699219
71,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the **unchecked low-level call** in the `SimpleWallet` contract, specifically in the `sendMoney` function:

```solidity
_target.call.value(_value)();
```

Low-level calls like `call()` return a boolean value indicating success or failure. In this case, the return value of the `call()` function is not checked. This can lead to fail-open scenarios, where the transaction may continue executing even if the call fails. This could result in the contract losing funds or behaving unexpectedly.

",1163,113,7.389590501785278
72,unchecked low level calls,"YES. 

The contract is vulnerable because it uses low-level `call()` (line 14 in the `Proxy` contract) without checking the return value. As mentioned, low-level calls like `call()` can fail silently and return a boolean indicating success or failure. If this return value is not checked, it may result in the contract proceeding with logic as if the call succeeded, even when it failed. This can lead to unintended outcomes or security vulnerabilities, such as funds being lost or locked up.",1333,101,7.533760070800781
73,front running,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The first contract, `EthTxOrderDependenceMinimal`, is vulnerable to front-running attacks due to the visibility of transaction data on the blockchain and the ordering of transactions based on gas fees. A malicious actor could observe a transaction that claims the reward and submit their own transaction with a higher gas fee to claim the reward before the original transaction is processed.

In the second contract, `cyberEntry2`, there is a vulnerability due to the use of `keccak256` with predictable input values (the passphrase and contract address) to generate the gate key. A malicious actor could compute this key off-chain and attempt to front-run the contract’s interaction with the `Gatekeeper` contract, exploiting the predictable behavior of key generation.",1158,155,8.840121030807495
74,front running,NO,1104,1,2.72025728225708
75,front running,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability arises in the **cyberEntry2** contract's constructor:
- The use of `assembly` to retrieve the contract's address (`me := address`) is unsafe because the `address` opcode is being used incorrectly, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
- The way the key is generated using `keccak256(passphrase, me)` can be front-run by attackers. Since the hash generation is deterministic and public, malicious actors can observe the passphrase in pending transactions, compute the key, and submit their own transaction with higher gas fees to preempt the original one, resulting in a front-running attack.

This matches the vulnerability type of **front-running** you mentioned.",2178,143,8.1298828125
76,front running,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is caused by the potential for front-running attacks in the `play` function, as explained in the initial explanation. Specifically, since the players' numbers are submitted publicly in the transaction, a malicious actor could monitor the blockchain, see the number submitted by the first player, and submit a transaction with a higher gas fee to gain priority in the next block. This allows the malicious player to manipulate the outcome of the game by choosing a number that ensures they win the game based on the sum of both numbers being even or odd. 

Thus, the smart contract is vulnerable to front-running.",1377,125,12.163626909255981
77,arithmetic,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the arithmetic operation in the `cyberEntry2` contract when calculating the `key`. The expression `uint64(keccak256(passphrase, me)) ^ uint64(0) - 1` can lead to an underflow due to the subtraction of 1 from a potentially small value (when `uint64(keccak256(...))` is zero or close to zero). This is an arithmetic underflow vulnerability in Solidity versions prior to 0.8.x, where integer underflows and overflows were not automatically checked.

This can cause unintended behavior, making it vulnerable to exploitation.",947,127,7.271613121032715
78,arithmetic,"YES, the initial smart contract code you provided (`IntegerOverflowMul`) is vulnerable to an arithmetic overflow. The vulnerability lies in the `run` function where `count *= input;` can result in an integer overflow if `input` is large enough, causing the multiplication to wrap around and produce an incorrect, potentially exploitable result. 

However, looking at the second piece of code provided for evaluation which also includes the `cyberEntry2` contract, the vulnerability in question (arithmetic overflow related to multiplication) is not directly present in its logic. This contract deals with generating a key and interacting with a separate `Gatekeeper` contract, which are unrelated to overflow in arithmetic operations within `IntegerOverflowMul`. Therefore, although the initial code (`IntegerOverflowMul`) had a vulnerability, the second contract provided for evaluation does not have the same risk without additional context about the `Gatekeeper` implementation or overflow operations.",934,185,9.319993257522583

The vulnerability arises due to an arithmetic underflow in the line:
```solidity

The vulnerability in the first part of the code is an arithmetic underflow in the `count -= input;` operation, as `count` is initialized to 1. If the input is larger than 1, this would cause an underflow, making `count` wrap around and become a large number, which is a common vulnerability in Solidity versions before 0.8.0. 

In the second part of the code, the `cyberEntry2` contract contains another vulnerability related to the use of `assembly` for generating a key. Using `keccak256` combined with assembly logic and passing a key derived from that can result in predictable or exploitable behavior, especially since there's no strong validation mechanism or randomness in generating the key. This can be leveraged by an attacker to bypass certain checks or restrictions within the contract.",997,176,11.654765844345093
86,arithmetic,"YES. The vulnerabilities in the smart contract are due to the potential for arithmetic overflow and underflow in the operations involving `count`. These vulnerabilities exist because Solidity versions prior to 0.8.x do not automatically check for overflows and underflows in arithmetic operations.

- Line 24: `count *= input;` could result in an overflow if `input` is large enough.
- Line 30: `count -= input;` could result in an underflow if `input` is larger than `count`.

Additionally, even though the local variables in the other functions (`overflowlocalonly`, `overflowmulocalonly`, `underflowlocalonly`) do not modify the state, they also have potential for overflows and underflows in arithmetic operations, which could lead to unexpected behavior.",1241,186,13.722485065460205

This results in an incorrect balance for `msg.sender` and can be exploited by malicious actors.",1138,77,6.309154272079468
88,arithmetic,"YES. The vulnerability in the first contract arises from the potential for an arithmetic overflow in the `count += input;` operation. If the `input` value is large enough, adding it to `count` could cause the result to overflow, leading to incorrect behavior or potential exploitation.

In the second contract, `cyberEntry2`, there is a vulnerability in the way the `key` is generated using `keccak256` and the `assembly` block. The use of raw assembly and deterministic methods to generate the `key` makes it susceptible to being reverse-engineered, allowing an attacker to potentially derive the correct `key` and bypass access controls in the `Gatekeeper` contract. Thus, this contract is vulnerable as well.",927,149,7.258275270462036

The `cyberEntry2` contract contains a vulnerability in the generation of the `key` using `keccak256(passphrase, me)`. This method of generating a key is susceptible to being predicted or reverse-engineered because `passphrase` and the contract address (`me`) are not inherently secret or random. Attackers can manipulate or compute the result, making it possible to bypass the intended security of the `Gatekeeper` contract.

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
{
    balances[msg.sender]-=_am;
    TransferLog.AddMessage(msg.sender,_am,""CashOut"");
}
```

Here, the contract sends Ether to the caller using the low-level `call` function without updating the balance first. An attacker can exploit this by repeatedly calling the `CashOut` function before the contract updates the balance, draining the contract's funds.",1484,119,4.860664367675781
123,reentrancy,"YES. The contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack due to the line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This is a low-level call that allows external contracts to re-enter the calling contract before the initial execution is complete, which can result in the contract state being altered in unintended ways (e.g., by draining funds). This behavior allows a reentrant contract to repeatedly call the vulnerable function and exploit the system before the balance update occurs.",1580,98,7.4848551750183105
124,reentrancy,"YES. The contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `CashOut` function where it uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` to send ether to the caller without updating the contract's state (i.e., the balance deduction) first. This allows an attacker to re-enter the contract and drain more funds before the balance is updated.",1470,76,6.547516107559204
125,reentrancy,"YES

The smart contract `BANK_SAFE` is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the function `Collect()` on line 54:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

Here, the contract sends ether to `msg.sender` before updating the balance. This allows a malicious contract to call `Collect()` repeatedly before the balance is updated, leading to a reentrancy attack and potentially draining the funds.",1624,93,5.814324378967285
126,reentrancy,"YES. The `Reentrancy_insecure` contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. This vulnerability occurs in the `withdrawBalance` function, where the call to `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""")` transfers funds before updating the state variable `userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;`. An attacker could exploit this by reentering the contract and repeatedly calling `withdrawBalance` before the balance is reset, draining the contract of its funds.",1082,95,7.828654527664185
127,time manipulation,"YES

The vulnerability in the provided code lies in the `block.timestamp` usage within the `TimedCrowdsale` contract, as previously explained, which can be manipulated by miners. Additionally, the `cyberEntry2` contract has a potential vulnerability in the way the `key` is generated using the `keccak256` function and the address derived from the contract's `assembly` block. This complex key calculation based on predictable values like the contract's address can potentially expose it to brute-force attacks or manipulation if the passphrase is weak or predictable.",990,113,10.496866703033447
128,time manipulation,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability comes from using `block.timestamp` (or `now` in older Solidity versions) in lines 13 and 27. This allows miners to manipulate the time to their advantage, which could lead to exploiting the logic of time-sensitive conditions, such as payout decisions.",1225,62,9.46488094329834
129,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability arises from **block.timestamp** being used in the `invest` and `resetInvestment` functions. This value can be manipulated by miners, who have a degree of control over the exact timestamp included in a block. This allows a malicious miner to alter the timing of investments and the reset of the jackpot, potentially exploiting the contract’s time-dependent logic.",1393,80,7.421597003936768
130,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the reliance on `now` (which is an alias for `block.timestamp`) in the `Roulette` contract, specifically in the line `require(now != pastBlockTime);` and `pastBlockTime = now;`. As previously mentioned, miners can manipulate the block timestamp within a small range, leading to potential exploitation by manipulating the contract's behavior, especially for conditions like `if(now % 15 == 0)` which can be exploited for financial gain.",1092,104,7.123619318008423
131,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` for randomness generation in the `EtherLotto` contract. The line:

```solidity
var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;
```

uses `block.timestamp` as a source of randomness, making it susceptible to manipulation by miners. This can allow the miner to influence the outcome of the `play` function, as they can choose a timestamp that favors a particular outcome (e.g., winning or losing), resulting in insecure randomness.",1202,107,6.271233081817627
132,short addresses,"YES

The given smart contract `MyToken` is vulnerable to a short address attack. This type of vulnerability arises from the way Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) handles function arguments, which can be exploited if the address parameter (`to`) in the `sendCoin` function is not properly validated. Specifically, if the address is not of the correct length, it can cause the following arguments to be incorrectly encoded, leading to potential loss of funds. This vulnerability lies in the `sendCoin` function on line 18, where the `address to` parameter is not validated for correct length.

Additionally, the second contract `cyberEntry2` contains a vulnerability in the way it handles the `key` calculation and the interaction with the `Gatekeeper` contract. The use of assembly to get the contract address and the keccak256 hash calculation to derive `key` can be exploited if an attacker is able to influence the input parameters to produce a specific `key` that bypasses the gatekeeper's checks. This makes it susceptible to targeted attacks.",1250,212,14.52517580986023
133,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in the **DosGas** contract comes from the `emptyCreditors` function. Specifically, when the `creditorAddresses.length > 1500`, the code attempts to set `creditorAddresses = new address ;`. This operation can consume a large amount of gas if the array is large, potentially causing the transaction to exceed the gas limit and fail. This would prevent the contract from resetting the array, leading to a **denial of service**.

In the **cyberEntry2** contract, the vulnerability lies in how the **Gatekeeper** contract is interacted with. The `gk.enter` function may have constraints (e.g., gas limit checks, or key verification checks) that can lead to a denial of service if the passphrase or gas consumption conditions are not properly handled.",1218,171,8.606877565383911
134,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability stems from the `insertNnumbers` function, particularly in the loop that grows the `array` dynamically. Specifically:

- **Lines 18-22** involve increasing the `array.length` and adding elements, which can result in **Denial of Service (DoS)**. If `numbers` is large, the for-loop will consume a significant amount of gas, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. This could prevent the function from completing and making the contract unusable for other users.

This scenario is a form of **gas exhaustion DoS**, where users are unable to interact with the contract due to excessive gas requirements.",1318,136,8.961379766464233
135,denial of service,"YES. It is vulnerable because the `lendGovernmentMoney` function contains a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability on line 46 and line 48 where the arrays `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` are reset to empty arrays (`new address ` and `new uint `). This reset can lead to situations where creditors expecting payouts are denied their payments due to the contract's inability to process them after resetting. The DoS attack can be triggered by manipulating the contract's state, especially when the contract tries to process a creditor payout after this reset.",2292,115,9.398666381835938
136,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function within the `Refunder` contract. Specifically, the line:

```solidity
require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));
```

This introduces a potential denial of service (DoS) vulnerability. If one of the addresses in `refundAddresses` cannot receive a refund due to the `send` function failing (for example, if the address is a contract that rejects the transaction or runs out of gas), it will revert the entire transaction. This will prevent other refunds from being processed, leading to a denial of service for all other addresses.",1201,132,7.0087199211120605
137,denial of service,"YES

The smart contract contains a vulnerability related to **Denial of Service (DoS)** due to high gas usage in the `DosOneFunc` contract's `ifillArray` function. Specifically:

1. The `for` loop in line 17 (`for(uint i=0;i<350;i++)`) and the corresponding `listAddresses.push(msg.sender)` on line 18 can cause gas consumption to increase significantly as the array grows. As the array approaches the 1500-address limit, adding more elements will require increasing amounts of gas. Eventually, this could result in the transaction exceeding the gas limit, making it impossible to execute further calls to the function.

Thus, this could block the contract from further use, causing a **Denial of Service**.",1095,156,9.532689332962036
138,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the following:

1. **Denial of Service via Fallback Function**: The first contract (`DosAuction`) includes a vulnerability where if the `currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid)` fails (due to the fallback function consuming all gas or malicious behavior), the auction can become stuck, as no new bids can proceed. This is a classic Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

2. **Gatekeeper Contract Call**: The second contract (`cyberEntry2`) is interacting with the `Gatekeeper` contract, which may have its own vulnerability. However, the vulnerability in focus here is the first contract's susceptibility to DoS through the `send` function.",1088,148,9.20454478263855
