72,unchecked low level calls,"YES

It is vulnerable because in line 14 (`target.call.value(msg.value)(data);`), the return value of the low-level `call` function is not checked. This can lead to unexpected behavior since `call` may fail silently, and the failure will not stop the contract execution. If the return value is not verified, the contract may behave as though the call succeeded, potentially causing fail-open vulnerabilities.",1256,84,6.1230738162994385

",1081,6,5.148924350738525
74,front running,"YES. The vulnerability in the given code lies in the function `checkBalances`. It attempts to use a dynamic array `balances` without initializing it properly and tries to return it as a storage array, which will lead to issues.

75,front running,NO,2101,1,3.201636552810669
76,front running,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable to a front-running attack for the same reasons mentioned earlier. The vulnerability still lies in the `play` function (line 29) where players' numbers are revealed, and this can be exploited by a malicious actor who observes the pending transaction on the blockchain and submits a higher gas fee to preempt the original player's transaction. This allows the attacker to gain an unfair advantage in determining the outcome of the game.",1300,89,5.9438745975494385
77,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in two places:

1. **Line 16 (`map[k] -= v;`)**: This is the same arithmetic underflow issue as in the first contract. Subtracting `v` from `map[k]` can cause an underflow if `v` is larger than `map[k]`, which can lead to unexpected behavior or exploits.

2. **Line 10-13 (`balances.push(addresses[i].balance);`)**: The `balances` array is declared as `storage`, but it is not properly initialized. Attempting to push values to an uninitialized `storage` array can cause the contract to fail. This could result in unintended consequences, but the critical issue here is the arithmetic underflow.",870,159,9.852409839630127
78,arithmetic,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the same line as before: `count *= input;` in the `run` function. This code can lead to an integer overflow when multiplying `count` by `input`, as Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0 do not automatically handle overflows and underflows for arithmetic operations.",850,71,5.591860294342041
79,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. 

**Reason**: The vulnerability is due to an uninitialized dynamic array `balances` in the `checkBalances` function. Using `storage` for the array without proper initialization can cause unexpected behavior or lead to manipulation of storage variables, which is risky. Additionally, this array is not properly managed, leading to potential out-of-gas exceptions or incorrect results. While this is a different issue from arithmetic overflow, it still presents a significant vulnerability in the contract.",846,101,5.936060905456543
80,arithmetic,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the line where the `count -= input;` operation occurs. This can result in an arithmetic underflow when `input` is greater than `count`, causing `count` to wrap around to a very large value due to the way unsigned integers work in Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0. Additionally, in the `checkBalances` function, using `storage` for the `balances` array is incorrect, as it should be a `memory` array. However, this mistake does not directly relate to the arithmetic vulnerability.",850,114,9.195604085922241
81,arithmetic,"YES, the vulnerability lies in the `increaseLockTime` function, which can cause an integer overflow on the `lockTime[msg.sender]` value when `_secondsToIncrease` is large enough.",1071,40,3.7987282276153564
82,arithmetic,"YES

The vulnerability in the second smart contract lies in the `checkBalances` function. The issue is with the use of `storage` instead of `memory` for the `balances` array. In Solidity, arrays that are declared as `storage` must be explicitly assigned to existing state variables, but this array is local to the function and not stored in contract storage. This leads to unintended behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

Additionally, the usage of `balances.push()` inside the loop will cause an error because `balances` is not correctly initialized or stored. Thus, the function will not work as expected, and there is a risk of memory-related vulnerabilities.",1148,131,9.689677000045776
83,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in two parts:

1. **Integer Overflow/Underflow in the `run` function**: Similar to the previous contract, the `count -= input;` operation on line 27 can cause an underflow if `input` is greater than `count`, leading to incorrect values for `count`. This vulnerability can be exploited to manipulate the contract's state.

2. **Potential Memory Issue in the `checkBalances` function**: The `balances` array is declared as `storage`, but it is being used like a dynamic in-memory array. This could lead to incorrect behavior or even corruption of the contract's state. It is also prone to gas limit issues when handling large arrays, making it inefficient and potentially vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks.",934,162,10.285889625549316
84,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the function `run(uint256 input)` where the subtraction `uint res = count - input;` can cause an underflow if `input` is greater than `count` (which is set to 1). Since Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0 do not handle underflows automatically, this can result in an unintended large value, creating an arithmetic vulnerability.",863,87,7.086229562759399
85,arithmetic,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. 

In the `checkBalances` function, the vulnerability arises from the improper use of the `storage` keyword. The `balances` array is declared with `storage`, but it is not linked to any existing storage data, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially causing a vulnerability. Additionally, similar to the first contract, the `run` function is vulnerable to an underflow, as there is no check to ensure that `count` is greater than or equal to `input` before subtracting it.",920,107,8.393511772155762
86,arithmetic,"YES

The contract is vulnerable due to the same arithmetic overflow and underflow issues present in the first contract. Specifically:

- In the function `overflowaddtostate(uint256 input)`, line 18: `count += input;`
- In the function `overflowmultostate(uint256 input)`, line 24: `count *= input;`
- In the function `underflowtostate(uint256 input)`, line 30: `count -= input;`
- In the function `overflowlocalonly(uint256 input)`, line 36: `uint res = count + input;`
- In the function `overflowmulocalonly(uint256 input)`, line 42: `uint res = count * input;`
- In the function `underflowlocalonly(uint256 input)`, line 48: `uint res = count - input;`

The `checkBalances` function is unrelated to these vulnerabilities.",1164,190,12.499544858932495
87,arithmetic,"YES

The vulnerability exists in both the `transfer` function (lines 22 and 24) due to potential underflow, and in the `checkBalances` function because the local `balances` array is incorrectly declared as `storage` instead of `memory`. This could result in issues with storing or accessing data during execution.",1061,66,8.206956624984741
88,arithmetic,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `count += input;` operation, which can result in an integer overflow when adding a large enough `input` to `count`. This type of vulnerability, known as an arithmetic overflow, can allow an attacker to manipulate the contract's state in unintended ways.",850,63,6.974607467651367
89,arithmetic,"YES

It is vulnerable because in line 21:

```solidity
sellerBalance += value;
```

There is a potential for an arithmetic overflow when adding the `value` to `sellerBalance`. In Solidity versions before 0.8, arithmetic operations do not automatically check for overflows or underflows. If `value` is large enough, the sum can exceed the maximum value of `uint`, causing an overflow. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the contract's behavior.",867,98,7.7771360874176025
90,arithmetic,"YES

The contract is vulnerable due to an integer overflow risk at the same line as before: `balanceOf[_to] += _value;`. This operation can result in an overflow if the sum exceeds the maximum value for a `uint256`. Moreover, the `checkBalances` function introduces another vulnerability related to uninitialized `storage` arrays, which can lead to unexpected behavior, potentially compromising the contract’s integrity.",925,84,6.7941107749938965
91,bad randomness,"YES. 

The vulnerability lies in the `checkBalances` function. The function attempts to return the balances of a list of addresses by pushing to a storage array (`balances`), but the storage array is not correctly initialized. In Solidity, dynamically resizing storage arrays must be explicitly declared or assigned to memory arrays. This can lead to a runtime error, making the contract vulnerable.

Furthermore, the use of `blockhash` in the `settle` function (line 35) remains vulnerable, as the blockhash can be predicted or influenced by miners. This adds to the contract's insecurity regarding randomness.",1156,121,10.135551452636719

94,bad randomness,"YES. 

The contract is vulnerable due to the randomness being based on `block.number % 2`, which is predictable and can be manipulated by miners. This flaw allows malicious users to predict the outcome and exploit the contract's ""makeBet"" function. Additionally, the `checkBalances` function is problematic because it attempts to use a `storage` array to hold balances in a loop, which can lead to out-of-gas issues or reentrancy vulnerabilities if not handled correctly.",1284,97,6.5912697315216064
95,bad randomness,"YES. 

The smart contract is vulnerable due to the same reason as previously mentioned. The vulnerability lies in the line:
```solidity
answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));

This method for generating randomness relies on `blockhash` and `now`, both of which are predictable and can be influenced by miners or attackers, allowing them to guess the random number. Therefore, the contract's randomness can be exploited, making it vulnerable.",1048,100,7.983388900756836
96,bad randomness,"YES, it is vulnerable because the randomness in the `random` function is still based on predictable values such as `block.timestamp` and `block.number`, making it susceptible to manipulation by miners or other malicious users.

134,denial of service,"YES. The function `checkBalances(address[] addresses)` is vulnerable because it can lead to a denial of service due to the unbounded loop over the provided `addresses` array. If the array is too large, the gas required to execute the loop will exceed the block gas limit, causing the transaction to fail. This effectively makes the function unusable with large inputs, leading to a potential denial of service situation.",1241,83,4.515105485916138
135,denial of service,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable because of the improper use of dynamic arrays and gas consumption risks. Specifically:

1. **Denial of Service (DoS) via Gas Limit**: In the `lendGovernmentMoney` function, when resetting the arrays `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` (lines 46 and 48), if the arrays are too large, resetting them could consume excessive gas, leading to a situation where the contract function becomes too costly to execute, resulting in a denial of service.

2. **Potential DoS on Payout**: The payout to creditors is done in a loop that sends funds to the creditors in the order they are stored. If an early creditor is a contract that fails to accept funds or runs out of gas, it will block subsequent creditors from being paid, leading to a DoS scenario.",2215,172,9.812824487686157
136,denial of service,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll()` function, where the `send` method is used to transfer funds. If one of the addresses in `refundAddresses` fails to receive the funds (e.g., due to the address reverting or running out of gas), the entire `refundAll()` function will revert, causing a denial of service and preventing any refunds from being processed. This is a classic vulnerability where a single failing transaction can block the execution of subsequent ones.",1124,101,9.019403219223022
137,denial of service,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the **`checkBalances`** function. It uses a **`for`** loop to push each address's balance into the **`balances`** array, which grows dynamically. If the input array of addresses is large, this can result in high gas consumption, potentially leading to a **denial of service (DoS)** due to gas exhaustion. The function's execution could run out of gas, causing the contract to fail and making it unusable.

Additionally, the **`balances`** array is declared as **`storage`** but not initialized, which also introduces a problem.",1018,131,8.878310680389404
138,denial of service,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to the same issue as the first code: it uses `currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid)` in line 25. This can lead to a denial of service if the `send` function fails, which could occur if the recipient uses all their gas or deliberately fails the transfer. The vulnerable point is the use of the `send` function, which limits the gas to 2300, and if this transfer fails, it will prevent new bids from being placed, leading to a denial of service for future bidders.",1011,113,8.267540216445923
