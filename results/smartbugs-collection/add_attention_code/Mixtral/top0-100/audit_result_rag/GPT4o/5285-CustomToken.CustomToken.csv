The smart contract is vulnerable because it uses `delegatecall` unsafely in two places:

1. **Line 31**: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(fibSig, withdrawalCounter));`
   - This uses `delegatecall` to call a function from an external contract (`fibonacciLibrary`). Since `delegatecall` runs the external code in the context of the calling contract, it inherits the calling contract's storage and permissions, which can be exploited to execute unauthorized actions or modify contract state maliciously.

2. **Line 38**: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(msg.data));`
   - Here, arbitrary data (`msg.data`) is passed to `delegatecall`, which allows any function call from the `fibonacciLibrary` to be executed in the current contract's context. This is highly risky as it gives an attacker the ability to execute arbitrary functions and possibly alter contract state without proper authorization.

The return value of the low-level `call()` is not checked, which can lead to a situation where the call fails, but the code continues execution, resulting in potential fail-open scenarios. This unchecked low-level call could allow malicious behavior or unintended outcomes, making the contract vulnerable.",1118,85,6.311362981796265
71,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `sendMoney` function, which uses the low-level `_target.call.value(_value)()`. This is dangerous because the return value of this call is not checked. If the call fails, the function will continue executing without reverting, which could lead to unintended outcomes. This makes the contract vulnerable to issues like failed fund transfers or other unexpected behavior, similar to the vulnerability you previously pointed out.",1166,86,9.256442785263062
72,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the unchecked use of `target.call.value(msg.value)(data);` in the `Proxy` contract's `proxy` function. This low-level `call` does not check the return value, meaning it could fail silently without reverting the transaction. This creates a potential fail-open vulnerability, where the contract might continue its execution even if the `call` fails, leading to unexpected behavior and security risks, especially in contracts handling funds.",1336,92,44.1986665725708
73,front running,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to a front-running attack. The vulnerability exists because both `setReward` and `claimReward` functions can be front-run. A malicious user can observe a transaction to claim the reward and send their own transaction with higher gas fees to preempt it, thus claiming the reward themselves before the original user. This stems from the lack of proper mechanisms to prevent front-running in the contract's design.",1161,86,7.834929466247559
74,front running,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability in the `FindThisHash` contract is still present due to the front-running risk on line 17: `require(hash == sha3(solution));`.

75,front running,"YES. It is vulnerable because the `approve` function allows for front-running attacks. A malicious actor can observe a transaction with an `approve` call, then submit their own transaction with a higher gas fee, causing their transaction to be processed first. This can enable them to exploit allowances, resulting in unauthorized transfers.",2181,63,6.897195816040039
76,front running,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

It is vulnerable to a **front-running attack** at line 25, specifically in the `play` function where users submit their numbers. The vulnerability stems from the fact that the Ethereum blockchain is public, and anyone can see pending transactions. An attacker can observe another player's submission and front-run the transaction by submitting their own transaction with a higher gas fee, thus manipulating the game result. The lack of any mechanism to prevent such manipulation (e.g., a commit-reveal scheme) makes the contract susceptible to front-running.",1380,112,10.437085628509521
77,arithmetic,"YES, it is vulnerable because the same vulnerability exists in the `init` function of the `IntegerOverflowMappingSym1` contract.

78,arithmetic,"YES. The vulnerability in this contract lies in the `count *= input;` operation in the `IntegerOverflowMul` contract. The arithmetic operation does not have any protection against overflows or underflows, which was common in older Solidity versions like `0.4.19`. This could allow an attacker to pass a large `input` value that causes `count` to overflow, resulting in unintended behavior such as resetting the value to zero or another incorrect value.

Additionally, the contract does not use the `SafeMath` library, which could prevent this kind of vulnerability.",930,115,10.717214345932007
79,arithmetic,"YES, it is vulnerable because the same issue of integer overflow applies. Specifically, in the `Overflow_Add` contract, the `balance += deposit;` line could result in an overflow if a sufficiently large value is passed as the `deposit`. Since Solidity 0.4.25 does not include automatic overflow protection, this vulnerability allows the balance to wrap around, leading to unexpected behaviors or exploitation.

93,bad randomness,"YES. The vulnerability in the contract lies in the `rand` function, which uses `block.blockhash(lastBlockNumber)` to generate randomness. This approach is predictable and susceptible to manipulation by miners. Because miners can influence the `blockhash` value for recent blocks, they could potentially predict the output of the `rand` function and exploit it to their advantage, thereby compromising the fairness of the random selection process.

Since miners can manipulate `block.timestamp` within a certain range, this allows them to influence the outcome of the contract, particularly in the condition `if(now % 15 == 0)`, making the contract susceptible to time manipulation.",1095,89,6.233546495437622
131,time manipulation,"YES. The contract is vulnerable due to the use of `block.timestamp` in the generation of randomness in the line:

```solidity
var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;
```

This relies on the block timestamp, which can be manipulated by miners, leading to potential exploitation. Additionally, using `block.timestamp` for randomness is a known vulnerability, as it can result in predictable outcomes. This is a case of both time manipulation and bad randomness.",1205,97,8.119105577468872
132,short addresses,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability arises due to the potential for **short address attacks** in the `sendCoin` function in the `MyToken` contract, specifically when handling the `address` type. This vulnerability can occur when poorly coded clients incorrectly encode or pad the address argument, allowing attackers to exploit this by crafting malicious transactions. The contract does not contain any protection or validation mechanism to ensure that the length of the address argument is correct, which exposes it to the short address vulnerability.",1253,100,16.95446538925171
133,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `emptyCreditors()` function. Specifically, the condition `if(creditorAddresses.length > 1500)` combined with resetting the array `creditorAddresses = new address ` can lead to a denial of service (DoS). If the `creditorAddresses` array grows large enough, resetting the array can consume a significant amount of gas, making it impossible to execute due to the block gas limit. This may result in the function becoming uncallable, effectively locking up the contract in a denial-of-service situation.",1221,112,10.684245586395264
134,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function. Specifically, the issue is caused by the dynamic resizing of the `array` in a loop (`array.length += 1;`). This operation can result in a gas limit exhaustion, which could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if an attacker calls this function with a large value for `numbers`. The function will attempt to continuously resize the array and insert values, which can consume a large amount of gas, causing the transaction to fail and potentially rendering the contract unusable.",1321,117,9.932920932769775
135,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable because the code contains potential for a **denial of service** attack, particularly due to lines like `creditorAddresses = new address ;` and `creditorAmounts = new uint ;`. These lines reset the creditor lists, which could lead to denial of service, as future creditors or legitimate transactions might be blocked from execution.",2295,71,5.897961616516113
136,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability in the `Refunder` contract lies in the same line as the original: 

```solidity
require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));
```

This line makes the contract vulnerable to a **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack. If one of the recipients in `refundAddresses` fails to accept the refund (due to failing the `send` operation), the entire `refundAll` function will revert, blocking refunds to all other addresses in the array. This makes the contract vulnerable, as a single failure can prevent the entire function from completing.",1204,124,10.077613353729248
137,denial of service,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to the denial of service (DoS) attack in the `ifillArray` function. Specifically:

1. **Gas Limit Issue (Denial of Service)**: The loop in the `ifillArray` function pushes the `msg.sender` address into the `listAddresses` array 350 times when the `listAddresses` length is less than 1500. As the array grows, the gas required to execute this loop increases. Eventually, the function may exceed the block's gas limit, preventing further execution of the function and causing a denial of service.

This vulnerability can prevent users from interacting with the contract once it hits the gas limit.",1098,139,9.8665771484375
138,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because the `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack. If the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that has a fallback function that fails or runs out of gas, the `send` will fail, and the entire bidding process will be blocked, preventing other users from bidding.",1091,81,9.017301797866821
