The `Wallet` contract has an access control vulnerability. Specifically, the `PushBonusCode`, `PopBonusCode`, and `UpdateBonusCodeAt` functions are all public, which allows any user to modify the `bonusCodes` array without restrictions. Furthermore, the `PopBonusCode` function has a logic flaw in the requirement `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length);` since this condition will always be true for an unsigned integer (array length). This allows any user to reduce the length of the array arbitrarily.

The `Foo` contract also presents an access control issue, as any user can invoke the `doit` function to transfer the full balance of the token from the hardcoded address to any beneficiary, potentially leading to unauthorized token transfers.",1198,155,12.313831090927124
19,access control,"YES. The vulnerability in the contract lies in the constructor definition `function Constructor()`. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, constructors should not have a function keyword and must have the same name as the contract. Since the function is named `Constructor` but does not match the contract name `Missing`, it will not be recognized as the constructor, making it a regular public function. This allows anyone to call the `Constructor` function and set themselves as the owner, bypassing access control and enabling unauthorized withdrawals.

26,access control,"YES

The vulnerability arises from the reckless use of `delegatecall`, which is an access control issue. The `delegatecall` on lines 31 and 38 in the `FibonacciBalance` contract allows the external contract (`fibonacciLibrary`) to execute code in the context of the calling contract. This could potentially allow an attacker to exploit the contract by replacing the `fibonacciLibrary` address with a malicious contract, thus gaining control over the `withdraw` and fallback functions. This bypasses access control and could lead to unauthorized fund transfers or state manipulation.",1428,113,24.086188316345215

Since `call()` returns a boolean value indicating success or failure, and the result is not checked, this can lead to unexpected failures (such as the external contract not processing the call correctly) without stopping the contract execution.

This unchecked `call` usage introduces a risk of fail-open behavior, where the failure of an external call is ignored, leading to potential vulnerabilities such as fund mismanagement or inconsistencies in the contract's logic.",1093,155,9.511792182922363

The vulnerability in the second smart contract is the same as the one in the first. The `send` function is used in both `sendToWinner` and `withdrawLeftOver` without checking the return values. This makes it vulnerable to failures in sending ether, which could cause the contract to behave unexpectedly.

Additionally, in the second contract (`Foo`), the transfer operation in `doit` checks the return value of the `transfer` function, but it does not handle the case if the transfer fails (for example, if `transfer` returns `false`). Although the `require` statement will revert if `transfer` fails, it does not fully mitigate risks such as handling gas issues or reentrancy attacks in the contract.",1085,150,8.964093685150146

65,unchecked low level calls,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the unchecked low-level call in the `airDrop` contract at line 17, where the return value of `caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],_value)` is not checked.

66,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the unchecked low-level calls present in both the original code and the evaluated code. Specifically:

1. **Line 44 in the original contract**: `token.call(bytes4(sha3(""transfer(address,uint256)"")),to,amount);`
   - This is a low-level call to transfer tokens using `call()`. The return value of the `call()` function is not checked, which means that if the call fails, it will not revert the transaction, and the execution will continue, potentially leading to fund loss or other unintended behaviors.

2. **Line 97 in the original contract**: `_addr.call.value(_wei);`
   - Similar to the previous point, this low-level call sends Ether to an address using `call()`, and again, the return value is not checked. If the call fails, Ether might not be sent, but the contract will proceed, which could be exploited.

These low-level calls should check for success using return values to ensure safe and reliable execution of the functions.",1744,211,15.651981353759766
67,unchecked low level calls,"YES

It is vulnerable because the contract uses the low-level `call` function on line 29: `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);`. The return value of this low-level call is not checked, meaning if the call fails, the contract will not revert, leading to potential security issues such as fail-open behavior. This could result in unexpected outcomes if the called contract or address does not execute properly.",1405,83,7.758904695510864
68,unchecked low level calls,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to the unchecked low-level call on line 25 in the `keepMyEther` contract. The `msg.sender.call.value(balances[msg.sender])()` is a low-level call that does not check for a return value, which can result in failure scenarios being ignored, leading to potential issues such as reentrancy attacks. If the call fails, the balance is still set to 0, which can allow the contract to lose Ether without performing the intended withdrawal.",1046,102,8.409093618392944
69,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of the `call()` function in the `Command()` function, specifically at this line:

```solidity
adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);

Since `call()` is a low-level function, it does not throw an error if the called function fails. Instead, it returns a boolean indicating success or failure, and the return value is not being checked here. If the call fails, the contract will continue executing, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.

This is a classic case of unchecked low-level calls, which can be exploited.",1169,125,7.480817794799805
70,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the use of the low-level `call()` function in the `EBU` contract without checking its return value. In the line `caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v[i]);`, if the call fails, it won't revert the transaction, and since the return value is not checked, the function will continue execution as if nothing went wrong. This can lead to unintended behavior, such as fund transfers not being properly executed.

Additionally, the `Foo` contract is vulnerable because it doesn't validate the token address or balance before calling the transfer, which could lead to unintended consequences if the token address is malicious or invalid.",1099,132,10.47260570526123
71,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The vulnerability exists in the `sendMoney` function. It uses a low-level `.call.value()` which doesn't check the return value, similar to the previous code.

The vulnerability in the given smart contract is related to front-running. Specifically:

- In the `EthTxOrderDependenceMinimal` contract, the functions `setReward()` and `claimReward(uint256 submission)` both have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by front-running attacks. This occurs because both functions involve transferring rewards (`owner.transfer(reward)` and `msg.sender.transfer(reward)`), and their conditions are based on publicly visible state variables like `claimed`. Miners or other users can observe the pending transaction on the network and submit a competing transaction with higher gas fees to claim the reward before the original transaction is mined. This makes the contract susceptible to front-running, which can lead to loss of funds for legitimate users attempting to interact with it.",1142,151,8.921011686325073
74,front running,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `solve` function of the `FindThisHash` contract. Since the solution is submitted as a plain string, an attacker could observe the solution in a pending transaction on the blockchain and submit the same solution with a higher gas fee, front-running the original transaction. This would allow the attacker to claim the reward of 1000 ether before the original user, making the contract vulnerable to front-running attacks.",1088,92,6.502356290817261
75,front running,"YES, the second smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability exists due to the front-running risk in the `doit` function of the `Foo` contract. Since the function transfers the entire balance of a specific address (`0xA63409Bed5Cde1Befd8565aCF4702759058Ad585`) to the specified beneficiary, an attacker can monitor this pending transaction and submit their own transaction with a higher gas fee to front-run the original one.

77,arithmetic,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `IntegerOverflowMappingSym1` contract, specifically in line 16: `map[k] -= v;`. This can lead to an underflow, where subtracting a large value from a smaller one results in an incorrect value due to the limitations of unsigned integers in Solidity.

Additionally, in the `Foo` contract, there is a potential vulnerability in the `doit` function. The balance of the address `0xA63409Bed5Cde1Befd8565aCF4702759058Ad585` is transferred without any checks on the balance, which can lead to security issues if the `transfer` function fails or does not handle edge cases properly.",931,149,13.094923496246338

The vulnerability in the `IntegerOverflowAdd` contract stems from the potential for an integer overflow when adding to the `balanceOf[_to]` variable. In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, arithmetic operations do not automatically check for overflows, which could allow an attacker to cause an overflow in the `balanceOf[_to]` variable, leading to an incorrect balance or potential theft.

In the `Foo` contract, there is a potential vulnerability as well. The `token.transfer()` function is used, but the return value is only checked through the `require` statement. However, the contract does not perform any checks on the `token.balanceOf()` function call, which could potentially lead to an issue if the external token contract behaves unexpectedly or the balance queried leads to incorrect values being transferred.",986,172,8.68700623512268
91,bad randomness,"YES. 

The vulnerability is in the `PredictTheBlockHashChallenge` contract. The issue lies with using `blockhash(guesses[msg.sender].block)` to determine the outcome. Since the `blockhash` function can only retrieve block hashes for the most recent 256 blocks, this introduces a vulnerability if the settlement is delayed beyond that window. Additionally, blockhash can be influenced by miners, making it unsuitable for generating secure randomness. Therefore, malicious actors could predict or manipulate the outcome.",1217,100,6.479267597198486

The vulnerability lies in the randomness generation in the `chooseWinner` function. Specifically:

1. **Line 99**: `address seed1 = contestants[uint(block.coinbase) % totalTickets].addr;`

2. **Line 101**: `address seed2 = contestants[uint(msg.sender) % totalTickets].addr;`  
   - `msg.sender` is predictable, as it is the address of the contract calling the function, which is fully controlled by an attacker.

3. **Line 103**: `uint seed3 = block.difficulty;`  
   - `block.difficulty` is also subject to miner influence, making it insecure for randomness.

The vulnerability lies in the random number generation mechanism in the `rand()` function. The use of `block.blockhash(lastBlockNumber)` (line 130) to generate a random value is insecure, as block hashes can be predicted or influenced by miners. This allows malicious actors to predict the outcome of the random number generation, thus compromising the fairness of the contract's logic that relies on randomness.",2915,81,7.693461179733276

The vulnerability lies in the `makeBet` function of the `Lottery` contract, where it uses `block.number % 2 == 0` as a source of randomness. This is predictable and can be exploited by miners or anyone who can anticipate the block number. They could potentially manipulate the outcome by choosing to make a bet on even or odd block numbers.

Additionally, in the `Foo` contract, using `token.balanceOf(0xA63409Bed5Cde1Befd8565aCF4702759058Ad585)` could present risks if the account's balance is manipulated or if this is an incorrect or malicious address.",1345,139,16.92280912399292

The vulnerability arises from the use of `block.blockhash(block.number - 1)` and `now` (which is the current block timestamp) in the `GuessTheRandomNumberChallenge` contract to generate the random number (`answer`). These values are not truly random and can be predicted or influenced by miners. Specifically:

- **Blockhash predictability**: The blockhash for recent blocks is known, and miners can manipulate the timing or selection of block attributes.
- **Timestamp manipulation**: The block timestamp (`now`) can be slightly adjusted by miners, making the random number generation more predictable.

This predictability allows a malicious actor to replicate the random number and exploit the contract.",1109,146,10.745881795883179

The vulnerability is related to the use of predictable sources for randomness in the `RandomNumberGenerator` contract. Specifically:

1. **Line 12:** `uint256 private salt =  block.timestamp;` â€” Block timestamps can be influenced by miners and are not truly random.
   
2. **Line 18:** `uint256 y = salt * block.number / (salt % 5);` â€” This uses `block.number`, which is predictable and publicly accessible, reducing the unpredictability.

3. **Line 20:** `uint256 seed = block.number / 3 + (salt % 300) + y;` â€” The seed value is predictable due to reliance on `block.number` and `salt`, both of which are subject to manipulation or prediction.

4. **Line 22:** `uint256 h = uint256(blockhash(seed));` â€” `blockhash` can only access hashes of the most recent 256 blocks, making this a potentially weak source of randomness as well.

The second smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack due to the use of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `CashOut` function, which allows external calls. This low-level call can lead to a reentrancy attack, as it gives the external contract an opportunity to re-enter the `CashOut` function before the state (i.e., balances) is updated. Therefore, an attacker could repeatedly withdraw funds before the balance is reduced, draining the contract.",1454,102,9.240509748458862
121,reentrancy,NO,1606,1,4.370364189147949
122,reentrancy,"YES. The vulnerability in the `Private_Bank` contract lies in the `CashOut` function. It uses a low-level `call` function (`if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())`) to transfer Ether, which is susceptible to a reentrancy attack. An attacker could repeatedly call the `CashOut` function before the balance is updated, allowing them to drain funds from the contract.",1468,81,4.203812599182129
123,reentrancy,"**YES**: The vulnerability is a reentrancy attack in the `Collect` function, specifically at the line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This line allows an external call to be made to the `msg.sender` before the contractâ€™s state (i.e., the balance of the account) is updated. This means that an attacker could re-enter the contract during this call and repeatedly withdraw funds by recursively calling `Collect` before the balance is updated, draining the contract of its funds.",1564,108,11.065983057022095
124,reentrancy,"YES. The contract is vulnerable due to the reentrancy attack in the `CashOut` function. The line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

allows an external contract to call back into the `CashOut` function before the initial execution is complete. This can be exploited by repeatedly calling the function and draining funds before the contract's balance is updated.",1454,80,7.793533802032471
125,reentrancy,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the use of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `Collect` function. This low-level call can enable a reentrancy attack, allowing an external contract to call back into the `Collect` function before the balance is updated, potentially draining funds from the contract.",1608,63,8.657438516616821
126,reentrancy,NO,1066,1,7.077978134155273
127,time manipulation,"YES. The contract is vulnerable to time manipulation because it uses `block.timestamp` in the `TimedCrowdsale` contract to determine if the sale is finished. Miners can manipulate the block timestamp slightly, potentially exploiting this to trigger or delay the sale ending.",974,53,3.3259828090667725
128,time manipulation,NO,1209,1,2.9756414890289307
129,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` in the `Governmental` contract. Specifically, miners can manipulate `block.timestamp`, which is used in the `resetInvestment` function to check the time difference since the last investment. This reliance on a manipulable value can lead to timing attacks, making the contract susceptible to exploitation by an attacker who can influence the timing logic.",1377,83,9.827981948852539
130,time manipulation,"YES, the vulnerability still exists in the `Roulette` contract because it relies on the `now` (or `block.timestamp`) value for critical logic. Specifically:

- In line 18, `require(now != pastBlockTime);` allows only one transaction per block, but since miners can manipulate the `block.timestamp`, they can exploit this condition.
- In line 20, `pastBlockTime = now;` stores the current block time, which can also be manipulated by miners to their advantage.

Thus, the contract is vulnerable to time manipulation exploits.",1076,114,9.718287467956543
131,time manipulation,"YES

The vulnerability in the smart contract is due to the use of `block.timestamp` for randomness in the `EtherLotto` contract (line 43: `var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;`). The value of `block.timestamp` can be influenced by miners to some extent, which makes it insecure for generating random values. This creates an opportunity for miners to manipulate the outcome of the lottery, especially if they can benefit from winning.",1186,96,8.221957683563232
132,short addresses,NO,1234,1,4.047484636306763
133,denial of service,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function in the `DosGas` contract. Specifically, when the length of `creditorAddresses` exceeds 1500, the contract attempts to reset the array by setting `creditorAddresses = new address `. This operation can consume an excessive amount of gas, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors and preventing the function from being successfully executed, thus making the contract susceptible to a denial of service attack.",1202,102,10.865670919418335
134,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability in the first contract stems from the loop in the `insertNnumbers` function. This loop dynamically increases the size of the array during runtime by incrementing `array.length`. This can lead to excessive gas consumption, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if the function call runs out of gas before completion.

In the second contract, while it has a new `doit` function, the vulnerability still exists within the `insertNnumbers` function for the same reasons: dynamically resizing the array can lead to DoS through gas exhaustion.",1302,115,8.335927963256836
135,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability is in the `Foo` contract. It contains a potential **Denial of Service (DoS)** vulnerability because the `token.transfer()` call sends the entire balance of the token contract (using `token.balanceOf()`), and if the recipient is a contract that rejects or misbehaves when receiving tokens, it could cause the transaction to fail and prevent the function from completing.

This DoS risk arises from relying on external calls to untrusted contracts (such as another contract as the beneficiary) without checking the behavior or outcome.",2276,110,9.13857388496399
136,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function of the `Refunder` contract, where the use of `send` can lead to a **Denial of Service (DoS)**. If one address in `refundAddresses` fails to receive the refund (e.g., due to gas limitations or malicious behavior), the entire loop will stop, preventing any further refunds. Additionally, the `Foo` contract also has a potential vulnerability because it uses `require` on `token.transfer`, which could similarly cause a DoS if the transfer fails.",1185,112,10.027729272842407
137,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function in the `DosOneFunc` contract. The for-loop inside this function pushes the sender's address into the `listAddresses` array 350 times, which can lead to high gas consumption as the size of the array grows. Once the gas limit is exceeded, the function can no longer be executed, leading to a denial of service.

Additionally, the `doit` function in the `Foo` contract depends on the `transfer` method of the `IERC20Token` token. If the token transfer fails or consumes too much gas, it could also result in a denial of service in this function.",1079,139,10.035422563552856
138,denial of service,"YES. It is vulnerable because the `currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid)` in the `DosAuction` contract can fail if the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that does not accept Ether or has a fallback function that consumes a large amount of gas. This would block the bid process, resulting in a denial of service for future bids.",1072,73,6.382782459259033
