11,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because the `newOwner` function (line 38) allows any user to assign themselves as an owner by calling the function and setting themselves as the owner of another address. This can lead to unauthorized access and ownership modifications, representing an access control vulnerability.",1277,58,6.820529222488403
12,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `missing()` function, which is meant to set the contract owner but is defined as `public`. This allows anyone to call the function and reset the owner of the contract, effectively taking control of it.

13,access control,"YES, the vulnerability lies in the constructor function `DynamicPyramid()`, which lacks the `constructor` keyword and is written as a regular function in Solidity version 0.4.15. As a result, anyone can call this function after deployment, allowing them to change the owner of the contract. This violates access control, allowing unauthorized users to gain control over the contract.",2935,76,9.415608167648315
14,access control,"YES. The vulnerability exists in the following part of the `Wallet` contract:

- In the `withdraw` function, the condition `require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);` is incorrect. It should be `require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);` because the current condition allows users to withdraw more than they actually have in their balance, leading to a security issue related to access control.

Additionally, the `migrateTo` function allows the creator to transfer the entire balance of the contract to an arbitrary address without any safeguards, which is an access control vulnerability, allowing the creator to drain funds without proper restrictions.",1132,122,12.270187854766846
15,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `IamMissing()` function. It allows anyone to become the contract owner by calling this public function, which sets `owner = msg.sender`. This lack of proper access control permits unauthorized users to take control of the contract and withdraw funds using the `withdraw()` function.",1025,60,8.982993364334106
16,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function of the `Map` contract, where access control is too weak. While the contract checks `msg.sender == owner`, there is no way to set or change the `owner` address, meaning it could potentially be exploited if deployed with a non-owner account or if ownership changes aren't properly managed. Additionally, in the `Airdrop` contract, unchecked input such as the `dests` and `values` arrays can be exploited in a variety of ways, such as reentrancy or overflow vulnerabilities, depending on other conditions of the blockchain environment.",1090,128,13.289331912994385
17,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `delegatecall` in the `Proxy` contract, similar to the first example. The `delegatecall` is used to execute code in the context of the caller's contract, which can be dangerous if the `callee` is an untrusted contract. This could allow the `callee` contract to execute malicious code with the same privileges as the `Proxy` contract, including potentially modifying the `owner` state variable or other critical data.

Additionally, the `Airdrop` contract also allows anyone to call the `doAirdrop` function, which could be used to exploit the `ERC20` token transfer by executing unauthorized transactions on behalf of the contract caller. This lack of access control makes the system vulnerable to misuse.",993,162,12.233625411987305
18,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the function `PopBonusCode()`. The line `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length);` is always true because array lengths are unsigned. The contract decreases the array length directly without checking if the array is already empty. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security risks. Additionally, there is no access control in place to restrict who can call functions like `PushBonusCode()`, `PopBonusCode()`, and `UpdateBonusCodeAt()`, allowing anyone to manipulate the contract's data.",1186,111,6.660088539123535
19,access control,"YES. The vulnerability in the `Missing` contract lies in the incorrect definition of the constructor. The function `Constructor()` is incorrectly named with an uppercase ""C"". In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, the constructor must match the contract name exactly (case-sensitive), which means that `Constructor()` will be treated as a regular function instead of the contract's constructor. This leaves the `owner` variable uninitialized, allowing anyone to call the `withdraw()` function and drain the contract's funds.

In the `Airdrop` contract, there is a lack of proper checks in the `doAirdrop` function to ensure that the token transfers are successful. If the transfer fails, the function does not revert, which could lead to incorrect execution and possible loss of funds.

Both contracts exhibit vulnerabilities related to access control and unsafe coding practices.",1015,173,15.330025434494019
20,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `initWallet` function, where any external party can call it and set themselves as the contract's creator. This allows unauthorized users to gain control of the contract, leading to potential misuse or loss of funds.",1150,49,10.853392601013184
21,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `tx.origin` for access control in the `MyContract` contract.

22,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `refund()` function. There is no access control in place, which allows any user to call `refund()` and withdraw their entire balance. This can be exploited if the function was intended for use only by specific users or under certain conditions. Additionally, the `migrateTo()` function allows the `creator` to transfer the contract's entire balance to any address, which could be risky without further restrictions or conditions.",1170,90,8.266010284423828

26,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `delegatecall` on lines 31 and 38 in the `FibonacciBalance` contract. `delegatecall` executes code in the context of the calling contract (i.e., `FibonacciBalance`), allowing external contracts (like `fibonacciLibrary`) to modify its storage. If the `fibonacciLibrary` contract is compromised or malicious, it could manipulate the storage and logic of `FibonacciBalance`, potentially leading to unauthorized access or fund withdrawals.

27,unchecked low level calls,"YES. The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in the use of low-level calls in the `Command` function (`adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);`) without checking the return value.

28,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The contract is vulnerable due to the use of `send()` on lines 54 and 65, which is a low-level call in Solidity. The `send()` function only forwards 2300 gas, which may not be enough for certain operations, and it does not throw an exception on failure. Instead, it returns `false` if the transfer fails, but the return value is not being checked in this contract, leading to potential loss of funds or other unintended behaviors.

29,unchecked low level calls,"YES. 

The vulnerability exists in the use of the low-level call function at line 39: `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);`. This call does not check the return value, meaning it could fail silently without reverting the transaction, leading to potential security issues. If the call fails, the contract could behave unexpectedly, which might result in the loss of funds or other unintended consequences. Additionally, the use of `transferFrom` in the `Airdrop` contract does not check return values, which could introduce further vulnerabilities in specific implementations of the ERC20 token.",1305,116,15.727122068405151

The vulnerability lies in the use of the low-level `call()` function in the `Centra4` contract, specifically at line 21: `contract_address.call(""register"", ""CentraToken"");`. This function is unchecked, meaning that even if the call fails, it does not revert the transaction and continues execution, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.

Similarly, in the `Airdrop` contract, there is no check on the result of `ERC20(_tokenAddr).transferFrom(...)`. If the transfer fails, the contract will still proceed with the loop, which may lead to issues if the function does not handle failures properly.

Since the return value is not checked, this can lead to potential failure scenarios where funds are not transferred as expected but the contract still continues execution, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or loss of funds.

In the second contract, the `Airdrop` contract is not vulnerable in the same way, as it uses the `transferFrom()` function of the ERC20 token standard, which behaves differently from the low-level `send()` function.

1. The call to `token.call(bytes4(sha3(""transfer(address,uint256)"")),to,amount);` in the `WithdrawToken` function. This low-level call does not check the return value, which means if the call fails (for example, due to insufficient gas or if the token contract does not implement the transfer function correctly), the contract will continue execution without reverting, potentially leading to unintended behavior.

2. In the `WithdrawToHolder` function, the use of `_addr.call.value(_wei)()` also introduces risk. Similar to the previous issue, if the call fails, it returns `false`, but there is no check to handle this failure.

This makes the contract susceptible to malicious exploitation through arithmetic underflows.",1110,147,11.946107625961304
88,arithmetic,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to a potential integer overflow in the `Airdrop` contract, specifically in the loop within the `doAirdrop` function.

The loop uses an index `i` to iterate over the `dests` array, and if the length of the array is large enough, this index can overflow, causing unexpected behavior. Additionally, since this code is written in Solidity version `0.4.19`, there are no built-in checks to prevent such overflows, making this a vulnerability.

",899,108,33.968920946121216

In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, arithmetic operations like addition do not check for overflows by default, meaning `sellerBalance` can overflow, allowing for unintended values.

Additionally, in the second contract (`Airdrop`), although not directly related to arithmetic, there could be a potential gas limit issue due to the loop in the `doAirdrop` function. However, this would need a separate evaluation beyond the specified ""arithmetic.sol"" vulnerability.",916,138,10.217180728912354

91,bad randomness,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability arises from the use of `blockhash(guesses[msg.sender].block)` in the `settle` function, as mentioned in the previous example.

94,bad randomness,NO,1333,1,5.509785175323486
95,bad randomness,"YES

The given smart contract is vulnerable for the following reasons:

1. **Predictable Randomness**: The vulnerability in the `GuessTheRandomNumberChallenge` contract lies in the line where `answer` is assigned:
   ```solidity
   answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));
   ```
   The `block.blockhash` and `now` (i.e., the block timestamp) are not suitable sources for generating secure randomness. Both of these values are potentially predictable or subject to manipulation by miners, which allows an attacker to deduce the value of `answer` and correctly guess it to drain the contract of funds.

2. **Loop in Airdrop Contract**: The `Airdrop` contract contains a loop that iterates over the addresses in `dests`:
   ```solidity
   while (i < dests.length) {
       ERC20(_tokenAddr).transferFrom(msg.sender, dests[i], values[i]);
       i += 1;
   }

96,bad randomness,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable because the `RandomNumberGenerator` contract still relies on predictable sources for randomness, similar to the earlier example. Specifically:

- **Line 12:** `uint256 private salt = block.timestamp;` — The block timestamp is used as a source of randomness, which can be influenced by miners.
- **Line 18:** `uint256 y = salt * block.number / (salt % 5);` — The block number and the previously predictable `salt` value are used in generating the `y` value.
- **Line 20:** `uint256 seed = block.number / 3 + (salt % 300) + y;` — The seed value relies on the block number and the predictable `salt` value.
- **Line 22:** `uint256 h = uint256(blockhash(seed));` — The block hash is used for randomness, but for past blocks, this can be somewhat predictable.

126,reentrancy,"YES, the first contract (`Reentrancy_insecure`) is vulnerable because it allows a reentrancy attack at line 17, where the external call to `msg.sender` is made before updating the balance. This can allow an attacker to repeatedly call the `withdrawBalance` function before the state is updated, draining the contract of funds.",1054,69,7.6207664012908936
127,time manipulation,"YES

The vulnerability in this smart contract lies in the `TimedCrowdsale` contract, which relies on `block.timestamp` in the `isSaleFinished` function. As mentioned earlier, the timestamp can be manipulated by miners within a certain range, leading to potential exploitation. This makes the contract vulnerable to time manipulation attacks.",962,66,9.032620429992676
128,time manipulation,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable due to the same reasons previously mentioned regarding the use of `now` and `block.timestamp` for time manipulation in lines 13 and 27. These can be manipulated by miners to exploit the contract's logic, leading to incorrect payouts or randomness generation. The reliance on the block timestamp for generating random numbers also introduces a potential vulnerability for manipulation, which can compromise the randomness and fairness of the system.",1197,87,23.090615272521973
129,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` in the `resetInvestment` function, specifically in the line: 

```solidity
if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp + ONE_MINUTE) throw;
```

Relying on `block.timestamp` for time-sensitive logic introduces the risk of manipulation by miners, as they can slightly adjust the timestamp of the blocks they mine, potentially affecting the conditions under which this function is executed. This makes the contract vulnerable to time manipulation attacks.",1365,106,11.59054160118103
130,time manipulation,"YES

The vulnerability still exists in the `Roulette` contract due to the reliance on `now` (or `block.timestamp`), which can be manipulated by miners, as mentioned earlier. The line `require(now != pastBlockTime);` is vulnerable because miners have some flexibility in controlling the block's timestamp, allowing them to potentially exploit the contract and bypass the condition. This could lead to unwanted or multiple executions within the same block.

The vulnerability is in the `Roulette` contract, not the `Airdrop` contract.",1064,109,11.26375675201416
131,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` to generate randomness in the `EtherLotto` contract. Miners can manipulate the timestamp, which affects the value of `random` in line 43. This could potentially allow a miner to influence the outcome of the lottery, making the contract susceptible to manipulation.",1174,66,5.686249732971191
132,short addresses,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the potential for a **short address attack** when the `Airdrop` contract calls `ERC20(_tokenAddr).transferFrom`. If an attacker provides a short address, the EVM may incorrectly pad it, causing improper encoding of the transaction arguments, which could allow attackers to manipulate the transaction data or exploit the behavior of poorly coded clients. This is similar to the vulnerability discussed in the `sendCoin` function.",1222,95,9.702708005905151
133,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability exists in the `emptyCreditors` function of the `DosGas` contract, specifically with the potential for gas exhaustion. When the `creditorAddresses.length` exceeds 1500, setting the array to a new empty array (`creditorAddresses = new address `) could consume a large amount of gas due to the need to clear a large array. This could make the function call fail, leading to a denial of service, as the array would not be cleared and the contract's state would not be updated, potentially blocking further operations.",1190,113,10.763237237930298
134,denial of service,"YES, the contract is vulnerable due to the `doAirdrop` function in the `Airdrop` contract. The loop in this function is unbounded, meaning if the `dests` array is large, it can consume excessive gas, leading to a denial of service. This could prevent the function from completing, leaving the contract in an unusable state.",1290,75,5.7034337520599365
135,denial of service,"YES. It is vulnerable because the `doAirdrop` function in the `Airdrop` contract uses a `while` loop with no bounds or gas limit checks. If the `dests` array becomes too large, it could consume all available gas, leading to a denial of service (DoS) situation where the function cannot complete and reverts. This is a classic case of gas limit exhaustion, resulting in a denial of service.",2264,91,9.096834182739258
136,denial of service,"YES, the contract is vulnerable because it uses the `send` function in the `refundAll` function without properly handling potential failures. If any address in `refundAddresses` rejects the payment (either deliberately or due to insufficient gas), the entire loop will fail, causing a denial of service for all subsequent refunds. This makes the contract susceptible to a denial-of-service attack.",1173,75,4.89588475227356
137,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability in the `Airdrop` contract is a potential **denial of service (DoS) attack via gas limit exhaustion**. Specifically, the `doAirdrop` function contains a `while` loop (`while (i < dests.length)`), which could process a large number of addresses (`dests`) in one transaction. If the number of addresses becomes too large, the transaction could run out of gas, leading to the function failing and making it impossible to execute further airdrops. This would prevent the contract from functioning correctly and could be exploited to cause a denial of service.",1067,125,10.941482782363892
138,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `bid` function of the `DosAuction` contract, specifically in the line where `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid))` is used. This can lead to a **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack if the `send` function fails (e.g., if the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that rejects the transfer or runs out of gas). In such cases, no further bids would be accepted, effectively freezing the auction.",1060,103,8.521992921829224
