11,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function of the `MultiOwnable` contract. This function allows any external address to add a new owner without restriction beyond checking that the address is not `0`. Since there are no checks to ensure that only an authorized owner can call this function, an attacker can potentially add themselves as an owner, gaining unauthorized access to the contract's functionality.

",1352,86,7.395472764968872
12,access control,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to the following reasons:

1. **Access Control Vulnerability in `missing` function**: The constructor function `missing` should have been named `Missing` (following Solidity's convention in older versions where the constructor name must match the contract name). Because of this incorrect name, the function is not treated as the constructor and can be called by anyone to reset the owner to their own address. This allows an attacker to take control of the contract, including withdrawing the contract's balance.

",1090,105,7.311899662017822
13,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the constructor function of the `Rubixi` contract. The function `DynamicPyramid()` on line 23 acts as the contract's constructor. However, in Solidity version 0.4.15, constructors must have the same name as the contract itself. Since the contract is named `Rubixi` but the constructor is named `DynamicPyramid`, this causes the function to be considered a regular public function instead of a constructor. 

This means **anyone can call the `DynamicPyramid()` function and set themselves as the `creator`,** bypassing access control checks meant to restrict certain actions to the contract creator only.",3010,139,10.79566502571106
14,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function of the `Wallet` contract. The line:

```solidity
require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);
```

should instead be:

```solidity
require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);
```

Currently, the condition allows withdrawals only when the requested amount is greater than or equal to the balance, which is incorrect. This can lead to users not being able to withdraw their funds unless they request an amount greater than or equal to their balance, which is clearly a logic flaw that can be exploited.",1207,111,8.624840021133423
15,access control,"YES. The vulnerability exists because the `IamMissing` function allows anyone to set themselves as the owner of the contract. This function is public, meaning any user can call it, effectively giving them ownership of the contract and enabling them to withdraw all the funds by calling the `withdraw` function.

16,access control,NO,1165,1,2.719013214111328
17,access control,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to the usage of `delegatecall` in the `Proxy` contract. Specifically, `delegatecall` is used in the `forward` function without proper restrictions or access controls. This allows any user to call arbitrary functions on the `callee` contract, potentially causing malicious actions or unauthorized state changes if the `callee` contract is not trusted or validated. This is an **access control** vulnerability as it allows anyone to execute code in the context of the `Proxy` contract, potentially exploiting the lack of protection on sensitive functionality.",1068,114,8.041906118392944
18,access control,"YES

The vulnerability in the `Wallet` contract lies in the **lack of access control** for the `PushBonusCode`, `PopBonusCode`, and `UpdateBonusCodeAt` functions. Any user can call these functions to modify the `bonusCodes` array, which should likely be restricted to only the contract owner. 

Additionally, the line `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length);` in the `PopBonusCode` function is a redundant check since `bonusCodes.length` is always non-negative (as it is an unsigned integer), and reducing the length without ensuring proper control could lead to unexpected behavior.

The `CustomToken` contract does not introduce additional access control issues based on the provided code snippet. However, the core vulnerability lies within the `Wallet` contract's public functions.",1261,161,9.376496076583862

The `Wallet` contract is vulnerable due to the public `initWallet` function. This allows anyone to call the function and become the `creator` of the contract, which grants them access to the privileged `migrateTo` function. Consequently, an attacker could reassign themselves as the `creator` and then transfer the entire balance of the contract to their own address using the `migrateTo` function. This is a clear access control vulnerability.",1225,93,8.122706413269043
21,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the use of `tx.origin` for access control in the `sendTo` function. Using `tx.origin` to validate the owner is insecure because it can be exploited in a phishing attack. If a contract calls this function on behalf of the owner, `tx.origin` will be the original sender of the transaction, not the immediate caller, which can bypass the intended access control. This makes the contract vulnerable to an attack where another contract tricks the owner into initiating a malicious transaction.",1057,103,6.87768292427063
22,access control,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable due to an access control issue. Specifically, the function `refund()` allows anyone to call it and withdraw their full balance without any restriction or validation beyond them having a balance. This opens the possibility for misuse, as users can continuously call the `refund()` function without additional security checks, potentially draining their own funds or misusing the function in an unintended way. Proper access control should be implemented to avoid unauthorized or improper use of the function.",1245,95,9.223754167556763
23,access control,"YES. The vulnerability in the given contract lies in the function `sudicideAnyone()`. This function allows any caller to trigger the `selfdestruct(msg.sender)`, which transfers the contract's remaining balance to the caller.

This is an access control vulnerability.",1016,83,5.718353033065796
24,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `changeOwner` function of the `Unprotected` contract. This function allows anyone to change the contract's owner without any access control mechanism like the `onlyowner` modifier.

25,access control,"YES

The vulnerability in the `Phishable` contract lies in the use of `tx.origin` for access control on line 20. This allows an attacker to perform a phishing attack by tricking the contract owner into interacting with a malicious contract, which then calls the `withdrawAll` function. The attack works because `tx.origin` refers to the original external account that initiated the transaction, and the malicious contract can pass this check, enabling the transfer of the contract's balance to an attacker-controlled address.",1075,102,7.599848508834839

It is vulnerable because the `delegatecall` function is used recklessly in the `FibonacciBalance` contract. Specifically, on lines 31 and 38:

1. **Line 31**: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(fibSig, withdrawalCounter));` - This delegates a call to an external contract (`fibonacciLibrary`) without proper access control, potentially allowing an attacker to execute malicious code and manipulate the contract's state.

2. **Line 38**: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(msg.data));` - This allows arbitrary code execution based on the data sent to the fallback function, which can be exploited by attackers to hijack the contract's logic.

137,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack through gas limits. Specifically, the issue is within the `ifillArray` function in the `DosOneFunc` contract:

- In the loop on line 17 (`for(uint i=0;i<350;i++)`), the function appends addresses to the `listAddresses` array.
- If the array size grows large enough (up to the limit of 1500 elements), calling this function may require more gas than is allowed in a single transaction.
- Eventually, the gas cost to process this function will exceed the block gas limit, causing a denial of service because the function will become uncallable when the gas limit is reached.

This makes the contract vulnerable to being frozen, preventing further interactions and causing a DoS condition.",1142,171,9.050164699554443
138,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the same issue: a potential denial of service (DoS) vulnerability in the `DosAuction` contract. Specifically, the line `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` can fail if the `currentFrontrunner` address is a contract that has a fallback function which deliberately fails or uses all gas. This would prevent further bids from being processed, resulting in a DoS attack.",1135,91,6.916369915008545
