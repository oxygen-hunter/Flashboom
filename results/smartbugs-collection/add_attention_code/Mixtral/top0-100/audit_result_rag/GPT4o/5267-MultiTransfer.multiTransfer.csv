11,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the **`newOwner`** function. Any user can call this function to add themselves as an owner or change the owner mappings arbitrarily. The function is marked as `external`, and it lacks proper access control checks, allowing unauthorized users to manipulate ownership records. This could lead to an attacker gaining unauthorized control of the contract by assigning themselves as an owner.

Additionally, in the **`deleteOwner`** function, the access control is inadequate since any owner can delete another owner's entry in the `owners` mapping, which might not be the desired behavior.",1247,122,7.73971962928772
12,access control,"YES. The vulnerability still exists in the `Missing` contract because the constructor function is named `missing` instead of `constructor`, making it callable like a regular function.

13,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the constructor function:

```solidity
function DynamicPyramid() {
    creator = msg.sender;
}
```

This function is written as a regular function rather than a constructor. In Solidity versions before 0.4.22, constructors needed to have the same name as the contract. However, since the contract's name has changed to ""Rubixi,"" this function is now a regular public function.

14,access control,"YES. 

The vulnerability is present in the `withdraw` function due to incorrect comparison logic in the `require` statement on line 16. The condition `require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);` is incorrect because it should instead check whether the `amount` requested for withdrawal is **less than or equal** to the user's balance. The correct condition would be `require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);`. This incorrect logic allows a user to potentially withdraw funds even if they don't have sufficient balance, leading to an access control issue.",1102,106,8.64312195777893

The vulnerability exists in the `IamMissing` function of the `Missing` contract. This function allows any user to call it and set themselves as the owner, effectively bypassing the intended access control.

18,access control,"YES. The contract is vulnerable due to the `PopBonusCode()` function. The condition `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length);` is redundant, as array lengths are always non-negative. This allows the function to reduce the array length without proper checks, potentially causing an underflow or unwanted behavior. Additionally, there is no access control in place to restrict who can call this function, meaning any external caller can modify the `bonusCodes` array.

Furthermore, the `multiTransfer` function in the `MultiTransfer` contract does not have any access control, allowing anyone to initiate token transfers, which could lead to unauthorized transfers from the token contract.",1156,131,7.969725131988525
19,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the constructor of the `Missing` contract. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, constructors must have the same name as the contract itself. However, the function `Constructor` does not match the contract's name, which means it is treated as a regular public function rather than a constructor. This allows anyone to call it and set themselves as the owner of the contract, leading to an access control vulnerability.",985,91,7.275038003921509
20,access control,"YES

The vulnerability in the `Wallet` contract remains. Specifically, the `initWallet` function (line 19) allows any user to call it, assigning themselves as the `creator`. This function does not have any access control measures, such as `require` conditions to restrict its usage. As a result, any malicious actor can become the `creator` and gain control over critical functions like `migrateTo`, which can transfer the contract's balance. This is a serious access control vulnerability.",1120,101,6.703157186508179
21,access control,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to the use of `tx.origin` in the `require` statement (line 20). This can be exploited through a phishing attack, where an attacker tricks the contract owner into executing a transaction that originates from the attacker's contract.

23,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `SimpleSuicide` contract. Specifically, in the function `sudicideAnyone()`, there is no access control mechanism to restrict who can call the function. This allows **anyone** to call the function and trigger `selfdestruct(msg.sender)`, resulting in the contract being destroyed and the remaining funds being sent to the caller (attacker).

In addition, the `MultiTransfer` contract does not have any direct vulnerability in terms of access control, but the focus here is on the `SimpleSuicide` contract, which exhibits the access control issue.",911,121,7.288770437240601
24,access control,"YES. The vulnerability in the provided smart contract lies in the `changeOwner` function, which allows anyone to change the owner of the contract without any access control.

25,access control,"YES

The vulnerability in the provided code lies in the use of `tx.origin` for access control in the `Phishable` contract. By relying on `tx.origin` in the `require(tx.origin == owner);` statement, the contract becomes susceptible to a phishing attack. An attacker can trick the contract owner into initiating a transaction from another contract, and the `tx.origin` would still be the owner's address, allowing the attacker to drain the contract's funds.

This is an access control vulnerability because it allows unauthorized users to bypass the intended restrictions and withdraw all the funds.",970,116,7.379649639129639
26,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The use of `delegatecall` on lines 31 and 38 creates a serious access control vulnerability. `delegatecall` allows the called contract (`fibonacciLibrary`) to execute code in the context of the calling contract (`FibonacciBalance`), which means the called contract can alter the state of the calling contract, including potentially sensitive data such as contract balance, without proper restrictions or validation. This opens the contract up to malicious manipulation, especially if the external library (`fibonacciLibrary`) is compromised or untrusted. Additionally, there is no access control mechanism in place to restrict who can call these functions, making it easier for an attacker to exploit the `delegatecall` mechanism.",1386,145,7.825558185577393

In both the `setReward()` and `claimReward()` functions, since the Ethereum blockchain is public, a malicious user can observe the transaction and submit a competing transaction with a higher gas fee, stealing the reward before the original transaction is processed.

The following lines are vulnerable to front-running:
- Line 23: `owner.transfer(reward);`
- Line 31: `msg.sender.transfer(reward);`

The vulnerability in the second contract lies in the `multiTransfer` function, which uses a `for` loop to iterate over an array of addresses and transfer tokens. The vulnerability is related to **gas limit exhaustion**. If the `_addresses` array is too large, the contract may run out of gas during execution, causing the transaction to fail. This type of vulnerability can lead to **denial of service** (DoS) for users with a large number of transfers in a single transaction.",869,106,8.104558229446411

Specifically, in `IntegerOverflowSingleTransaction`, integer overflows and underflows can occur due to the absence of overflow checks in operations like addition, multiplication, and subtraction. In the `MultiTransfer` contract, there is no check on the size of the array `_addresses`, which can potentially lead to gas limit issues, making it vulnerable to denial of service attacks.",1183,105,7.382518291473389
87,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

**Why it is vulnerable**: The vulnerability lies in the same part of the code as mentioned in the first `Token` contract. Specifically:

1. **Line 20 in the `Token` contract**: 
   ```solidity
   require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
   ```
   This line does not protect against integer underflows. In Solidity, `uint` is an unsigned integer, meaning it cannot represent negative values. If `balances[msg.sender] < _value`, then `balances[msg.sender] - _value` will cause an underflow, resulting in a very large value instead of a negative number. This can be exploited to steal tokens.

2. **Line 22 in the `Token` contract**:
   ```solidity
   balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
   ```
   Similar to the above, if an underflow occurs here, it will incorrectly increase `balances[msg.sender]`, leading to unintended behavior and potential exploitation.

These issues make the contract vulnerable to underflow attacks.",1080,221,10.403988122940063
88,arithmetic,"YES. 

The `IntegerOverflowAdd` contract is vulnerable to an arithmetic overflow, as explained in the previous case. Specifically, the line `count += input;` can result in an integer overflow if the input value is large enough. This vulnerability exists because Solidity versions below 0.8.0 do not automatically handle overflows.

Additionally, in the `MultiTransfer` contract, there is a potential issue related to the `for` loop iterating over an array. If the array `_addresses` is too large, it could lead to high gas consumption, which might cause the transaction to run out of gas. This would not be an arithmetic overflow vulnerability, but it can cause denial of service (DoS). However, this is not directly related to the `'arithmetic.sol'` vulnerability.",869,162,11.33330774307251
89,arithmetic,"YES

It is vulnerable because the `Overflow` contract in both cases contains an arithmetic operation (`sellerBalance += value;`) without protections against overflow. In Solidity versions below 0.8.0, unsigned integers can overflow, causing security risks such as incorrect balance updates. This could lead to the value wrapping around, potentially allowing an attacker to exploit this vulnerability by passing a large value to the `add()` function.

The `MultiTransfer` contract itself does not directly introduce overflow vulnerabilities but the mentioned vulnerability in the `Overflow` contract still applies.",886,110,40.90869641304016
90,arithmetic,"YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of arithmetic operations, specifically in the loop in the `multiTransfer` function. The vulnerability arises if the length of the `_addresses` array is very large, leading to an integer overflow when the loop variable `i` is incremented.

Thus, the contract is vulnerable due to predictable randomness.",2873,88,6.304924726486206
94,bad randomness,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `Lottery` contract, specifically in the `makeBet` function, where the outcome of the bet (`won`) is determined by the block number's modulus operation (`bool won = (block.number % 2) == 0;`).

95,bad randomness,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the same place as before: the randomness used in the `GuessTheRandomNumberChallenge` contract (line 15) is still insecure. The use of `block.blockhash(block.number - 1)` and `now` (which refers to the current block's timestamp) to generate the `answer` is predictable. Miners or attackers can influence the block timestamp or predict the blockhash and then guess the correct answer, leading to a successful exploit. Therefore, the contract is vulnerable to predictable randomness attacks.",1067,112,8.765939712524414
96,bad randomness,"YES. The vulnerability in the `RandomNumberGenerator` contract arises due to the reliance on predictable values such as `block.timestamp`, `block.number`, and `blockhash`, all of which can be manipulated or predicted by miners. Specifically:

- **Line 18**: `uint256 y = salt * block.number / (salt % 5);` combines `salt` and `block.number`, both of which can be controlled or predicted.
- **Line 20**: `uint256 seed = block.number / 3 + (salt % 300) + y;` further builds on these predictable values, leading to weak randomness.
- **Line 22**: `uint256 h = uint256(blockhash(seed));` uses `blockhash(seed)`, which only works for recent blocks, making it exploitable.",1118,194,10.586997985839844

This allows an attacker to reenter the contract, calling `Collect` repeatedly and draining funds before the balance is updated.",1564,74,5.860719442367554
122,reentrancy,"YES

The vulnerability exists due to the use of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `CashOut` function, which is a reentrancy vulnerability. This line allows an external contract to repeatedly call back into the `CashOut` function before the initial execution is complete, potentially draining the contract's balance.",1426,66,4.962578296661377
123,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because of the reentrancy attack present in the `Collect` function, specifically in this line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This low-level call does not properly manage reentrancy risks, allowing a malicious contract to repeatedly invoke the `Collect` function before the contract's state (i.e., the account balance) is updated. This can lead to draining of the contract's funds.",1522,94,8.895713567733765
124,reentrancy,"YES, the contract is vulnerable due to the reentrancy issue in the `CashOut` function, specifically at this line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This line uses a low-level call to send Ether to the `msg.sender`, which can potentially trigger reentrancy. Since the balance is updated only after the Ether is sent, an attacker could repeatedly call the `CashOut` function before the balance is updated, draining the contract's funds.",1412,100,6.23565936088562
125,reentrancy,"YES, the contract is vulnerable due to a reentrancy attack. The issue lies in the `Collect` function, where the statement `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())` transfers Ether to the caller before updating the balance. This allows an attacker to recursively call the `Collect` function and withdraw more funds than they should, draining the contract.",1566,72,4.609911203384399
126,reentrancy,"YES

The vulnerability exists in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract. The issue lies in the line where `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""");` is executed, allowing the caller's code to run before updating the contract's state (`userBalances[msg.sender] = 0`). This opens up the contract to a reentrancy attack, where an attacker could repeatedly call `withdrawBalance` before the balance is set to zero, draining the contract's funds.",1024,103,6.783259153366089
127,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` in the `TimedCrowdsale` contract. As explained earlier, the timestamp can be manipulated by miners to some extent, allowing them to affect the condition for determining whether the sale is finished. This reliance on `block.timestamp` makes the contract susceptible to time manipulation.",932,73,6.26102614402771
128,time manipulation,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to the use of `block.timestamp` (alias `now`) for critical logic in lines 13 and 27, which can be manipulated by miners. Additionally, using `block.timestamp` in the `randomGen` function for generating random numbers is insecure and can lead to exploitation, as miners have control over the timestamp value.",1167,74,5.931210279464722
129,time manipulation,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` in the `Governmental` contract. Specifically, the contract relies on `block.timestamp` to determine if enough time has passed before allowing the `resetInvestment()` function to proceed. Since `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners, this introduces a **time manipulation vulnerability**. The attacker can potentially influence the `block.timestamp` to trigger the reset earlier or later than expected.",1335,89,7.4895853996276855
130,time manipulation,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable to time manipulation. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the `require(now != pastBlockTime)` check and the use of `now % 15 == 0` in the `Roulette` contract. Since miners can manipulate the block timestamp, they could potentially control the outcome of the condition `now % 15 == 0`, leading to unfair advantages in the game and potential exploitation of the contract's balance transfer.",1034,91,6.795018911361694
131,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability in the `EtherLotto` contract comes from the line:

```solidity
var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;
```

This code relies on `block.timestamp` for generating randomness, which can be manipulated by miners. Miners have control over the block's timestamp within certain limits, allowing them to influence the outcome of the random number generation. This introduces a vulnerability to time manipulation, as the miner could adjust the timestamp to increase the likelihood of a favorable result, such as winning the pot.",1144,111,9.782102823257446
132,short addresses,"YES, it is vulnerable because the `multiTransfer` function in the `MultiTransfer` contract is susceptible to a ""short address attack."" This occurs when arguments (specifically addresses) are incorrectly padded, leading to improper transaction encoding. In this case, the array of addresses passed to the function could be manipulated, resulting in an unintended reduction in the number of bytes sent, which leads to misinterpretation of the following parameters (such as `amount`). This can cause loss of tokens or improper transfers.",1192,101,5.969972372055054
133,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `multiTransfer` function in the `MultiTransfer` contract. If the `_addresses` array is too large, this function could potentially run out of gas before completing, leading to a denial of service. Additionally, since there is no limit or gas control mechanism on the number of addresses being processed in the loop, it can consume excessive gas, making the function unusable in practice for large arrays. This makes it susceptible to a denial of service through gas exhaustion.",1160,100,7.840463399887085
134,denial of service,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. 

In the `DosNumber` contract, the vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, particularly due to the dynamic resizing of the array inside the loop. Each time the `array.length` is increased, it leads to potential gas limit issues, especially when the number of iterations (controlled by `numbers`) is large. This can result in a denial of service (DoS) attack, as transactions may run out of gas, preventing the function from executing properly.

In the `MultiTransfer` contract, there is also a potential vulnerability. The `multiTransfer` function performs a loop to transfer tokens to multiple addresses. If the `_addresses` array is very large, it can cause the contract to run out of gas, effectively leading to a DoS situation where transfers to other addresses fail.",1260,169,9.520289182662964
135,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability in the provided contract lies in the `MultiTransfer` contract. The for-loop in the `multiTransfer` function iterates over all addresses in the `_addresses` array. If the array is large, the gas required to process the loop could exceed the block gas limit, leading to a denial of service (DoS) attack by preventing the function from completing. This would make the contract unusable when the array grows too large.",2234,91,7.935359477996826
136,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));` line, as it can lead to a **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack. If one of the addresses in the `refundAddresses` list fails to accept the refund (e.g., due to the recipient’s fallback function using more than 2300 gas or being a contract designed to reject payments), the entire `refundAll()` function will revert, preventing any further refunds from being processed. This causes a situation where a single failure can block all subsequent refunds.",1143,125,8.324666261672974
137,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. 

In the `MultiTransfer` contract, the `multiTransfer` function iterates through an array of addresses without any gas limit or restriction on the array size. If `_addresses.length` is too large, the transaction could run out of gas and fail, resulting in a denial of service attack for users attempting to call this function with large arrays of addresses. This is a form of gas exhaustion, which can prevent the contract from executing properly, leading to denial of service.",1037,103,7.748127698898315
138,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability in the `DosAuction` contract lies in the same line as before:

```solidity
require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));
```

This line can cause a denial of service (DoS) because if the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract with a fallback function that consumes more gas than is available or is designed to reject payments, it would cause the bid function to fail. As a result, no further bids can be placed, and the auction would effectively be halted.
