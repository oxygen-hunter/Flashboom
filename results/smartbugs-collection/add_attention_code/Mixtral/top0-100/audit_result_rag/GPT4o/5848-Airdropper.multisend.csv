This can lead to a situation where the call fails silently without triggering a revert, which could result in loss of funds or incomplete transfers.

In addition, although the `Airdropper` contract uses a higher-level ERC20 `transfer` function, it doesn't inherently check the return value of the `transfer` function. In some ERC20 implementations, the `transfer` function might return a boolean value, and if that return value isn't checked, it could result in similar vulnerabilities.",1108,160,11.38906455039978

70,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the low-level call function in the `EBU` contract. Specifically, on the line:

```solidity
caddress.call(id, from, _tos[i], v[i]);
```

The `call` function does not check whether the call was successful or not. This can result in failures that are not properly handled. If the `call` returns `false`, the loop will continue, and the contract will not revert or stop execution, leading to potential loss of funds or logic failure. This unchecked call introduces a security risk, as external contract interactions may silently fail.",1114,129,9.59200930595398
71,unchecked low level calls,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the use of the low-level `call` function in the `sendMoney` function of the `SimpleWallet` contract:

72,unchecked low level calls,"YES. 

The contract contains a vulnerability related to unchecked low-level calls. Specifically, in the `Proxy` contract, the function `target.call.value(msg.value)(data)` makes a low-level call to `target` without checking the return value.

The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in the function `run(uint256 input)`. Specifically, the line `count -= input;` can result in an arithmetic underflow if the value of `input` exceeds the value of `count`.

1. In the `Token` contract's `transfer` function, line 20 contains `require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);`. This line is vulnerable to an underflow if `balances[msg.sender]` is less than `_value`, leading to a situation where `balances[msg.sender] - _value` wraps around and becomes a large number due to the way unsigned integers work in Solidity.
   
2. Line 22, `balances[msg.sender] -= _value;`, similarly performs a subtraction that could lead to an underflow if not properly handled.

88,arithmetic,"YES

The vulnerability in the given code lies in the loop in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. The issue is related to **gas limits**. The `while` loop iterates over the `dests` array and performs a token transfer for each address. If the `dests` array is very large, the function can exceed the block gas limit, resulting in a failure that could make the contract unusable. This makes it susceptible to **DoS (Denial of Service)** attacks when attempting to send tokens to too many addresses in one transaction.",926,123,6.949269771575928
89,arithmetic,"YES, it is vulnerable because the `multisend` function has the potential for an arithmetic overflow in the `value` parameter. Since Solidity versions prior to 0.8.x do not automatically check for overflows or underflows, if the `value` passed to the function is too large, it could cause an integer overflow, leading to unintended behavior in the contract. Specifically, the `i += 1;` and `value` could exceed their maximum values without any checks, potentially causing an overflow vulnerability.",943,105,6.922440052032471
90,arithmetic,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the same issue of integer overflow/underflow in the `multisend` function.

The vulnerability in the second smart contract code is due to the same issues present in the `RandomNumberGenerator` contract. Specifically:

1. **Line 12**: `uint256 private salt = block.timestamp;`
   - Using `block.timestamp` as a source of randomness makes the contract vulnerable because this value can be influenced by miners. Miners can control the timestamp within a small range, allowing them to potentially predict or manipulate the outcome.

2. **Line 18**: `uint256 y = salt * block.number / (salt % 5);`
   - Combining `block.timestamp` and `block.number` further compounds the predictability. Both of these values can be manipulated or known, allowing attackers to deduce the resulting ""random"" value.

3. **Line 20**: `uint256 seed = block.number / 3 + (salt % 300) + y;`
   - This relies on `block.number`, which is also a predictable value and can be easily replicated, thus weakening the randomness.

4. **Line 22**: `uint256 h = uint256(blockhash(seed));`
   - The `blockhash` function is only reliable for the most recent 256 blocks, and its usage here combined with the other predictable values makes it vulnerable to exploitation.

The reliance on `block.timestamp` allows miners to manipulate the timestamp, which could influence the outcome of the random number generation. This creates a vulnerability where a miner could predict or manipulate the result of the lottery game.",1201,82,6.259475231170654
132,short addresses,"YES

The contract is vulnerable to short address attacks. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs in the `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract. Short address attacks exploit how clients handle argument encoding, particularly when transferring tokens. If an attacker provides a short address (an incorrectly padded address), the EVM can incorrectly shift the argument values. This leads to unintended token transfers or contract behaviors. The vulnerability isn't within the EVM but rather in the client-side encoding and the interaction between the contract and clients. 

This should be mitigated in the contract to prevent exploitation.",1249,118,8.782338857650757
133,denial of service,NO,1217,1,2.277944564819336
134,denial of service,"YES. 

The vulnerability exists due to potential **Denial of Service (DoS)**, particularly in the `insertNnumbers` function. This vulnerability stems from the dynamic resizing of the array, which consumes a significant amount of gas, especially if the number of elements becomes large. Specifically:

1. **Line 20:** `array.length += 1;` resizes the array dynamically during each iteration. This process can become costly in terms of gas, especially if the array grows large.
2. **Line 22:** The loop continues assigning values to `array[numElements++]`, which adds to the gas cost with each new element added.

If the gas required to execute the function exceeds the block gas limit, it will fail, preventing further operations and leading to a potential **Denial of Service (DoS)** condition. This can prevent the contract from functioning properly, as users would not be able to execute the function once the gas limit is hit.",1317,194,11.75934362411499
135,denial of service,"YES. It is vulnerable due to a potential **denial of service (DoS)** attack in the **Government** contract at the following lines:

- Line 46: `creditorAddresses = new address ;`
- Line 48: `creditorAmounts = new uint ;`

The vulnerability arises when these arrays are cleared, potentially breaking the payment logic if the function tries to access invalid array indices. This can result in a contract state where no further actions can be taken, leading to a denial of service. Additionally, improper use of `send()` for transferring funds can fail silently, further exacerbating the issue.",2291,125,7.81184196472168
136,denial of service,"**YES**. The smart contract is vulnerable to a **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack. Specifically, the `refundAll()` function in the `Refunder` contract contains the same vulnerability you mentioned earlier: 

```solidity
require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));
```

This line can cause a DoS if any recipient fails to accept the funds, either due to gas limits or malicious behavior. If one address fails, the entire refund process will halt, preventing the other refunds from being processed.",1200,112,8.338523626327515
137,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. Specifically, the use of a `while` loop without a clear upper bound (it depends on the size of the `dests` array). This can cause a denial of service if the loop exceeds the gas limit, preventing the function from completing successfully.",1094,74,5.801880359649658
138,denial of service,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the same place as before, in line 23 of the `DosAuction` contract: `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));`. If the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract with a fallback function that consumes all the gas or purposely reverts, the `send()` operation will fail, resulting in a denial of service for future bidders since no one else will be able to take over as the frontrunner. This creates a situation where the contract gets stuck, preventing new bids from being placed.",1087,117,7.193006992340088
