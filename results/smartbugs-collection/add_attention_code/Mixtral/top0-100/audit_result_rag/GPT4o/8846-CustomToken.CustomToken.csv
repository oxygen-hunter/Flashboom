The vulnerability lies in the **`newOwner`** function in the **`MultiOwnable`** contract. It allows any external caller to assign themselves as the owner of any address without proper access control. Specifically, the **`newOwner`** function does not restrict who can call it, meaning any attacker can set themselves as an owner of the contract, bypassing access control mechanisms and potentially taking over the contract's functions.

Additionally, the **`deleteOwner`** function allows owners to delete other owners, and if the attacker becomes an owner, they can remove legitimate owners. This creates a severe security risk as unauthorized parties can gain control of the contract.",1343,142,9.622599363327026
12,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `missing` function, which is publicly accessible.

The vulnerability in the first smart contract lies in the **constructor** function, which is named `DynamicPyramid`. In Solidity versions prior to 0.4.22, a function with the same name as the contract is treated as the constructor. However, in this case, the contract's name is `Rubixi`, meaning the function `DynamicPyramid()` is a normal public function that can be called by anyone. This allows anyone to reset the `creator` address, which grants them access to the contract's privileged functions (protected by the `onlyowner` modifier). Therefore, this contract is vulnerable to an **access control** vulnerability.",3001,132,9.848438024520874

The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function of the `Wallet` contract. The `require` statement uses `amount >= balances[msg.sender]`, which is incorrect because it allows the withdrawal even if the requested amount is greater than the actual balance, leading to potential fund drainage. It should be `require(amount <= balances[msg.sender])` to prevent withdrawing more than the available balance. 

Additionally, in the `CustomToken` contract, the constructor is written incorrectly. The function should be `constructor` instead of `function CustomToken()` as per Solidity version 0.4.24.",1198,121,9.352910280227661

The vulnerability in the `MyContract` contract is due to the use of `tx.origin` for access control. When validating a caller in smart contracts, using `tx.origin` is unsafe because if another contract calls your contract on behalf of a malicious user, `tx.origin` will refer to the original external account that initiated the call, rather than the immediate caller. This can be exploited in a phishing-like attack pattern, where an attacker can trick the owner into interacting with a malicious contract that forwards the call to the vulnerable contract. In this case, the `require(tx.origin == owner);` check can be bypassed, allowing the attacker to call `sendTo` without being the owner. 

Therefore, the `MyContract` implementation should instead rely on `msg.sender` within its functions to ensure that access control only allows the immediate caller to be the owner.",1055,185,103.30037236213684

The vulnerability lies in the same section as before: 

```solidity

This code uses a low-level `call` function to send Ether, and the return value is not checked. If the `call` fails, the contract will continue execution without reverting, which could lead to the balance being reset to 0 even though the transfer was unsuccessful. This is a serious issue because the contract could lose track of the funds, leaving the user unable to withdraw their Ether.",1100,110,9.169817924499512
69,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The vulnerability exists in the `Command` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);
```

This is a low-level call that does not check the return value. If the `call` fails, it will return `false`, but the contract will continue execution without any error handling. This can lead to fail-open scenarios, where critical functions are assumed to have succeeded when they may have failed.

74,front running,"YES

The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in the same issue of **front-running** as described previously. Specifically, in the `FindThisHash` contract, line 17 still contains `require(hash == sha3(solution));`, which exposes the possibility of front-running. A malicious actor can observe the solution being revealed in a transaction and submit a duplicate transaction with higher gas fees to claim the reward first.

The added `CustomToken` contract does not directly introduce vulnerabilities related to this specific attack vector, but the original vulnerability from `FindThisHash` remains.",1142,113,6.449527978897095
75,front running,"YES

The vulnerability in this contract is related to front-running attacks, particularly in the `approve` function at line 110. The contract allows a spender to be approved for a certain amount of tokens without further checks for previously approved amounts. This can lead to a **race condition** where a malicious actor can execute transactions that approve the same spender multiple times, potentially allowing for unauthorized transfers of tokens. The function should be designed to prevent this by checking or reducing the current approval before allowing new approvals.",2216,100,5.77629280090332
76,front running,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability lies in the **`play` function** (lines 25 and 28) where a front-running attack is possible. Since the game logic is publicly visible on the Ethereum blockchain, a malicious user can monitor pending transactions, see a valid guess (number), and then submit a higher gas fee transaction to steal the win by front-running the original player.

85,arithmetic,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in this smart contract lies in the `count -= input;` line within the `run()` function, which can lead to an **arithmetic underflow**. Since the `count` is initialized to 1, if the `input` provided is greater than the current value of `count`, it will result in an underflow, causing `count` to wrap around and become a very large number instead of reducing to a negative value (since `uint256` is an unsigned integer). This behavior is the key issue and can lead to unexpected outcomes.",1035,120,8.329362869262695

The vulnerability lies in the following areas:
1. **Line 18 (`count += input;`)**: This is prone to integer overflow. If the `input` is large enough, the `count` can wrap around to a smaller value, causing unintended behavior.
2. **Line 24 (`count *= input;`)**: This is prone to integer overflow as well. Large multiplication values can exceed the maximum limit of the `uint` type, causing the result to wrap around.
3. **Line 30 (`count -= input;`)**: This is prone to integer underflow. If the `input` is greater than `count`, the subtraction will wrap around, leading to unexpected results.
4. **Line 36, 42, 48 (`uint res = count + input;`, `uint res = count * input;`, `uint res = count - input;`)**: These local operations can also result in integer overflow or underflow if the values involved exceed the `uint` type's limits.",1279,217,15.120392084121704

The contract is vulnerable due to potential arithmetic overflows and underflows in the `transfer` function of the `Token` contract. Specifically, the following issues exist:

1. **Line 20**: `require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);`
   - This line subtracts `_value` from `balances[msg.sender]` before the `require` check is applied. If `balances[msg.sender]` is less than `_value`, an integer underflow can occur, which can bypass the condition, leading to incorrect behavior.

2. **Line 22**: `balances[msg.sender] -= _value;`

88,arithmetic,"YES. The vulnerability is present in the `IntegerOverflowAdd` contract, particularly in the `run` function where the line `count += input;` can lead to an arithmetic overflow vulnerability. Since Solidity versions prior to 0.8.x do not have built-in protections against overflows and underflows, an attacker could input a value that causes `count` to exceed its maximum value (for a `uint` type), leading to unexpected behavior.",965,91,8.28781795501709
89,arithmetic,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the arithmetic operations within the first contract (`Overflow`). In the function `add(uint value)`, there is a potential for an integer overflow when adding `value` to `sellerBalance`. Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0 do not automatically check for overflows or underflows in arithmetic operations, so adding a large enough `value` can cause `sellerBalance` to wrap around and become a smaller value, leading to unintended behavior.",982,95,7.399816989898682

93,bad randomness,"YES

The vulnerability exists in the same part of the code as the previous example. The `rand` function relies on block properties like the previous block's hash and block number to generate randomness. These values can be manipulated or predicted by miners, which makes the randomness weak and predictable, allowing for potential exploitation. 

The vulnerable lines are:

1. **Line 127:** The `rand` function.
2. **Line 128:** Uses a constant factor based on the input `max`.
3. **Line 129-130:** Relies on the previous block's hash and block number for randomness, which can be influenced by miners.

2. Line 18: `uint256 y = salt * block.number / (salt % 5);` - The use of `block.number` also makes the result predictable, allowing malicious users to exploit this.
3. Line 20: `uint256 seed = block.number / 3 + (salt % 300) + y;` - This formula incorporates predictable values, reducing randomness.
4. Line 22: `uint256 h = uint256(blockhash(seed));` - The `blockhash` function only returns reliable results for recent blocks, further limiting the randomness and making the outcome easier to predict.

126,reentrancy,"YES. The `Reentrancy_insecure` contract in the provided code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack for the same reason as mentioned earlier. The vulnerability lies in the use of `call.value` to transfer funds before updating the user's balance, allowing an attacker to reenter the `withdrawBalance` function and repeatedly drain funds before the balance is updated.",1120,73,6.9574384689331055
127,time manipulation,"YES

The contract is vulnerable due to the use of `block.timestamp` in the `isSaleFinished` function. This allows for potential manipulation by miners, who can adjust the timestamp within a small range. As a result, they could affect the outcome of the sale period, possibly closing the sale early or keeping it open longer than intended, which introduces a time manipulation vulnerability.",1028,76,6.635900020599365
128,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the reliance on `block.timestamp` for randomness in line 27 of the `lottopollo` contract:

```solidity
return block.timestamp;   
```

Since miners have control over the timestamp, they can manipulate the outcome of the randomness generation, which can lead to predictable or biased results. This time manipulation makes the contract vulnerable. Additionally, the condition in the `payOut` function:

```solidity
if ( rand > 0 && now - rand > 24 hours )
```

is susceptible to the same vulnerability, as it depends on `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`). This can be exploited by miners, affecting the contract's behavior based on time.",1263,149,10.13372015953064
129,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` in the `Governmental` contract, specifically on line 27 where `lastInvestmentTimestamp` is set to `block.timestamp`. This makes the contract susceptible to time manipulation by miners, as they have some control over the exact timestamp used in the block. This vulnerability could be exploited in scenarios where the timing of investments or resets is crucial, as a miner could manipulate the `block.timestamp` to affect the contract's behavior.",1431,102,7.761928558349609
130,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the same time manipulation issue present in the `Roulette` contract. The use of `now` (an alias for `block.timestamp`) can be manipulated by miners, particularly in the line `require(now != pastBlockTime);`. This creates a vulnerability as the block timestamp can be influenced by miners, allowing potential manipulation of game outcomes.",1130,74,7.768711090087891
131,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` for generating randomness in the `EtherLotto` contract. Specifically, the line `var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;` allows miners to manipulate the block timestamp to influence the outcome of the random number generation. This is a well-known issue with using `block.timestamp` for randomness, as miners have some control over the block timestamp and can exploit this to their advantage.

The rest of the contract does not directly mitigate this vulnerability, so it remains a potential attack vector.",1240,120,8.757846593856812
132,short addresses,"YES. The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a short address attack, similar to the previous example. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the `sendCoin` function of the `MyToken` contract and any function in `CustomToken` that accepts address inputs. This type of vulnerability occurs when Ethereum clients do not properly validate the length of input addresses, allowing for the exploitation of incorrectly padded arguments. 

Although this is more of a client-side issue, it can be mitigated by adding proper input validation in the contract code itself.",1288,107,8.244145393371582
133,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability in the provided smart contract lies in the `emptyCreditors` function of the `DosGas` contract. Specifically, the large array `creditorAddresses` could lead to a denial of service (DoS) due to excessive gas consumption when trying to reset it with `creditorAddresses = new address ;` if its size exceeds a certain number (e.g., 1500 elements). This can cause the transaction to run out of gas, effectively preventing the function from being executed, thus causing a denial of service.",1256,109,8.886295080184937
134,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability in the provided contract is related to the `insertNnumbers` function. This function can cause a denial of service (DoS) by excessively increasing the gas required to process the loop when inserting a large number of elements. As the array dynamically increases in size (`array.length += 1`), the gas cost of resizing the array grows, potentially exceeding the block gas limit, thus making the function fail. This is a form of gas limit-based DoS vulnerability.

Additionally, the `clearDOS` function resets the array in a potentially costly operation. If the array is very large, reinitializing it to zero can also consume excessive gas, making the contract vulnerable to a denial of service due to running out of gas.",1356,150,11.99133825302124
135,denial of service,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to the potential for a **denial of service** (DoS) attack. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the following:

1. **Line 46**: `creditorAddresses = new address ;`
2. **Line 48**: `creditorAmounts = new uint ;`

In this case, if the contract cannot fully repay the creditor due to insufficient balance, the contract will revert or fail during execution when attempting to clear the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays. This can lead to a situation where further transactions fail, preventing any new creditors from interacting with the contract, effectively resulting in a denial of service.",2330,140,10.695592403411865
136,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll()` function, where it uses `send()` to transfer funds. The `send()` function in Solidity returns a boolean indicating success or failure, but if one of the transfers fails, the `require()` statement will revert the entire transaction. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) because if any recipient fails to accept the funds (e.g., their fallback function uses too much gas or throws an exception), the loop will stop, and no further refunds will be processed. This single point of failure can prevent the entire refund process.",1239,125,11.47698426246643
137,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability in the smart contract is in the `DosOneFunc` contract, particularly in the `ifillArray` function. The for-loop that pushes `msg.sender` into the `listAddresses` array can potentially cause a **denial of service** by consuming excessive gas. If the array size grows large enough (close to or exceeding the gas limit), it can prevent the function from executing successfully, making it vulnerable to a denial of service attack.",1133,94,8.013311862945557
