It is vulnerable because the `initWallet` function allows anyone to set themselves as the `creator` at any time, which compromises access control.

The vulnerability lies in the use of the low-level `call()` function on line 14 of the `Proxy` contract. This function does not automatically revert on failure and returns a boolean indicating success or failure. However, the return value is not checked, which can lead to potential security issues, such as failing to handle unsuccessful calls properly. This could allow attackers to exploit the contract by causing it to proceed with erroneous logic or fail silently without any corrective action.",1512,99,10.553025960922241
73,front running,"YES. The contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks.

The vulnerability occurs due to the public visibility of transactions in Ethereum, which allows malicious users to observe pending transactions and submit a similar transaction with a higher gas fee to front-run the original one. Specifically:

1. **Line 23**: `owner.transfer(reward);` in `setReward()` exposes the contract to front-running because a malicious user can observe the setting of the reward and submit a higher-fee transaction to claim the reward before the original transaction completes.
2. **Line 31**: `msg.sender.transfer(reward);` in `claimReward()` also exposes the contract to front-running, as an attacker can front-run the claim process by observing the original claimant's transaction and submitting their own with higher gas fees.",1337,159,10.336393117904663
74,front running,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because the `solve` function in the `FindThisHash` contract uses `sha3(solution)` to verify the solution, allowing for front-running attacks.

75,front running,"YES

The contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks. Specifically, the `approve` function in the ERC20 contract allows users to change the allowance without any protection against race conditions.

The vulnerability lies in the `rand` function, which generates randomness based on the block's hash and block number.

Both `blockhash` and `now` are predictable by miners, making the generated ""random"" value susceptible to manipulation. This allows attackers to predict the value of `answer` and correctly guess it, thereby exploiting the contract to win 2 ether.

The smart contract is vulnerable due to its use of block attributes for randomness, which are predictable and can be influenced by miners. Specifically, the vulnerabilities are:
