This can result in unauthorized individuals draining the contract's balance. Additionally, the contract lacks safeguards like `onlyowner` or similar mechanisms to restrict access to this critical function.",1173,81,5.379140138626099
13,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

It has an access control issue with the constructor function `DynamicPyramid`. Since Solidity version 0.4.15 does not require the `constructor` keyword, the function `DynamicPyramid` can be called by anyone, allowing any user to become the contract's owner (i.e., assign themselves as the `creator`). This is the same issue present in the earlier contract, allowing unauthorized access to the contract's ownership and control mechanisms.",3093,96,7.412031888961792

If any of the addresses in the `devs` or `smallerdevs` array is a contract that reverts or consumes excessive gas, it can prevent the rest of the `payout()` function from completing, leading to a denial of service. Additionally, the `transfer()` function can fail if the recipient contracts do not handle the received funds properly, further causing the contract to be stuck in a vulnerable state.",1447,105,10.364803314208984
135,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `payout` function. It can cause a denial of service due to the use of `transfer` within a loop. If any of the `devs` or `smallerdevs` addresses are contracts that have a fallback function consuming more than 2300 gas, the `transfer` will fail, which would prevent the entire `payout` function from completing successfully. This would block any subsequent calls to `payout`, effectively causing a denial of service.",2421,102,11.017243146896362

137,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability lies in the `payout()` function, specifically in the use of `transfer()`. If any of the addresses (either in `devs` or `smallerdevs`) is a contract, and that contract's fallback function consumes more gas than allowed by the `transfer` function, the whole `payout()` function will fail. This can result in a denial of service, preventing the function from completing and blocking further payouts. Additionally, this vulnerability can also be exploited if a contract maliciously consumes all the gas, leading to a complete halt in the execution of the `payout()` function.",1224,133,8.935875415802002
138,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability in this contract lies in the `payout()` function. Specifically, the `transfer()` function, like `send()`, can fail if the recipient is a contract with a fallback function that consumes more than 2300 gas, which leads to a denial of service (DoS). If one of the addresses in the `devs` or `smallerdevs` array cannot accept the transfer, the entire payout process will revert, making it impossible to complete. This creates a potential denial of service situation, preventing any further payouts or bids.",1218,114,7.504763603210449
