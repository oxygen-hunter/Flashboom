The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function of the `MultiOwnable` contract, where it allows any external caller to assign themselves as the owner of any other address by calling this function. This creates an access control issue, as malicious actors can add themselves as an owner, thereby gaining unauthorized control of contract functions restricted to owners.",1276,70,4.795775413513184
12,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `function missing()` of the `Missing` contract. This function allows anyone to call it and set themselves as the contract's `owner`. There is no access control on this function, meaning any malicious user can take control of the contract and withdraw its funds via the `withdraw()` function, as the `onlyowner` modifier will then validate them as the new `owner`. This is an ""access control"" vulnerability.",1014,95,11.558864116668701
13,access control,"YES. It is vulnerable because the constructor function `DynamicPyramid()` does not follow Solidity's updated constructor syntax. In Solidity versions prior to 0.4.22, constructors use the function name identical to the contract name. Here, anyone can call `DynamicPyramid()` and set themselves as the `creator`, bypassing the access control intended for the contract, allowing unauthorized users to control critical functions restricted by the `onlyowner` modifier.",2934,90,7.031786203384399
14,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function of the `Wallet` contract. The condition `require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);` should be `require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);`. Additionally, the `MultiTransfer` contract can potentially introduce issues with access control, as it allows any user to invoke the `transfer` function, which could lead to unauthorized transfers if not properly restricted.",1131,80,9.464158296585083
15,access control,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable due to improper access control. The `IamMissing` function allows anyone to set themselves as the owner, as it is marked `public` and lacks access restrictions. This means any user can call this function and take ownership of the contract. Consequently, they can withdraw all funds using the `withdraw` function, which only checks for `msg.sender == owner`.

Additionally, in the `MultiTransfer` contract, there is no proper access control mechanism to restrict who can call the `transfer` function, making it possible for unauthorized users to potentially misuse the transfer functionality if they gain control over a valid token. This lack of restrictions makes the contract highly susceptible to exploitation.",1024,140,6.084421634674072
16,access control,"YES

The vulnerability in the original contract lies in the fact that the `set` function does not include proper access control. It is a public function, which means any user can call it and modify the contents of the `map` array. This enables anyone to potentially set arbitrary values in the contract, including malicious actors.

Although the `withdraw` function includes access control (`require(msg.sender == owner)`), there is no access control in the `set` function, which exposes the contract to unauthorized access. Any user can manipulate the `map` array, and this could be exploited to change data in the contract.

The vulnerability is present in the lack of access control on the `set` function, and this issue is not mitigated by the presence of the `withdraw` function's control.",1089,160,4.816517114639282
17,access control,"YES

The contract is vulnerable because it uses `delegatecall` in the `Proxy` contract, which can lead to access control issues. Specifically, `delegatecall` executes code in the context of the calling contract, which could allow the called contract (callee) to execute malicious logic or manipulate the state of the `Proxy` contract.

18,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `MultiTransfer` contract, specifically in the absence of access control for the `transfer` function. Anyone can call this function to execute transfers on behalf of the `owner`, as long as the `ERC20` token allows it. This lack of access control can allow unauthorized users to perform arbitrary transfers, leading to potential fund losses.

19,access control,"YES, the vulnerability in the first contract is still present. The constructor function is incorrectly named ""Constructor"" with an uppercase ""C"", but in Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, constructor functions must match the contract name exactly (case-sensitive) or be named ""constructor"" (lowercase). This mistake makes the function a regular public function, which allows anyone to call it and take ownership of the contract, leading to an access control vulnerability.",1014,92,6.9121081829071045
20,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `initWallet()` function in both smart contract codes. This function allows anyone to call it and set themselves as the creator of the wallet. Since `initWallet()` is a public function, it can be called multiple times, and any user can become the creator after deployment. This creates an access control vulnerability, as the `migrateTo()` function only checks if `msg.sender` is the creator. Once someone else calls `initWallet()` and sets themselves as the creator, they can call `migrateTo()` and transfer the entire balance of the contract.",1149,126,10.416098833084106

This can bypass the intended security check, allowing an attacker to execute the `sendTo` function. Instead of `tx.origin`, the contract should use `msg.sender` for proper access control.",981,110,8.585984230041504

23,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `SimpleSuicide` contract, which has an insecure function `sudicideAnyone()` that allows anyone to trigger `selfdestruct(msg.sender)`. This means that any user can call this function, and the contract will self-destruct, sending all its balance to the caller. 

This is a serious access control vulnerability because the contract has no access restrictions on the `sudicideAnyone` function. As a result, any user can destroy the contract and withdraw its funds.

",940,104,5.346571207046509

The vulnerability exists due to the use of `delegatecall` in both the `withdraw` function (line 31) and the fallback function (line 38) without proper access control. This allows an attacker to manipulate the logic of the `FibonacciBalance` contract by supplying their own malicious contract as the `fibonacciLibrary`. The malicious contract could execute arbitrary code or access critical data, leading to an access control breach.

The smart contract is vulnerable for the following reasons:

1. **Unchecked Low-Level Call**: In the `go()` function, the line `target.call.value(msg.value)();` is a low-level call, and it does not check the return value of the call. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the external contract fails or behaves incorrectly. If the call fails, the contract continues execution without proper handling or rollback of state changes, which is a potential vulnerability.

2. **Reentrancy Risk**: The contract first sends funds using a low-level call and then transfers the remaining balance to the owner. This flow can lead to a reentrancy vulnerability, where the target contract could call back into the contract before the state is updated, potentially draining the contract's funds.

3. **Use of `.transfer` in an Unsafe Context**: While `owner.transfer(address(this).balance);` seems to transfer funds to the owner, it could still be exploited in a contract with a reentrancy attack due to the earlier low-level call and potential failure to properly secure funds.

The contract lacks proper error checking, security measures, and fail-safes, which makes it vulnerable to common attacks such as reentrancy and unchecked low-level calls.",1063,254,4.366276025772095

Since each transfer happens sequentially in a for loop, the order of execution can be manipulated, allowing malicious actors to exploit the transaction timing.",1129,136,9.943647861480713
74,front running,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability still lies in the `FindThisHash` contract due to the same front-running risk. Specifically, in the `solve` function, where the solution to the hash is revealed in the transaction before it is mined. This allows a malicious user to observe the pending transaction, copy the solution, and submit a transaction with a higher gas fee to preempt the original user's transaction and claim the reward first.

This issue is referred to as a ""front-running"" attack, where attackers exploit the transparency of the blockchain to submit a better or faster transaction.",1075,118,8.515592813491821

The smart contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks. Specifically, the `MultiTransfer` contract allows multiple transfers to be executed in a single transaction, using the `transferFrom` function. A malicious actor can observe the pending transaction and, knowing the intended transfers, can create a competing transaction with a higher gas fee, front-running the original one. Since the Ethereum blockchain is public, the attacker can essentially hijack the process before the legitimate transaction is confirmed.

The vulnerability is due to the potential for integer overflow and underflow in the `TokenSaleChallenge` contract. Specifically:

- **Line 23**: `require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);` could result in an overflow if `numTokens` is large enough. In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, multiplication of large integers could cause overflows, leading to incorrect validation of the required amount of Ether sent.
  
- **Line 25**: `balanceOf[msg.sender] += numTokens;` can cause an overflow if `numTokens` is large enough, allowing attackers to increase their balance beyond the intended limit.
  
- **Line 33**: `msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);` is vulnerable to overflow if the multiplication of `numTokens` and `PRICE_PER_TOKEN` exceeds the limit for unsigned integers.

Explanation:
In the `run` function of the `IntegerOverflowMultiTxOneFuncFeasible` contract, the line `count -= input;` subtracts the `input` value from `count`. Since `count` starts at 1, if `input` is greater than or equal to 1, this could cause an integer underflow (since `uint256` is an unsigned integer and cannot hold negative values). This would result in `count` wrapping around to a very large number (due to underflow), which can be exploited.",968,131,8.920964002609253
86,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the arithmetic operations in the `IntegerOverflowSingleTransaction` contract, as identified in the previous explanation. Specifically, the operations in lines 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, and 48 can result in integer overflows or underflows in Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, which do not include built-in protections for these issues. 

Additionally, the `MultiTransfer` contract also lacks checks for safe arithmetic operations in the loop, potentially allowing overflows. However, the primary vulnerability type is still 'arithmetic.sol' from the earlier part of the code.",1212,134,11.682808876037598
87,arithmetic,"YES. The smart contract code is vulnerable due to potential arithmetic underflows, specifically in the `Token` contract's `transfer` function on lines 20 and 22. The statement `require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0)` does not properly prevent underflows when `_value` is greater than `balances[msg.sender]`. This condition allows the balance to wrap around to a very large value, bypassing the check and potentially enabling malicious behavior. Additionally, `balances[msg.sender] -= _value;` could result in underflows for similar reasons.",1109,116,8.442427635192871
88,arithmetic,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `IntegerOverflowAdd` contract, specifically in the line `count += input;`. In Solidity version 0.4.19, arithmetic operations are not checked for overflows or underflows. If `input` is large enough, adding it to `count` could cause an overflow, resulting in `count` wrapping around to a much smaller value, which can be exploited.

Additionally, in the `MultiTransfer` contract, there is a potential issue related to unchecked arithmetic when iterating through the `to` and `value` arrays, which could also lead to vulnerabilities under certain conditions. However, the primary focus here is on the arithmetic overflow in the `IntegerOverflowAdd` contract.",898,146,11.459938049316406
89,arithmetic,"YES, the code is vulnerable.

In the first contract `Overflow`, there is a potential for an integer overflow in the line:
```solidity

```
This is because Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0 do not automatically check for overflows or underflows in arithmetic operations, which could allow an attacker to exploit this and manipulate the balance.

In the second contract `MultiTransfer`, although there is no direct arithmetic operation, if the `value[i]` being transferred in the loop is large enough to cause an overflow, it could also lead to similar issues when interacting with ERC20 tokens that do not correctly handle overflows/underflows.

This uses the `blockhash()` function to determine the outcome of the guess, which relies on the block hash of a specific block. However, block hashes for recent blocks are predictable or manipulable by miners, allowing them to influence the outcome, thus compromising the randomness.

In both cases, the operations within the loops (growing the array and calling `transferFrom` for each recipient) can consume excessive gas if the arrays are too large, potentially leading to the contract failing to execute due to gas limits. This can render the contract unusable for large transactions, effectively creating a denial of service condition.",1289,120,7.757105112075806
135,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `MultiTransfer` contract. Specifically, the loop in the `transfer` function could be exploited to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by artificially inflating the number of `to` addresses or `value` entries, resulting in high gas costs. If the gas required exceeds the block gas limit, the transaction will fail, preventing any transfers from occurring. This is a classic ""gas limit"" DoS attack.",2263,93,6.991598606109619

138,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` line of the `DosAuction` contract. This can potentially lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack if the `send` function fails. If the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract with a fallback function that consumes more than 2300 gas, the `send` will fail, preventing any further bids from being processed. Thus, the contract becomes unusable for others, effectively causing a DoS.",1059,106,9.628839015960693
