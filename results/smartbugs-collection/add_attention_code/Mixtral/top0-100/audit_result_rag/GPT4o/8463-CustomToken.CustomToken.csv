The vulnerability in the first smart contract lies in the constructor function, which is named `DynamicPyramid()` instead of matching the contract name, `Rubixi`. In Solidity version 0.4.15, if the constructor function does not match the contract name, it becomes a regular public function. This allows anyone to call the `DynamicPyramid()` function and reassign the `creator` variable, taking ownership of the contract. This leads to an access control vulnerability.

The second contract does not appear to exhibit the same issue.",2969,109,8.979393720626831
14,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because in the `withdraw` function, the requirement `require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);` should actually be `require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);`.

16,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in the `Map` contract lies in its **access control**. Specifically, the `set` function allows *any user* to modify the contents of the `map` array. This should be restricted, as it can enable unauthorized users to change critical data.

Additionally, in the `CustomToken` contract, the constructor function is defined incorrectly using `function CustomToken() public` instead of the correct `constructor() public`.

- Additionally, the **CustomToken** contract also has an issue in its constructor, as it does not include any proper access control for minting tokens, potentially allowing unintended behavior.

94,bad randomness,"YES

The first smart contract `Lottery` is vulnerable due to the use of block properties (`block.number % 2`) to determine the outcome of a bet. This is a form of poor randomness generation. Block numbers are predictable and can be influenced by miners, which makes it possible for malicious actors to manipulate the outcome of the lottery. This type of vulnerability is classified as ""bad randomness."" 

In line 38:
```solidity
bool won = (block.number % 2) == 0;
```
Using `block.number` to generate randomness allows for prediction or manipulation of the outcome by miners, as block numbers are deterministic.",1367,130,8.486125707626343
95,bad randomness,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `GuessTheRandomNumberChallenge` contract, specifically in the line where the randomness is generated:

```solidity
answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));
```

This is vulnerable because:
1. **Predictability of `block.blockhash`**: The `block.blockhash` of a recent block (like `block.number - 1`) can be known or manipulated by miners, making it predictable.
2. **Predictability of `now` (timestamp)**: The `now` (or `block.timestamp`) can be influenced by miners within a small range, adding to the vulnerability.
   
Together, these factors make the random number generation weak and subject to prediction or manipulation, which can allow an attacker to guess the correct number and drain the contract.",1131,177,10.757085800170898
96,bad randomness,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability stems from the same issues with randomness as the previous code, particularly in lines:

- Line 12: `uint256 private salt = block.timestamp;` - Block timestamp is predictable and can be influenced by miners.
- Line 18: `uint256 y = salt * block.number / (salt % 5);` - The calculation uses predictable block numbers.
- Line 20: `uint256 seed = block.number / 3 + (salt % 300) + y;` - Block numbers and timestamps are not secure sources of randomness.
- Line 22: `uint256 h = uint256(blockhash(seed));` - Blockhash values for recent blocks are predictable.

128,time manipulation,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to time manipulation due to the use of `block.timestamp` (or `now`) in the `randomGen` function and the conditional check in `payOut`. Miners can manipulate `block.timestamp` to influence the outcome of the contract, which can lead to exploitation in time-dependent logic, such as in the payout condition on line 13 (`if ( rand> 0 && now - rand > 24 hours )`). This introduces a potential for manipulating the randomness and timing in the contract.",1231,107,7.480677604675293
129,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability arises from the reliance on `block.timestamp` in the `resetInvestment` function, specifically in this line:

```solidity

This allows miners to manipulate the timestamp and potentially exploit the contract by delaying or advancing the execution of certain functions, creating a situation where they could trigger the `resetInvestment` function under advantageous conditions.",1399,90,7.085359811782837

The `Roulette` contract is vulnerable due to its reliance on `now`, which is manipulable by miners, specifically in line 18: `require(now != pastBlockTime);` and line 20: `pastBlockTime = now;`. This time manipulation vulnerability allows miners to influence the outcome of the `now % 15 == 0` condition, which could result in the contract being exploited to drain its balance.
