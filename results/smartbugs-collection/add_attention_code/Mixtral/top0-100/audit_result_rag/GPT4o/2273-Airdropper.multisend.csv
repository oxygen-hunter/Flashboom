11,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function of the `MultiOwnable` contract, which allows any external caller to add themselves or another address as an owner without proper access control. Specifically, any user can call `newOwner` and set themselves as the owner by providing their address, leading to unauthorized ownership assignment. This is an access control issue.",1308,78,6.854460716247559
12,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `missing()` function of the `Missing` contract. This function is public and can be called by anyone, allowing any caller to overwrite the `owner` variable and take control of the contract. This means that anyone can become the owner and gain access to the `withdraw()` function, which allows them to drain the contract's balance.

The vulnerability type is related to improper **access control**.",1046,92,8.270947694778442
13,access control,"YES. The vulnerability exists because the constructor function `DynamicPyramid` does not use the `constructor` keyword, allowing anyone to call it and become the contract's owner by setting `creator = msg.sender`. This access control issue allows unauthorized users to take control of the contract.",2966,56,5.88507866859436
14,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the following:

1. In the `Wallet` contract's `withdraw` function, the line `require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);` should be `require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);`. This mistake allows users to withdraw more than their balance, which is an access control vulnerability.
   
2. In the `Airdropper` contract, while the `onlyOwner` modifier protects the `multisend` function, there is no protection against reentrancy attacks during the `ERC20.transfer()` call. This could lead to unauthorized multiple transfers, causing a loss of tokens.",1163,127,8.246735572814941
15,access control,"YES. The vulnerability in the contract lies in the **`IamMissing`** function, which allows anyone to call it and become the owner of the contract. This is an access control vulnerability because the ownership should be assigned only once during contract deployment or restricted to authorized users. As it stands, any external user can call **`IamMissing`** and take control of the contract, leading to unauthorized access to critical functions like **`withdraw`**.",1056,91,6.590266942977905
16,access control,NO,1121,1,3.512721538543701
17,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable because the `Proxy` contract uses `delegatecall` in the `forward` function, which can execute code in the context of the calling contract. This could lead to access control vulnerabilities if untrusted contracts are called. Additionally, the `Airdropper` contract inherits from `Ownable`, but since the `Proxy` contract doesn't restrict who can call the `forward` function, it can be exploited by unauthorized users to manipulate the contract.",1024,95,5.49631929397583
18,access control,"YES, the vulnerability in the `Airdropper` contract lies in the lack of checks for the length of the `dests` and `values` arrays in the `multisend` function. If the two arrays have different lengths, this could lead to errors or unexpected behavior during token transfers. Additionally, the loop in the `multisend` function could run out of gas for large arrays, making the transaction fail.

Furthermore, the `onlyOwner` modifier restricts function access to the contract owner but doesn't provide any additional protection from reentrancy or other possible attacks on the transfer logic itself.",1217,124,18.452022552490234
19,access control,"YES. The vulnerability in the `Missing` contract lies in the incorrect constructor definition. The function `Constructor()` is supposed to be the constructor, but due to the capitalization and Solidity's case-sensitive nature, it is considered a regular function. As a result, the `owner` variable is never initialized, allowing anyone to call the `withdraw` function and transfer the contract's balance to themselves.

This access control issue occurs because there is no mechanism to set the `owner` in the actual constructor, making it easy for attackers to exploit the contract and drain its funds.",1046,114,7.744221448898315
20,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `initWallet` function in both the first and second smart contracts. The function allows anyone to call it because it is marked as `public`. This means any user can set themselves as the `creator`, giving them unauthorized access to functions that require `creator` privileges, such as `migrateTo`. This creates an access control vulnerability since the creator's privileges can be overridden by any caller.",1181,92,8.188151121139526
21,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the line `require(tx.origin == owner);`. Using `tx.origin` for access control is insecure because it can be exploited in a phishing attack where a malicious contract can trick the owner into calling the function indirectly, thus bypassing the intended access control.",1013,57,5.345227479934692
22,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable due to the lack of access control in the `refund()` function. Any user can call this function and withdraw their full balance without any restriction, which could be exploited. The absence of proper access control checks in the `refund()` function makes it susceptible to abuse.",1201,59,7.754670143127441
23,access control,"YES. The contract is vulnerable due to improper access control in the `SimpleSuicide` contract. Specifically, the function `sudicideAnyone()` allows **anyone** to call `selfdestruct`, which will send all the contractâ€™s funds to the caller (`msg.sender`).

24,access control,"YES. The vulnerability in the given smart contract code lies in the `changeOwner` function within the `Unprotected` contract. This function allows anyone to change the owner of the contract without any access control. The `onlyowner` modifier is defined but not used in the `changeOwner` function, which means there is no restriction on who can call this function, allowing unauthorized users to take control of the contract.",1053,84,5.67232346534729
25,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the use of `tx.origin` in the `Phishable` contract to validate the owner. This can be exploited by a phishing attack where an attacker tricks the owner into interacting with a malicious contract, allowing the attacker to withdraw funds.

26,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the use of `delegatecall` in the `FibonacciBalance` contract on lines 31 and 38. Specifically, `delegatecall` executes code in the context of the calling contract, meaning that if the `fibonacciLibrary` address is compromised or set to a malicious contract, it can execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the `FibonacciBalance` contract. This can allow an attacker to manipulate the contract's state or drain funds.

Additionally, the `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract lacks checks for array length matching between `dests` and `values`, which can cause logical issues or unintended behavior.",1447,138,7.912739276885986

2. **Line 97**: `_addr.call.value(_wei);`
   - Similar to the first case, this `call()` to transfer Ether does not check the return value, which can lead to silent failures in sending Ether to `_addr`, creating a vulnerability for funds being stuck or not transferred as intended.

83,arithmetic,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in the first part of the code is related to the `count -= input;` operation, where an arithmetic underflow can occur. Since `count` is initialized to 1 and is an unsigned integer (`uint256`), subtracting a larger `input` from `count` can result in an underflow, leading to unintended behavior.

86,arithmetic,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable due to potential arithmetic overflows and underflows in the `IntegerOverflowSingleTransaction` contract. Specifically:

1. **Line 18: `count += input;`** can lead to an overflow if the value of `input` causes the total value of `count` to exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a `uint` (2^256 - 1).
2. **Line 24: `count *= input;`** can result in an overflow if the multiplication results in a value larger than the `uint` type can hold.
3. **Line 30: `count -= input;`** can lead to an underflow if `input` is larger than the current value of `count`, which could result in `count` wrapping around to a very large value due to the underflow behavior of `uint`.
4. **Line 36: `uint res = count + input;`** is also vulnerable to overflow, though it only affects the local variable `res`.
5. **Line 42: `uint res = count * input;`** similarly has an overflow risk, even though it only affects `res`.
6. **Line 48: `uint res = count - input;`** is vulnerable to underflow, affecting `res`.

These vulnerabilities arise from Solidity version 0.4.23, which does not include built-in checks for overflows and underflows. To mitigate these, the contract should use the `SafeMath` library or upgrade to Solidity 0.8.0+, where such arithmetic errors are automatically checked.",1244,329,17.860782861709595

The vulnerability exists due to potential integer overflow/underflow issues in the `Token` contract. Specifically, in the lines:

- `require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);` (line 20) â€” Subtraction before the check can lead to an underflow if `_value` is greater than `balances[msg.sender]`.
- `balances[msg.sender] -= _value;` (line 22) â€” This line will also be vulnerable to underflow, which can result in unintended behavior, such as negative balances wrapping around to large numbers due to the nature of unsigned integers in Solidity versions prior to 0.8.

In Solidity versions before 0.8, arithmetic operations like subtraction do not automatically revert on overflow or underflow.",1141,157,11.76423454284668

The given smart contract contains a vulnerability related to randomness, similar to the one described in the initial contract. Specifically, the `rand()` function relies on the `block.blockhash()` of the previous block (`lastBlockNumber = block.number - 1`). This makes the randomness predictable and subject to manipulation by miners, who can influence the outcome by selectively choosing which transactions to include. Thus, the `rand()` function's use in selecting entries for payout (`uint index = unpaidEntries.length > 1 ? rand(unpaidEntries.length) : 0`) is insecure and can be exploited.",2934,120,4.87474799156189

2. **Line 18**: `uint256 y = salt * block.number / (salt % 5);` â€“ Block numbers and salts based on timestamps are predictable and susceptible to exploitation.
3. **Line 20**: `uint256 seed = block.number / 3 + (salt % 300) + y;` â€“ Again, predictable block numbers combined with a weak salt lead to predictable seeds.

If the `dests` array is too large, it can cause the function to exceed the gas limit, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) for the transaction. This would prevent the function from completing and cause it to fail repeatedly.",1098,79,7.258232831954956
138,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the same part of the code: `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));`. This line uses the `send` function to transfer funds to the current frontrunner, which can fail if the recipient is a contract that consumes too much gas in its fallback function, leading to a denial of service. As a result, the `bid` function can get stuck, preventing future bidders from participating.",1091,95,9.300362825393677
