12,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is related to **access control** in the `Missing` contract. The constructor function `missing()` should be a proper constructor in older versions of Solidity (before version 0.4.22). However, due to the incorrect naming convention (using `missing()` instead of `constructor`), the `missing()` function can be called by anyone, allowing them to take ownership of the contract. This means anyone can set themselves as the owner, bypassing access controls.",1049,103,6.537952661514282
13,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the constructor function, which is incorrectly named `DynamicPyramid()` instead of following the constructor naming convention of Solidity versions before 0.4.22. This allows any user to call this function and become the contract owner, as `creator = msg.sender;` assigns the caller's address as the new owner. This is an access control issue.",2969,76,5.736260652542114

The vulnerability lies in the function `withdraw` in the `Wallet` contract, where the line:

```solidity

15,access control,"YES

The vulnerability in the smart contract arises from the `IamMissing` function in the `Missing` contract.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` constructor. The initial supply of tokens is assigned entirely to a single hardcoded address (`0x178f97a55b02eead22b895e6525de97689dd05e9`). This is an **access control issue**, as the contract does not restrict or provide flexibility for token distribution. If the owner's private key for this address is compromised, all tokens can be stolen. This centralizes control of the token, which is a major risk in terms of access control.",1124,111,6.916597843170166
17,access control,"YES, the smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability stems from the use of the `delegatecall` in the `forward` function of the `Proxy` contract, similar to the original code provided. The `delegatecall` can lead to access control issues if the caller is not properly validated. Since the `forward` function is marked as `public`, any user can call it and the contract will execute the code located at the `callee` address in the context of the `Proxy` contract.

This type of unchecked low-level call is prone to security risks, such as fail-opens or unintended behavior, making the contract vulnerable.",1121,125,8.834870338439941
71,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `sendMoney` function of the `SimpleWallet` contract. The low-level function `_target.call.value(_value)()` is used, but the return value of this call is not checked. This is dangerous because if the call fails, the contract will not revert, leading to potential loss of funds or unintended behavior. Proper error handling should be implemented by checking the return value of the call, as low-level calls do not automatically propagate failures.",1169,96,6.606707334518433
72,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The vulnerability exists in the same location as before: the use of `target.call.value(msg.value)(data);` in the `Proxy` contract (line 14). This low-level call does not check for a return value, meaning if the call fails, it will not revert the transaction and the code will continue execution. This can lead to potential fail-open scenarios and unwanted behaviors.",1339,79,4.99789834022522

The vulnerability in the provided code lies in multiple functions of the `IntegerOverflowSingleTransaction` contract. Specifically:

1. **Arithmetic Operations Without Overflow Checks**:
    - In functions `overflowaddtostate`, `overflowmultostate`, `underflowtostate`, `overflowlocalonly`, `overflowmulocalonly`, and `underflowlocalonly`, there are arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, subtraction) performed without checks for overflow or underflow.
    - Solidity version `^0.4.23` does not have built-in protections against arithmetic overflows or underflows. Without using a library like SafeMath, these operations can lead to unexpected behavior, making the contract vulnerable to attacks.

2. **Vulnerable Lines**:
    - `count += input;` (line 18) is vulnerable to integer overflow.
    - `count *= input;` (line 24) is vulnerable to integer overflow.
    - `count -= input;` (line 30) is vulnerable to integer underflow.
    - `uint res = count + input;` (line 36) and `uint res = count * input;` (line 42) are vulnerable to overflow in the local variable `res`.
    - `uint res = count - input;` (line 48) is vulnerable to underflow in the local variable `res`.

These vulnerabilities can be exploited to manipulate the state of the contract, potentially allowing attackers to bypass restrictions or cause denial of service.",1247,308,8.397042512893677

The `transfer` function in the first `Token` contract uses arithmetic operations without checks for underflows or overflows. Specifically, the line:

```solidity
require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);

is dangerous because if `balances[msg.sender]` is smaller than `_value`, an underflow occurs, causing the balance to wrap around and allowing transfers of more tokens than the sender actually has.

In the `CustomToken` contract, though it inherits from `BaseToken`, there is no mention of how transfers are handled in this specific contract, and if a similar transfer mechanism as the first contract is used, it would also suffer from potential arithmetic vulnerabilities without checks.",1144,150,9.331418991088867

The smart contract is vulnerable due to the same reasons highlighted previously:

1. **Predictable randomness**: The contract attempts to generate random numbers using `block.timestamp`, `block.number`, and `blockhash`. These values are either predictable or can be influenced by miners, making the randomness unreliable and potentially exploitable by malicious actors.

2. **Specific vulnerabilities**:
   - **Line 12**: `uint256 private salt = block.timestamp;` - `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners within a small range.
   - **Line 18**: `uint256 y = salt * block.number / (salt % 5);` - This calculation uses `block.number`, which is a public value, and `salt`, which is also predictable based on `block.timestamp`.
   - **Line 20**: `uint256 seed = block.number / 3 + (salt % 300) + y;` - The `seed` is derived from predictable values, making the final random number predictable.
   - **Line 22**: `uint256 h = uint256(blockhash(seed));` - `blockhash` can only access hashes of the most recent 256 blocks, limiting its effectiveness in generating secure randomness. Additionally, block hashes can be influenced by miners.

This creates a **denial of service (DoS)** vulnerability because it becomes impossible to execute the function when the gas cost exceeds the block limit, effectively making the contract unusable.

The **large array** manipulation combined with the potential gas limit issue could lead to a **DoS attack**, preventing users from successfully interacting with the contract.",1224,204,7.852731227874756
134,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability arises from the `for` loop in the `insertNnumbers` function. Specifically, the dynamic resizing of the array (`array.length += 1;`) inside the loop can significantly increase gas consumption, potentially making the function too expensive to execute, especially with a large `numbers` input. This could lead to a denial of service by causing transactions to run out of gas, preventing the function from completing.",1324,90,6.950472354888916
135,denial of service,"**YES**, the smart contract is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability type is **denial of service** due to the following reasons:

1. **Line 46: `creditorAddresses = new address ;`**
   - Resetting the `creditorAddresses` array to an empty array without proper handling can lead to issues where the contract fails to track past creditors properly or create an indefinite loop.
   
2. **Line 48: `creditorAmounts = new uint ;`**
   - Similarly, resetting `creditorAmounts` to an empty array can cause the contract to lose information about creditors’ amounts. This can prevent the contract from executing payouts properly, leading to a state where no further actions are possible, effectively causing a denial of service for creditors.",2298,154,11.36616826057434
136,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability is still present in the `Refunder` contract. The use of `send` in the `refundAll` function can cause a denial of service (DoS). If any of the addresses in the `refundAddresses` list is unable to accept the refund (due to gas limits or other issues), the entire transaction will fail, preventing further refunds from being processed. This makes the contract vulnerable to a DoS attack, where a single failed send can block all refunds.",1207,99,5.986162424087524
137,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability still exists in the function `ifillArray()` of the `DosOneFunc` contract. The for-loop in line 17 (`for(uint i=0;i<350;i++) {`) combined with the `listAddresses.push(msg.sender);` in line 18 can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack. If the gas required to execute this loop exceeds the block gas limit, the function will fail and potentially render the contract unusable. This vulnerability arises because the loop grows linearly with every function call, increasing the gas required as the array size increases.",1101,121,6.677788019180298
138,denial of service,"YES, the vulnerability still exists in the `DosAuction` contract. The line `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` can cause a denial of service. If the `send` operation fails (for instance, if the recipient's address has a fallback function that consumes too much gas or if the recipient refuses to accept the funds), the transaction will revert, preventing any further bids from being placed.",1094,83,4.4368064403533936
