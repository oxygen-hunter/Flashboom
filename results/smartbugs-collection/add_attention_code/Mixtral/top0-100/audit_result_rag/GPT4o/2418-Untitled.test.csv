The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function. It allows any external caller to add a new owner by setting their address as the new owner's creator. Since there is no restriction on who can call this function, it opens the contract to unauthorized access, allowing attackers to add themselves as owners and bypass access control, which violates proper access control principles.",1224,72,8.278199911117554
12,access control,"YES

The vulnerability is due to the same issue as in the first contract: the `missing()` function is public and can be called by anyone, which allows any user to become the owner of the contract. This is a critical access control vulnerability, as it grants ownership privileges to any user, enabling them to call the `withdraw()` function and transfer the contract's balance to themselves.",962,77,6.042396306991577
13,access control,"YES

The vulnerability in this contract is due to the constructor being incorrectly named. The function `DynamicPyramid()` is intended to be the constructor, but since the contract uses Solidity version ^0.4.15, constructors must be named explicitly using the `constructor` keyword. Without this, `DynamicPyramid()` is treated as a regular public function, allowing anyone to call it and reset the `creator` address to their own, leading to an access control vulnerability.",2883,95,9.227156639099121

The vulnerability lies in the same line as the previous example:

The smart contract is vulnerable because of a lack of proper access control in multiple functions. Specifically:

1. **PushBonusCode**, **PopBonusCode**, and **UpdateBonusCodeAt** functions are public, meaning anyone can call them and manipulate the internal `bonusCodes` array. There is no restriction ensuring that only the owner can perform these actions.

2. The **Destroy** function only restricts access to the owner, but other critical functions (like modifying the bonus codes) do not have proper access control checks.

The vulnerability lies in the function `Constructor()`. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, constructors must have the same name as the contract.

26,access control,"YES

The contract is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` on lines 31 and 38. This function can execute code in the context of the caller, which can potentially allow an attacker to modify the contract's state or access sensitive functions without proper access control mechanisms. This opens the contract to access control vulnerabilities. Specifically:

The vulnerability still exists because the contract relies on `now` (which is an alias for `block.timestamp`) in both the fallback function and the `test` function. Since miners can manipulate `block.timestamp`, it allows for potential time manipulation, making the contract vulnerable to timestamp dependency. Specifically:

1. **Line 18**: `require(now != pastBlockTime);` – The contract attempts to ensure only one transaction per block by checking the timestamp. However, miners can manipulate `block.timestamp`, making this check unreliable.

This could eventually make the function unusable due to exceeding the gas limit, leading to a denial of service for any further interactions with the contract.",1237,89,7.961718559265137
135,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable because lines 46 (`creditorAddresses = new address ;`) and 48 (`creditorAmounts = new uint ;`) reset the arrays without properly compensating the creditors or managing the payout process. This can lead to a denial of service by disrupting the flow of funds to creditors.",2211,62,9.415905475616455
136,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the function `refundAll()`, specifically at the line:
```solidity
require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));
```
This is vulnerable to a **denial of service (DoS)** attack. If any address in the `refundAddresses` list rejects the transfer (for instance, if its fallback function runs out of gas or deliberately reverts), the entire loop will fail, blocking refunds to all subsequent addresses.",1120,98,6.186327934265137
137,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability still exists in the same part of the code. The `ifillArray()` function uses a for loop (`for(uint i=0; i<350; i++)`) to add the caller's address (`msg.sender`) to the `listAddresses` array. This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability because the gas required to execute the function will increase with the size of `listAddresses`. If the length of `listAddresses` becomes too large, the gas required to execute the function may exceed the block gas limit, causing the function to fail and potentially rendering the smart contract unusable.",1014,129,5.248980760574341
138,denial of service,"**YES**

The contract is still vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the same line of code: 

```solidity
require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));
```

This is vulnerable to a denial of service because the `send()` function will fail if the `currentFrontrunner` address is a contract with a fallback function that consumes too much gas or reverts. If this happens, the auction will be locked, and future bids will not be processed. This is because the function will not be able to successfully transfer funds back to the previous frontrunner.",1007,123,4.143744230270386
