The vulnerability exists in the `newOwner` function of the `MultiOwnable` contract. It allows any external user to add a new owner without restriction. There is no access control mechanism in place to limit who can call this function, which means anyone can add themselves as an owner and potentially exploit the contract's permissions. This falls under an ""access control"" vulnerability, as unauthorized users can bypass ownership checks.",1359,85,10.14342212677002
12,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `missing()` function, which is a public function and allows anyone to call it and change the owner of the contract to themselves. This breaks the access control of the contract because the `withdraw()` function relies on the `onlyowner` modifier, which checks if the caller is the owner. Since anyone can become the owner by calling `missing()`, they can then withdraw all the contract's funds.",1097,87,6.220019578933716
13,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the constructor function `DynamicPyramid()` (lines 23-25). In Solidity versions before 0.4.22, constructors have the same name as the contract. However, in this contract, the function is mistakenly named `DynamicPyramid()` instead of `Rubixi()`. This causes the function to be a regular public function rather than a constructor. As a result, anyone can call this function and change the owner of the contract by setting `creator = msg.sender`. This opens up an access control vulnerability, allowing attackers to take control of the contract.",3017,124,8.964190483093262
14,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function, where the condition `require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);` is incorrect. It should check if the user has enough balance to withdraw, meaning the correct condition should be `require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);`. Otherwise, it allows users to withdraw more than their balance, leading to an access control issue.",1214,73,5.538991451263428
15,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `IamMissing` function, where the owner can be reset by any caller since it is a public function.

16,access control,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable due to improper access control. In the `Map` contract, the `set` function allows any user to modify the `map` array without restriction. There is no access control mechanism limiting who can call the `set` function, allowing unauthorized users to modify the `map` data.

Additionally, in the `CustomToken` contract, the constructor does not provide proper access control for the token supply allocation. It directly assigns the total supply to a specific address without any verification of ownership or authorization. This could lead to unintended allocation or exploitation if the specified address is compromised.",1172,122,8.057137966156006
17,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `forward` function of the `Proxy` contract, which uses `delegatecall` without any access control mechanisms to restrict who can call it. This allows any external user to call the `forward` function and execute arbitrary code in the context of the `Proxy` contract. Since `delegatecall` executes the code in the context of the calling contract's state, it can result in malicious actions, such as unauthorized access or state changes. Therefore, this is an access control vulnerability.",1075,110,8.056253910064697
18,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `PopBonusCode()` function allows anyone to call it, reducing the length of the `bonusCodes` array without any access control. This can lead to unintended manipulation of the contract's state by unauthorized users. Additionally, the `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length)` check is redundant since array lengths are always non-negative. Therefore, the absence of proper access control in this function can result in misuse of the array management functionality.",1268,100,7.736234188079834
19,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the function named `Constructor()`. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, constructors are defined with the same name as the contract. However, in the `Missing` contract, the constructor is mistakenly named `Constructor()` instead of `Missing()`. This causes the function to be treated as a regular public function rather than a constructor.

The vulnerability lies in the `initWallet()` function, where the creator is set by anyone calling this function, meaning any external user can potentially overwrite the creator address.

The vulnerability is related to **access control** issues in the `Wallet` contract. Specifically, the `refund()` function does not have any access control mechanism to restrict who can call it.

23,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The `sudicideAnyone` function allows anyone to call the `selfdestruct(msg.sender)` function, which transfers the contract's balance to the caller's address and destroys the contract.

25,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable because the `require(tx.origin == owner)` check in the `withdrawAll` function can be exploited. This access control issue allows a phishing attack, where an attacker tricks the owner into calling another contract that then calls the `withdrawAll` function, bypassing the intended security check. This is because `tx.origin` refers to the original external account that initiated the transaction, not the immediate caller of the function. Using `tx.origin` for authentication is considered insecure.",1082,99,7.301704168319702

The contract is vulnerable due to the reckless use of `delegatecall` in two places:

1. **Line 31**: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(fibSig, withdrawalCounter));`
   - This line allows the `FibonacciBalance` contract to delegate execution to the external `fibonacciLibrary` contract. Since `delegatecall` runs the external code in the context of the calling contract, this can lead to security issues if the external contract is malicious or can be changed.

2. **Line 38**: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(msg.data));`
   - This fallback function allows any call to be delegated to the `fibonacciLibrary` contract with arbitrary data, further exposing the contract to potential security issues, such as unauthorized control or manipulation of the contract’s state.

Both uses of `delegatecall` represent access control vulnerabilities because they can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the `FibonacciBalance` contract.",1498,198,9.991928815841675

28,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the second contract is vulnerable. 

It inherits the same vulnerability as the first contract in the `Delta` contract due to the unchecked low-level call usage in the `send()` function. Specifically, lines involving `owner2.send(sum2)` and `owner.send(balance)` in the `Delta` contract remain unchecked for failure.

The loop at line 17 (`for(uint i=0;i<350;i++)`) repeatedly adds the sender's address to the `listAddresses` array, which could potentially consume too much gas. If the gas limit is exceeded during the execution of this function, it can lead to a denial of service, preventing further calls to this function or other parts of the contract from being executed. Therefore, it is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to excessive gas consumption.",1149,120,7.3425397872924805
