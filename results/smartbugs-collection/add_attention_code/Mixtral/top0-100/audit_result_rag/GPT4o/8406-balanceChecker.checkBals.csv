The smart contract is vulnerable to a front-running attack. The vulnerability occurs in the `play(uint number) payable` function, specifically at lines where the player's number is recorded in the `players` array. An attacker can observe a pending transaction of another player on the public blockchain, copy the transaction with a higher gas fee, and submit it faster. This allows them to preempt the original transaction, thus manipulating the game outcome in their favor.",1336,91,6.852256536483765
77,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the same line as before: `map[k] -= v;`. This code is susceptible to an integer underflow. Since Solidity versions before 0.8.x do not include automatic checks for overflow or underflow, if `v` is greater than `map[k]`, the subtraction will result in an integer underflow, allowing potentially unintended behavior such as a very large number being assigned to `map[k]`. This can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as tampering with contract states.",906,112,6.749131679534912
78,arithmetic,"YES.  
It is vulnerable due to the same reason as mentioned before: **arithmetic overflow** in the `IntegerOverflowMul` contract. The multiplication operation `count *= input` in line 17 is prone to overflow because there is no check to ensure that the result stays within the limits of the `uint` type (256 bits). This vulnerability can be exploited to cause unintended behavior in the contract.",886,82,6.683874845504761
79,arithmetic,NO,882,1,2.2054672241210938
80,arithmetic,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the first contract `IntegerOverflowMinimal`, where the line `count -= input;` could result in an integer underflow if `input` is greater than `count`. Since Solidity versions below 0.8.0 do not automatically handle arithmetic overflows or underflows, subtracting a larger number from a smaller one will cause the `count` to wrap around, which is an underflow vulnerability. This can potentially lead to malicious exploitation.",886,95,6.007900238037109
81,arithmetic,"YES

The vulnerability exists in the `increaseLockTime` function. Specifically, the line `lockTime[msg.sender] += _secondsToIncrease;` can cause an integer overflow. If `_secondsToIncrease` is a large enough value, it could push `lockTime[msg.sender]` beyond the maximum limit of an unsigned integer, resetting it to a smaller value, which would allow a user to withdraw funds prematurely. This is a form of arithmetic overflow vulnerability.",1107,94,9.436622858047485
82,arithmetic,"YES. The vulnerability exists due to potential arithmetic overflow and underflow issues in the `buy` and `sell` functions, similar to the first contract you provided. Specifically:

1. **Line 23 (`buy` function)**: `require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);` — Multiplying `numTokens` by `PRICE_PER_TOKEN` can result in an overflow if `numTokens` is large enough, leading to an incorrect `msg.value` check.
  
2. **Line 25 (`buy` function)**: `balanceOf[msg.sender] += numTokens;` — If `numTokens` is large, adding it to `balanceOf[msg.sender]` may cause an overflow, allowing for unauthorized token balance increases.

3. **Line 33 (`sell` function)**: `msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);` — Multiplying `numTokens` by `PRICE_PER_TOKEN` in the `sell` function can also lead to an overflow, potentially enabling the attacker to withdraw more Ether than intended.",1184,213,11.20379114151001
83,arithmetic,"YES

The vulnerability in the given smart contract lies in the `run` function, specifically in the line `count -= input;`.

This behavior can lead to a vulnerability where `count` can wrap around to a very large value, potentially leading to unintended behavior or exploitation.",970,85,7.350171089172363
84,arithmetic,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the same part of the code as in the previous example: `uint res = count - input;`. Since `count` is an unsigned integer and initialized to 1, if `input` is greater than `count`, an underflow will occur, resulting in an unexpected large value due to how unsigned integers behave in Solidity versions prior to 0.8, where overflow and underflow checks were not automatic.",899,93,7.372683763504028
85,arithmetic,"YES. The vulnerability still exists in the contract `IntegerOverflowMultiTxOneFuncFeasible` at the line `count -= input;`.

87,arithmetic,"YES. The vulnerability exists in the same way as in the first contract. Specifically:

- In the `transfer` function, the statement `require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);` does not prevent an underflow. Since `balances[msg.sender]` and `_value` are unsigned integers (`uint`), if `_value` is greater than `balances[msg.sender]`, the subtraction would cause an underflow, allowing the transfer to proceed with an incorrect balance.

- The line `balances[msg.sender] -= _value;` will also allow an underflow if `_value` exceeds `balances[msg.sender]`, resulting in an incorrect balance for the sender.",1097,138,8.536048412322998
88,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the same issue of integer overflow present in the `IntegerOverflowAdd` contract.

90,arithmetic,"YES

The vulnerability is due to the arithmetic overflow in the `balanceOf[_to] += _value;` operation, which can cause an overflow if `_value` is large enough.

This could be exploited to bypass restrictions on transferring tokens.",961,97,8.482495069503784
91,bad randomness,"YES. The contract is vulnerable because it relies on the `blockhash()` function to generate a random value in the `settle()` function.

The contract is vulnerable due to predictable randomness in the `chooseWinner` function. Specifically, it relies on the following sources for randomness, which are manipulable or predictable:

2. `msg.sender` (line 101) can be controlled by the user interacting with the contract.
3. `block.difficulty` (line 103) is public and predictable.

These factors allow an attacker to predict or manipulate the outcome of the raffle, making the contract susceptible to exploitation.",2752,115,10.346987247467041

The smart contract contains a vulnerability in the randomness function, specifically in the `rand` function.

The smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the loop that dynamically resizes the `array` and increases its length. When the array becomes too large, the gas required to execute the function grows significantly. This can cause the transaction to run out of gas, preventing the function from being executed.

The contract is vulnerable due to a potential **Denial of Service** (DoS) attack at line 46 and line 48. Reinitializing `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` to empty arrays using `creditorAddresses = new address ;` and `creditorAmounts = new uint ;` can lead to the loss of creditor information, which prevents further processing of creditors' payouts or their involvement in future transactions. This could cause a denial of service for creditors expecting to be paid out from the contract.",2251,109,7.185706377029419
136,denial of service,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable because in the `refundAll` function, it uses `send` to transfer funds to the addresses in the `refundAddresses` array. If any of the addresses' transfers fail (e.g., due to a malicious contract that refuses to accept ETH or consumes excessive gas), the entire transaction will revert, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). This means that even if other addresses can receive refunds, the failure of one will block all future refunds, creating a vulnerability to DoS attacks.",1160,107,10.089766502380371
137,denial of service,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable due to the same issue as in the first example. The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function, particularly in the `for` loop where it tries to push `msg.sender` 350 times into `listAddresses`. This can lead to a **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack by consuming excessive gas, which could prevent the function from completing if the gas limit is exceeded. Thus, the function may fail, and future users may be unable to interact with the contract effectively, resulting in a DoS situation.",1054,115,6.71505069732666
138,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability exists due to the `currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid)` statement. If the recipient (the current frontrunner) is a contract with a fallback function that fails or consumes more than the provided gas, the `send` function will fail, causing the entire transaction to revert. This can result in a denial of service, preventing others from placing bids and locking the contract.",1047,81,7.60860800743103
