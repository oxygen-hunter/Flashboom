The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in the `newOwner` function, which allows any external user to assign themselves or others as new owners.

12,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability arises from the public `missing()` function, which allows anyone to set themselves as the owner of the contract. This bypasses proper access control and permits unauthorized users to withdraw the contract's balance by calling the `withdraw()` function, as long as they invoke the `missing()` function first to become the owner. This issue is related to access control vulnerabilities.",1098,81,8.643399238586426
13,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because the `DynamicPyramid()` function is not marked as a constructor due to the outdated Solidity version (`^0.4.15`). In this version, constructors must have the same name as the contract, and here the function name `DynamicPyramid()` does not match the contract name `Rubixi`. As a result, this function can be called by anyone, allowing them to reassign the `creator` variable to their own address, giving them control over the contract. This is an **access control** vulnerability.",3018,112,14.94261384010315
14,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable because of the same access control issue in the `withdraw` function:

16,access control,"YES

The vulnerability in the second smart contract still exists in the same place as the first one. Specifically, the function `set(uint256 key, uint256 value)` allows anyone to modify the `map` array without proper access control.

The vulnerability lies in the same line: `require(tx.origin == owner);`. Using `tx.origin` for access control is insecure because it can be exploited in phishing attacks.

The contract is vulnerable to the same arithmetic overflow/underflow issues as the previous one. Specifically:

The vulnerability is still present in the second smart contract. The randomness mechanism relies on block characteristics (e.g., block number and blockhash) which can be influenced or predicted by miners. Specifically, the use of `block.blockhash(lastBlockNumber)` in the `rand` function (lines 128-132) makes the contract susceptible to manipulation, as miners can control aspects of the block data to influence the outcome of the randomness.
