The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function of the `MultiOwnable` contract. Specifically, the function allows any external caller to add a new owner to the contract without any proper access control mechanism verifying if the caller is authorized. This means that any address can call `newOwner` and set themselves or another address as an owner, thus compromising the access control of the contract.

This allows unauthorized users to gain control over the contract and perform privileged actions, like transferring funds from `TestContract` via the `withdrawAll` function.",1235,111,5.528306007385254
12,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because the constructor function `missing()` (line 10) is public, allowing anyone to call it and take ownership of the contract. This means that any external user can reassign the `owner` variable to themselves, bypassing the intended access control.

The smart contract is vulnerable because the constructor function is incorrectly named `Constructor` instead of `constructor`. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, the constructor must be named `constructor` (all lowercase) for it to function correctly.

73,front running,"YES. 

The contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks because the transaction ordering can be exploited. Specifically:

- In the `setReward()` function (line 23), the `owner.transfer(reward)` transfers the reward to the owner before updating the reward value to `msg.value`. This allows an attacker to monitor transactions and send their own transaction with a higher gas fee to set the reward to a new value, exploiting the delay before the original transaction is mined.

- In the `claimReward()` function (line 31), the `msg.sender.transfer(reward)` is vulnerable to front-running as well, where an attacker can see the pending claim and submit a transaction with a higher fee to claim the reward first.",1088,144,8.996382236480713
74,front running,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the same line:

```solidity
require(hash == sha3(solution));

76,front running,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

It is susceptible to a front-running attack. Specifically, the vulnerability arises in the `play` function, where players submit their numbers for the game. Because the Ethereum blockchain is public, an attacker can observe the first player's transaction and submit a competing transaction with a higher gas fee to ensure their transaction is mined first. This allows the attacker to predict the game outcome and manipulate it to their advantage, leading to a front-running attack.",1307,94,6.623274326324463

Specifically, the reliance on `now` (which is an alias for `block.timestamp`) at lines 18 and 20 introduces the possibility of manipulation by miners.",1022,56,4.918178558349609
131,time manipulation,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` to generate a random number in the line:

```solidity
var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;
```

Miners can manipulate the value of `block.timestamp`, which makes this contract susceptible to time manipulation attacks, leading to predictable randomness. This can be exploited to influence the outcome of the lottery game.",1132,81,6.260693311691284
132,short addresses,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to the **short address attack** possibility in the `sendCoin` function of the `MyToken` contract. Since Solidity versions prior to 0.5.x do not enforce strict checks on the length of the address and integer parameters, an attacker can craft a transaction with a shorter address, causing the second parameter (`amount`) to be incorrectly decoded and leading to a manipulation of funds. This vulnerability arises from the interaction between the client-side encoding of arguments and the EVM.",1180,104,6.434796571731567
133,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability in the provided code lies in the `emptyCreditors()` function, specifically with the operation on `creditorAddresses` when its length exceeds 1500. The gas cost to reset the `creditorAddresses` array to zero using `creditorAddresses = new address ;` could become excessively high, potentially causing the transaction to run out of gas, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) attack. Attackers or normal users can trigger this condition, preventing the contract from resetting the array and making the `emptyCreditors()` function effectively unusable.",1148,117,6.104402780532837
134,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function. Specifically:

1. **Gas Limit Denial of Service**: The loop in the `insertNnumbers` function increases the length of the `array` dynamically and performs multiple iterations based on the `numbers` argument. As the array grows, the function could eventually run out of gas when the array becomes too large. This causes a denial of service because subsequent calls to this function or other functions interacting with the array may fail due to the excessive gas required for execution.

This vulnerability can be exploited by a user to trigger a denial of service for other users interacting with the contract.",1248,130,5.53640079498291
135,denial of service,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to a **denial of service (DoS)** attack. Specifically, the lines:

- `creditorAddresses = new address ;`
- `creditorAmounts = new uint ;`

are resetting the arrays `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` to zero. This could prevent creditors from being paid out properly, especially if the length of the arrays is manipulated in an unexpected way or if gas limitations prevent certain operations from being processed, causing a DoS.",2222,102,5.875992774963379
136,denial of service,"YES. The `Refunder` contract is vulnerable because of the use of `send` within the `refundAll` function. If any `send` operation fails (e.g., if a recipient is a smart contract with a fallback function that uses more than 2300 gas, or if the recipient rejects the transfer), the entire loop will stop due to the `require` statement, leading to a denial of service. This could prevent other valid refund recipients from receiving their refunds, which makes the contract vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack.",1131,109,5.436779975891113
137,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability still exists in the `DosOneFunc` contract. The `for` loop in the `ifillArray` function (line 17) pushes up to 350 addresses into the `listAddresses` array each time the function is called. This can result in an out-of-gas error when the array grows too large, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) as the contract will eventually be unable to execute due to high gas consumption. Thus, malicious actors or even regular users can trigger this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the function until it becomes unusable.",1025,118,5.156508207321167
138,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` line. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) because if the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that rejects payments or if the transfer fails due to gas limit restrictions, the function will revert, preventing any new bids from being accepted.",1018,79,7.720672845840454
