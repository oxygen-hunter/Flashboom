The contract is vulnerable due to improper access control in the `newOwner` function. The vulnerability allows any external address to assign themselves as an owner by calling the `newOwner` function.

In the `CustomToken` contract, the `Transfer` event is emitted but the Solidity event syntax changed after version 0.4.21 to require the use of `emit`. Without this, the event is not properly emitted, potentially causing discrepancies in how transfers are tracked externally.

Additionally, there is no access control mechanism in place, which can expose functionality to unauthorized users. For example, anyone could potentially call functions that alter token balances. The constructor function is also vulnerable since it is not marked as `constructor`, and anyone can call it, allowing them to reinitialize the contract's state.",1225,129,11.771995544433594

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the function `Constructor()` is not recognized as a constructor in Solidity versions before 0.5.0.

The contract is vulnerable due to the improper use of `delegatecall` in the `withdraw` and fallback functions. Specifically, the access control vulnerability arises from the `delegatecall` in line 31 and line 38. 

In line 31, the `withdraw` function makes a delegate call to the `fibonacciLibrary`, executing the `setFibonacci` function. However, this could be exploited if the attacker controls the `fibonacciLibrary` contract, as they could manipulate the `calculatedFibNumber` value, causing the contract to transfer an incorrect amount of ether. 

In line 38, the fallback function also uses `delegatecall` with the `msg.data`, which opens the possibility for an attacker to send arbitrary data to the `fibonacciLibrary` and potentially manipulate the state or behavior of the contract.

The use of `delegatecall` in proxy contracts, especially with user-controlled input, leads to the vulnerability of allowing attackers to execute unintended logic in the context of the calling contract. This is a significant security issue in this contract.",1455,216,8.909280776977539

This is a low-level call, and its return value is not checked. As mentioned, low-level calls like `call()` do not propagate errors, meaning if the call fails (e.g., due to the target contract not having enough gas or being in an invalid state), it won't revert the transaction or signal failure. Instead, it simply returns `false`, and the contract continues execution, which can lead to unexpected behavior or financial loss.

To fix this vulnerability, the return value of `call()` should be checked to ensure that the transaction was successful, like so:

```solidity
require(_target.call.value(_value)());
``` 

This ensures the transaction reverts if the call fails, making the contract more secure.",1174,191,11.847023248672485

The contract is vulnerable due to the unchecked low-level call in the `proxy` function at line 14: `target.call.value(msg.value)(data);`. This line uses the low-level `call` function to send Ether to another contract. The issue is that the return value of the `call` is not checked. If the call fails, the transaction will continue to execute, which could lead to unexpected behavior or loss of funds. It is crucial to check the return value of `call` to ensure that the transaction was successful and avoid such vulnerabilities.",1344,114,3.8642306327819824

This can lead to a **Denial of Service** (DoS) attack, where legitimate creditors are blocked from receiving their owed payments because their data is erased before payout completion.",2303,122,14.351418256759644
136,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll()` function in the `Refunder` contract. If the `send()` function fails for any address in the `refundAddresses` array, it will revert the entire transaction, preventing the function from processing refunds for the remaining addresses. This can be exploited to create a denial of service, as a single failure can block all future refunds.",1212,83,11.725563049316406
137,denial of service,"YES

The contract is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. In the function `ifillArray()`, the loop on line 17 (`for(uint i=0;i<350;i++)`) can consume significant gas. If the `listAddresses` array grows larger, the function will require more gas to execute, and users may not be able to fill the array when it gets larger. This could effectively block other users from interacting with the contract, causing a denial of service.",1106,102,4.163095951080322
138,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability exists due to the use of `currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid)` in the `DosAuction` contract. The `send` function only forwards 2300 gas to the recipient, which may be insufficient if the recipient's fallback function is complex or if the recipient is a contract. If the `send` operation fails, the entire `bid` function will revert, preventing further bids. This creates a denial of service (DoS) scenario, as the contract can become locked, preventing any new bids from being accepted.
