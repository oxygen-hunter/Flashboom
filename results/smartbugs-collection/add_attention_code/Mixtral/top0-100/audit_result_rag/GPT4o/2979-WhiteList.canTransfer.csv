The vulnerability lies in the use of `delegatecall` in the `forward` function. `delegatecall` allows the called contract to execute code in the context of the caller, meaning it can manipulate the caller's state, including sensitive data like the contract's storage variables. Without proper access control on this function, any user can call `forward` and potentially delegate execution to an untrusted contract, which can lead to malicious behavior, such as modifying the contract's state or taking over control.

The vulnerability is due to the same issue as the previous contract. The function `solve(string solution)` uses `require(hash == sha3(solution));` to check if the solution matches a stored hash. Since the Ethereum blockchain is public, a malicious user can observe the original user's transaction containing the solution and then front-run it by submitting a transaction with higher gas fees, allowing them to steal the reward of 1000 ether. This is a front-running vulnerability.",997,101,6.6942455768585205
75,front running,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because the `approve` function in the ERC20 contract allows for the same front-running attack risk. A malicious user can observe the transaction approving a certain allowance and front-run it by sending their transaction with higher gas fees to exploit the allowance setting. This vulnerability lies in line 107:

```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 value) public returns (bool) {
```

",2071,85,5.891611576080322
76,front running,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the same logic as the previously discussed smart contract. The function `play(uint number) payable` allows users to submit their number along with the transaction. This logic can be exploited by front-running attacks, where an attacker monitors the blockchain for the first player’s transaction, copies it, and submits a new transaction with a higher gas fee to preempt the original transaction. This gives the attacker a chance to influence the outcome of the game.",1270,97,6.6479809284210205
77,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because the line `map[k] -= v;` in the `init` function can cause an integer underflow, which is part of the ""arithmetic.sol"" vulnerability type.

The contract is vulnerable due to an integer overflow in the `run` function, where the multiplication operation (`count *= input`) can result in an overflow if the `input` is large enough, especially since Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0 do not automatically check for overflows and underflows.",820,64,5.654526233673096
79,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because it still contains the same potential for an integer overflow in the `add` function on line 14: `balance += deposit;`. This is the same vulnerability as described in the previous contract where, if a very large `deposit` is provided, it could cause `balance` to wrap around and overflow. This issue exists due to the absence of safe arithmetic checks in Solidity version 0.4.25, which does not have built-in overflow protection.",816,100,8.306143283843994
80,arithmetic,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is the same as in the previous code, which is an arithmetic underflow in the `run(uint256 input)` function. The subtraction operation `count -= input;` can result in an underflow if `input` is greater than `count`. Since `count` is initialized to 1, passing any value greater than 1 for `input` would cause an underflow, wrapping the value around and potentially allowing unintended behavior such as setting `count` to a very large number.",820,106,7.785430908203125
81,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because the vulnerability still exists in the `increaseLockTime` function. Specifically, it is vulnerable to an arithmetic overflow in the line:

- **Line 101**: `address seed2 = contestants[uint(msg.sender) % totalTickets].addr;` relies on `msg.sender`, which can be controlled by the user.
- **Line 103**: `uint seed3 = block.difficulty;` uses `block.difficulty`, which, while less predictable, is still not entirely secure for generating randomness. 

These sources do not provide sufficient unpredictability, allowing attackers to potentially predict or influence the raffle outcome.",2687,163,9.955677032470703
93,bad randomness,"YES

The contract is vulnerable due to the same randomness issue as before. The `rand` function in this contract uses the previous block hash (`block.blockhash(lastBlockNumber)`) to generate randomness, which can be influenced by miners.

94,bad randomness,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.number % 2 == 0` to determine whether the user has won the bet. Block numbers are predictable and can be influenced by miners, allowing them to manipulate the outcome. This makes the randomness predictable, which is a significant flaw when relying on it for outcomes like bets. Thus, it is vulnerable to a bad randomness attack.",1255,78,5.035534620285034

127,time manipulation,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` in the `isSaleFinished` function. As miners can manipulate the block's timestamp, relying on this value can lead to time manipulation attacks, where the actual timing of events like the end of a sale can be manipulated by the miner for their advantage. This makes the contract susceptible to exploitation.",884,72,6.207709312438965

Both of these usages can be manipulated by miners, leading to potential vulnerabilities.",1118,67,6.0442047119140625
129,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability in the code is due to the use of `block.timestamp` for time-based logic. Miners can manipulate `block.timestamp`, and since the `resetInvestment()` function depends on this value, it can be exploited.

130,time manipulation,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the usage of `now` (an alias for `block.timestamp`) in the fallback function. Since `block.timestamp` can be influenced by miners within a certain range, the contract's reliance on `now` for critical logic, such as `require(now != pastBlockTime);` and determining payouts based on `now % 15 == 0`, makes it susceptible to manipulation.

133,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `emptyCreditors` function, specifically with the operation of resetting the `creditorAddresses` array when its length exceeds 1500. If the array becomes too large, this operation can consume an excessive amount of gas, leading to a denial of service as it may prevent the function from being executed due to gas limits. This is an example of a gas limit vulnerability, which can be exploited to cause a denial of service in the contract.",1111,102,6.591527462005615
134,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability still lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, where dynamically increasing the array size within the loop (lines 19-22) can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) by consuming an excessive amount of gas. When the array length becomes too large, this operation will require an increasing amount of gas, potentially exceeding the block gas limit and making it impossible to execute the function, thus rendering the contract unusable.",1211,95,7.108031749725342
135,denial of service,"YES

The contract is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the fact that if a malicious creditor's address refuses to receive funds (e.g., by reverting when receiving Ether), the `lendGovernmentMoney()` function's attempt to send payments to creditors will fail. This can prevent the entire process of paying out creditors from completing, effectively causing a denial of service and preventing other creditors from being paid. 

Additionally, the use of `send()` (which sends only 2300 gas and fails if the recipient runs out of gas) exacerbates this risk.",2185,122,9.150514125823975
136,denial of service,"YES. 

The contract is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to the use of `send()` in the `refundAll()` function. If any one of the `send()` operations fails (for example, if one recipient address rejects the transfer due to insufficient gas), the entire loop will revert, preventing further refunds and causing a denial of service for all recipients. This vulnerability is similar to the issue in the previous contract.",1094,90,6.198261260986328
137,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is similar to the previous one. The function `ifillArray` contains a `for` loop (line 16: `for(uint i=0;i<350;i++)`) that repeatedly pushes addresses into the `listAddresses` array (line 17: `listAddresses.push(msg.sender);`). As the size of the array grows, this operation becomes increasingly expensive in terms of gas. Eventually, the gas cost could exceed the block gas limit, making the function fail and causing a denial of service for anyone trying to interact with the contract. This makes the contract vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack.",988,132,8.325539588928223
138,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability remains in the same line as the previous contract: `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));`. If the current frontrunner's address is a contract that does not properly accept Ether or has a fallback function that consumes all the gas, the `send()` function will fail, causing the entire transaction to revert. This can be exploited to block any further bids, effectively creating a denial-of-service condition.",982,91,8.230005264282227
