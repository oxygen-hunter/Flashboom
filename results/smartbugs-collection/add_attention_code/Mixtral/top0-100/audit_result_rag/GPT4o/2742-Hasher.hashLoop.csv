An attacker could use this to add unauthorized owners, gaining control over the contract.",1232,56,8.55591607093811
12,access control,"YES. The contract is vulnerable because the `missing()` function is publicly accessible, allowing anyone to become the owner by calling this function. This creates an access control issue where an unauthorized user can take ownership of the contract and withdraw its balance.",970,48,5.192629098892212
13,access control,"YES. The vulnerability is due to the unrestricted access to the constructor function `DynamicPyramid`, which allows anyone to call it and set themselves as the contract's `creator`.

15,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `IamMissing` function, which allows anyone to call this function and become the contract's owner. Since there is no restriction (e.g., `onlyowner` modifier) on who can call the `IamMissing` function, any user can overwrite the `owner` address by invoking it, leading to an access control vulnerability where unauthorized users can gain ownership of the contract.",980,86,7.455875635147095
16,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the absence of access control in the `set` function, which allows any user to modify the values in the `map` array. This can lead to unauthorized manipulation of the contract's state.",1045,50,5.197253942489624
17,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `forward` function, which uses `delegatecall` without proper access control or validation of the `callee` address. This allows any user to call the function and potentially execute malicious code within the context of the `Proxy` contract, which could lead to security issues such as unauthorized access to the contract's storage or manipulation of its logic. This is a classic case of an access control vulnerability involving unsafe usage of `delegatecall`.",948,98,7.024335145950317
18,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the access control of public functions such as `PushBonusCode`, `PopBonusCode`, and `UpdateBonusCodeAt`, which are accessible to anyone. There are no restrictions to limit who can modify the `bonusCodes` array, allowing any external user to manipulate the array, potentially leading to unintended behavior.

Additionally, the condition `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length)` is always true since the array length is unsigned, making it a pointless check.",1141,97,4.846083164215088
19,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the function `Constructor()`. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, constructors are defined with the same name as the contract. However, in this contract, the function `Constructor()` is not treated as a constructor because the function name should match the contract name exactly in older Solidity versions. Therefore, the actual constructor is missing, which means that the `owner` is never initialized, leading to a critical access control vulnerability. Any address could call the `withdraw()` function and drain the contract's balance.",970,110,9.28718376159668
20,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is related to **access control**, specifically in the `initWallet()` function. This function is marked as `public`, allowing anyone to call it and set the `creator` to their own address. This gives an attacker the ability to gain control over the contract's creator-only functions, such as `migrateTo()`, which allows the transfer of the contract's entire balance.",1105,85,5.730061769485474
21,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the use of `tx.origin` for access control in the `sendTo` function. This is a well-known vulnerability, as `tx.origin` can be exploited in phishing attacks where a malicious contract tricks the owner into initiating a transaction, and `tx.origin` would still be the owner's address, bypassing proper security checks. Instead, `msg.sender` should be used for more reliable caller authentication.",937,87,7.766718864440918

23,access control,"YES. 

The contract is vulnerable due to the function `sudicideAnyone()` allowing any caller to trigger the `selfdestruct` function, which transfers all the contract's funds to the caller (`msg.sender`). There is no access control mechanism to restrict who can call this function, making it possible for anyone to destroy the contract and drain its funds.",896,72,5.9320409297943115
24,access control,"YES. The vulnerability exists because the `changeOwner` function does not implement the `onlyowner` modifier, meaning any user can change the contract's owner without restriction. This is an access control vulnerability.",977,41,4.334712743759155
25,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable because the `withdrawAll` function still relies on `tx.origin` to validate the caller, which is insecure.

26,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability stems from the use of `delegatecall` in lines 31 and 38, which can be exploited in an access control context. Specifically:

1. **Line 31**: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(fibSig, withdrawalCounter));` allows an external contract (`fibonacciLibrary`) to execute code in the context of the `FibonacciBalance` contract. This makes it susceptible to malicious manipulation if an attacker can modify or replace the `fibonacciLibrary` address, allowing arbitrary code execution.
  
2. **Line 38**: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(msg.data));` again uses `delegatecall` with `msg.data`, which is risky since an attacker could potentially craft data to execute arbitrary functions within the context of the calling contract. This opens up further possibilities for unauthorized actions or state manipulation.",1371,176,12.229687213897705
27,unchecked low level calls,"YES. The vulnerability in the code lies in the function `Command`:

This check is ineffective for preventing underflows because it subtracts `_value` from `balances[msg.sender]` before the `require` statement evaluates the result. If `_value` is greater than `balances[msg.sender]`, an underflow occurs before the `require` condition is checked, making it possible for malicious actors to bypass this check and cause incorrect transfers.

- **Line 101**: `address seed2 = contestants[uint(msg.sender) % totalTickets].addr;` is influenced by the calling address, which can be manipulated by an attacker.
- **Line 103**: `uint seed3 = block.difficulty;` is another miner-controlled variable, also manipulable. 

These predictable sources make the randomness used to determine the winner unreliable.",2720,138,9.466124296188354
93,bad randomness,"YES

The contract is vulnerable due to the use of `block.blockhash(lastBlockNumber)` in the `rand` function to generate randomness.

- **Line 18**: `uint256 y = salt * block.number / (salt % 5);` — The use of predictable variables like `block.number` and `salt` reduces randomness and can be manipulated.
- **Line 20**: `uint256 seed = block.number / 3 + (salt % 300) + y;` — The `block.number` and `salt` combination can be easily replicated by an attacker, weakening security.
- **Line 22**: `uint256 h = uint256(blockhash(seed));` — Using `blockhash` with a predictable `seed` leads to vulnerability, as the `blockhash` function becomes unreliable for future blocks.
