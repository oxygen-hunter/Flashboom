Additionally, the `send` method used for sending funds can fail silently, potentially locking the contract in a state where future creditors are blocked from receiving payments if an address is unable to receive funds.",2198,114,7.418877124786377
136,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability lies in line 27: `require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));`. If a single `send` call fails, the entire loop and function will revert, causing a denial of service (DoS) for the remaining refund operations.",1107,59,6.4670491218566895
137,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the same place as in the first contract:

1. **Line 22**: `for(uint i=0;i<350;i++) {` – This loop can consume a significant amount of gas, potentially exceeding the block gas limit and causing a denial of service (DoS) when the array gets large.

2. **Line 23**: `listAddresses.push(msg.sender);` – Continuously appending addresses in the loop adds to the gas cost, making the function prone to failure due to exceeding gas limits, effectively making the contract unusable.",1001,119,8.559705257415771
138,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the line:  
`require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));`  
If the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract with a fallback function that uses a significant amount of gas or deliberately fails, it could prevent the contract from proceeding, thereby causing a denial of service (DoS) by blocking new bids. This is because the `send` function forwards only 2300 gas, which might not be enough for complex fallback functions, leading to a failure of the `require` condition and halting the execution of the contract.",994,123,9.064457178115845
