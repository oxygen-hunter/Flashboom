The contract is vulnerable because the constructor function is incorrectly named `missing` instead of `constructor`.

The smart contract is vulnerable due to the use of `tx.origin` in the `sendTo` function, which is not a secure way to check for the contract owner.

The vulnerability lies in the same place: `count *= input;`. This operation can still result in an integer overflow in versions of Solidity prior to 0.8, which does not automatically handle overflows and underflows. The addition of the `emitEvent` function does not mitigate this vulnerability, so the arithmetic overflow issue remains.",814,75,7.865554571151733
79,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because of the same issue found in the initial code: the potential for integer overflow in the `add` function.

80,arithmetic,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable because the vulnerability from the original code (arithmetic underflow in `count -= input;`) still exists.

It is vulnerable because the line `lockTime[msg.sender] += _secondsToIncrease;` can still cause an integer overflow, which could allow a user to bypass the lock time by setting it to a value that effectively becomes zero.",1035,49,5.648346185684204
82,arithmetic,"YES

The vulnerability exists due to potential integer overflows and underflows. Specifically:

- **Line 23:** `require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);` can lead to an integer overflow if `numTokens` is large enough, causing the multiplication to wrap around.
- **Line 25:** `balanceOf[msg.sender] += numTokens;` can lead to an integer overflow if `balanceOf[msg.sender]` becomes too large.
- **Line 33:** `msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);` can also lead to an overflow if `numTokens` is manipulated, resulting in an incorrect transfer amount.

These overflows could be exploited to drain the contract or cause unintended behavior.",1112,147,11.368472337722778

88,arithmetic,"YES

The contract is vulnerable to an arithmetic overflow in the same way as the previous contract. The vulnerability lies in the `run` function at the line `count += input;`.

91,bad randomness,"YES. The contract is vulnerable because it relies on `blockhash(guesses[msg.sender].block)` to generate the answer, which is predictable. The `blockhash()` function can only access hashes of the most recent 256 blocks, and since the block number is predetermined, a malicious actor can compute the block hash in advance or manipulate the block to their advantage, allowing them to predict the outcome and exploit the contract.

The vulnerability lies in the same parts as the previously evaluated contract:

- **Line 18**: `uint256 y = salt * block.number / (salt % 5);` — This relies on `block.number`, which is also predictable and can be influenced.
- **Line 20**: `uint256 seed = block.number / 3 + (salt % 300) + y;` — Again, using `block.number` and `salt` contributes to the predictability of the random number.

The vulnerability in the second smart contract is the same as in the first one. Specifically, the function `withdraw(uint amount)` on line 19 uses `msg.sender.call.value(amount)()`, which is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

The vulnerability in the code lies in the `getFirstWithdrawalBonus` function. The call to `withdrawReward(recipient)` happens before the `claimedBonus[recipient]` flag is set to `true`.

The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function, specifically in the line:

106,reentrancy,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the use of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `Collect` function. This pattern allows for a potential reentrancy attack, as external contract calls are made without updating the contract's state before the call.

109,reentrancy,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability arises from a potential **reentrancy attack** on the `airDrop` function. The `supportsToken` modifier calls an external contract (`Bank` or `attack`), which allows the attacker's contract (`attack`) to recursively call `airDrop()` before the first call has completed.

The vulnerability is caused by the line:

The vulnerability lies in the same location as before: the `insertNnumbers` function. Specifically:

- Line 19: `if(numElements == array.length)` and Line 20: `array.length += 1` dynamically resize the array, which is costly in terms of gas and can lead to an out-of-gas exception if done repeatedly in large numbers. This can make the contract unusable.",1205,129,11.187235593795776

The vulnerability is the same as in the previous code. Specifically, the `for` loop in line 18 (`for(uint i=0;i<350;i++)`) repeatedly calls `listAddresses.push(msg.sender);`.
