11,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function of the `MultiOwnable` contract. Specifically, the function allows any caller to assign themselves as the owner of any address by calling `newOwner`, effectively bypassing proper access control. This can lead to unauthorized users becoming owners and potentially gaining control over the contract.",1311,72,8.562999486923218
12,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `onlyOwner` modifier and the `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract. Although the `onlyOwner` modifier is used to restrict access to the function, the issue arises because the `Ownable` contract does not set an initial owner. If the `owner` variable in `Ownable` is not initialized properly, anyone can call `multisend` before ownership is assigned, potentially allowing unauthorized users to execute the function and transfer tokens. This is an access control vulnerability.",1049,111,8.702858209609985
13,access control,"YES, the vulnerability lies in the function `DynamicPyramid()`. It sets `creator = msg.sender` without any restriction, allowing anyone to call it and become the owner. This is an access control issue.",2969,43,6.939879655838013
14,access control,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable because the `withdraw` function contains an incorrect condition on line 16:

```solidity
require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);
```

This allows users to withdraw more than their balance, leading to potential fund drains. Additionally, the contract lacks proper access control measures for critical functions like the `withdraw` and `migrateTo` functions, making it prone to attacks targeting access control.",1166,85,8.600947141647339
15,access control,"YES. The vulnerability in the code relates to access control, particularly with the function `IamMissing()` in the `Missing` contract. This function allows any user to reset the owner of the contract by calling it, which leads to unauthorized access and control over the contract. This means anyone can take ownership by invoking `IamMissing()`, and subsequently withdraw funds using the `withdraw()` function.

Furthermore, in the `Airdropper` contract, while the `onlyOwner` modifier is used, the `multisend` function performs a loop over user-provided addresses (`dests`) and values (`values`), which could lead to high gas costs, potentially causing a failure due to gas limits if too many addresses are provided. This creates a potential denial-of-service scenario for the `multisend` function.",1059,165,7.103445053100586
16,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `set` function. This function allows any user to update the values in the `map` without any access control mechanism, meaning anyone can modify the data stored in the contract. There is no check to ensure that only the owner or authorized users can set values, leading to potential unauthorized access and manipulation of the contract's data.",1124,77,9.548718929290771
17,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `delegatecall` in the `Proxy` contract (line 19). `delegatecall` is dangerous because it executes the code of the called contract in the context of the caller's storage, meaning any untrusted contract could manipulate the storage of the `Proxy` contract, potentially altering critical variables like the `owner`. This can result in access control issues where unauthorized entities can take control of the contract or execute malicious code.",1027,98,6.564711093902588
18,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the lack of access control on certain functions in the `Wallet` contract. Specifically:

1. The `PushBonusCode`, `PopBonusCode`, and `UpdateBonusCodeAt` functions can be called by anyone, allowing unauthorized parties to manipulate the bonus codes. These functions should have proper access control to restrict access, such as an `onlyOwner` modifier.

2. The `PopBonusCode` function decrements the `bonusCodes.length` without clearing or checking the last element, potentially allowing manipulation of the internal state of the contract.

Additionally, the `Airdropper` contract in combination with the `Ownable` contract could also have vulnerabilities if the ownership of the contract is not properly managed or transferred. Although the `onlyOwner` modifier is present, it is essential to ensure proper owner assignment and transfer processes.",1220,173,10.227852821350098
19,access control,"YES. The first contract `Missing` has a vulnerability in the constructor due to incorrect naming. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, the constructor should be named the same as the contract (`Missing`). However, it is incorrectly named `Constructor`, making it a regular public function rather than a constructor. This allows any user to call the function and become the owner of the contract, bypassing access control.

",1049,85,9.643205165863037
20,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `initWallet` function of the `Wallet` contract. Since this function is `public`, it allows anyone to call it and set themselves as the `creator`, giving them full control of the contract, including transferring all funds with the `migrateTo` function. 

Additionally, the `Airdropper` contract contains an access control vulnerability due to the use of an `onlyOwner` modifier that can be bypassed if ownership is not securely initialized or transferred, as the `owner` address is set publicly.",1184,112,6.983859539031982
21,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `tx.origin == owner` in the `sendTo` function. This is an access control vulnerability because using `tx.origin` to validate ownership can be exploited in a phishing attack, where the attacker tricks the owner into calling a malicious contract that subsequently calls this contract. Instead of validating the caller with `msg.sender`, which is more secure, the contract incorrectly relies on `tx.origin`, leading to potential compromise in ownership checks.",1016,99,7.417642831802368
22,access control,"YES. 

The vulnerability lies in the `refund()` function of the `Wallet` contract. It allows any user to call `msg.sender.transfer(balances[msg.sender]);` and withdraw their entire balance without any restriction or condition beyond having a balance. This could lead to potential misuse or unintended behavior, as there is no additional access control to ensure only authorized users can execute such functions. Furthermore, there is no control on who can call the `migrateTo()` function, allowing the contract's entire balance to be transferred to any arbitrary address.",1204,110,6.0980682373046875
23,access control,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to an **access control** issue in the `SimpleSuicide` contract. Specifically, the `sudicideAnyone()` function allows **anyone** to call the `selfdestruct(msg.sender)` function, which transfers the contract's remaining balance to the caller's address. Since there is no restriction on who can invoke this function, it creates a serious vulnerability by enabling any attacker to destroy the contract and steal any funds it holds.",975,96,8.32878041267395
24,access control,"YES, the vulnerability lies in the `Unprotected` contract's `changeOwner` function, which allows anyone to change the ownership of the contract without proper access control, as it lacks the `onlyowner` modifier.",1056,44,5.71265721321106
25,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `Phishable` contract, specifically with the `require(tx.origin == owner)` check in the `withdrawAll` function. Using `tx.origin` for access control can be exploited in phishing attacks, where an attacker tricks the contract owner into calling a malicious contract that calls `withdrawAll` indirectly. Since `tx.origin` refers to the original sender of the transaction, the attacker's contract can pass this check, allowing unauthorized access to withdraw funds.

This vulnerability is a form of access control issue, as the check relies on `tx.origin` instead of using `msg.sender`, which is more secure in such cases.",1034,135,9.353143692016602
26,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `FibonacciBalance` contract's use of `delegatecall` to the `fibonacciLibrary` address in both `withdraw` and the fallback function. This is an access control vulnerability because `delegatecall` executes code in the context of the caller's contract, meaning that an attacker can potentially change the `fibonacciLibrary` address to point to a malicious contract, gaining control over the state of the `FibonacciBalance` contract, including variables like `calculatedFibNumber` and `withdrawalCounter`.",1450,110,7.667529821395874
27,unchecked low level calls,"YES. 

The vulnerability lies in the `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);` function in the `Pie` contract, which uses a low-level call without checking the return value. This can lead to potential issues, such as failing to handle errors correctly, as the return value of the `call()` is not being verified. Additionally, in the `Airdropper` contract, using a loop to send tokens without considering gas limits can cause the transaction to run out of gas, potentially leading to failure in execution.",1431,106,9.299288749694824
28,unchecked low level calls,"YES

It is vulnerable because the `send()` function is used in the `Delta` contract without checking for its return value. Specifically:

- Line 54: `owner2.send(sum2);`

These are low-level calls that do not check if the transfer was successful, leading to potential failures that are not handled, which could result in loss of funds or unwanted behavior.",1762,87,5.891942977905273
29,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability exists in the following part of the code:

In the **Freebie contract**:
- The `Command` function at line 39 uses `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);` without checking the return value of the low-level call. This can lead to vulnerabilities because the `call` function returns a boolean indicating success or failure, but this result is ignored. If the call fails, it will not stop the transaction or revert the state, which can lead to undesired behavior or fund loss.

In the **Airdropper contract**:
- There is no specific vulnerability related to unchecked low-level calls in the code provided. However, careful attention should be given to ensure the token address and recipient lists are validated, but this is outside the scope of the specific vulnerability type mentioned.",1339,168,10.9035804271698
30,unchecked low level calls,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the unchecked low-level calls, particularly the use of `send()` in multiple parts of the `KingOfTheEtherThrone` contract. As explained earlier, low-level calls like `send()` do not throw an error when they fail; instead, they return a boolean. In this case, the return values of these `send()` calls are not checked, making the contract vulnerable to failures without proper error handling.

The vulnerable lines are:
- `msg.sender.send(valuePaid);`
- `msg.sender.send(excessPaid);`
- `currentMonarch.etherAddress.send(compensation);`
- `wizardAddress.send(amount);`

The vulnerability is present in the `callnotchecked` function, where the return value of `callee.call()` is not checked. This is a low-level function call, and if the call fails, it will return `false` without reverting the transaction. This can lead to fail-open scenarios, where failures go unnoticed, allowing the contract to behave incorrectly.

Additionally, in the `multisend` function, there is a potential vulnerability because the `ERC20.transfer()` function's success is not checked. This can cause issues if the transfer fails silently.",1013,117,10.343029022216797

1. In the `Token` contract, the line `token.call(bytes4(sha3(""transfer(address,uint256)"")),to,amount);` does not check the return value of the low-level `call`. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the call fails, as execution will continue without reverting.

2. In the `TokenBank` contract, the line `_addr.call.value(_wei);` also uses a low-level call without checking if the call was successful. This can result in funds being deducted even if the transfer fails.

The smart contract code is vulnerable due to the presence of potential front-running attacks in the `claimReward` and `setReward` functions. Specifically:

1. **Front-running in `setReward` (line 23):** When `owner.transfer(reward)` is executed, miners or external users can observe the reward amount in pending transactions and attempt to manipulate the sequence of transactions by offering higher gas fees, allowing them to intercept the reward.

2. **Front-running in `claimReward` (line 31):** Similarly, the `msg.sender.transfer(reward)` function is vulnerable to front-running, as an attacker could see a claim being submitted and submit a competing transaction with higher gas fees, potentially stealing the reward before the original transaction completes.

These vulnerabilities allow malicious users to exploit the order of transaction execution by front-running, hence making the contract unsafe.",1164,175,10.883670568466187
74,front running,"YES. It is vulnerable because the `solve` function in the `FindThisHash` contract still contains the same line:

The contract is vulnerable to a ""Denial of Service"" (DoS) attack due to the possibility of exhausting the gas limit during the `insertNnumbers` function. This happens because the contract dynamically increases the length of the `array` in a loop, potentially causing an out-of-gas error as `array.length += 1` can lead to high gas consumption, especially with large input sizes.

Additionally, in the `Airdropper` contract, the `multisend` function can also lead to a denial of service if `dests.length` is large, as looping through many addresses and performing token transfers could run out of gas before completion.",1324,137,7.3017754554748535

If any of the `send` calls fail (for example, due to insufficient gas or a fallback function that reverts), the entire loop will stop, causing a denial of service. This means that a single failing address can block refunds to all others.

Additionally, in the `Airdropper` contract, there is no explicit vulnerability from a denial of service perspective in the code provided. However, the looping structure in `multisend` could potentially be inefficient for large arrays, which may lead to gas limit issues, but that is not necessarily classified as denial of service in this specific context.",1207,157,8.684328556060791

It is vulnerable due to the loop in the `multisend` function, where a large number of addresses in the `dests` array can result in high gas consumption, potentially causing the transaction to run out of gas and fail. This creates a denial of service for legitimate users.",1101,60,5.054842472076416
138,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` line in the `DosAuction` contract. This pattern can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that refuses to accept the funds or if the gas required to send the funds exceeds the gas limit. In such cases, the `bid()` function will revert, preventing other users from placing bids and effectively locking the auction.",1094,103,7.52326226234436
