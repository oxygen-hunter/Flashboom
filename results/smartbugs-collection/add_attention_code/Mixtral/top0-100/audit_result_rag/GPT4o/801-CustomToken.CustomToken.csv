92,bad randomness,"YES

The contract is vulnerable due to the use of predictable values for randomness, specifically in lines such as:

1. **Line 99**: `address seed1 = contestants[uint(block.coinbase) % totalTickets].addr;`
2. **Line 101**: `address seed2 = contestants[uint(msg.sender) % totalTickets].addr;`
3. **Line 103**: `uint seed3 = block.difficulty;`

These values (block.coinbase, msg.sender, block.difficulty) are either publicly accessible or influenced by miners, making them predictable or manipulable, compromising the randomness and security of the raffle.",2844,132,13.167171716690063
93,bad randomness,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `rand` function used in the `LuckyDoubler` contract. Similar to the previous code, the function relies on block information (`block.blockhash(lastBlockNumber)`) and deterministic variables to generate randomness. This method is susceptible to manipulation by miners, who can influence the outcome by selectively choosing certain block numbers, making the randomness predictable. This creates an attack vector where a malicious actor can exploit the predictability of the random number generation and unfairly benefit from the contract's behavior.",2982,105,16.56929039955139
94,bad randomness,NO,1412,1,4.697167158126831
95,bad randomness,"YES. The smart contract `GuessTheRandomNumberChallenge` is vulnerable due to the same issue with randomness. The line `answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));` uses block data (`blockhash` and `now`) as a source of randomness, which is predictable. This allows attackers to replicate the process and predict the random number, compromising the security of the contract.",1176,86,8.587873697280884
96,bad randomness,"YES, it is vulnerable because the randomness in the `RandomNumberGenerator` contract relies on predictable values such as `block.timestamp`, `block.number`, and `blockhash`, which are influenced by miners and are not truly random.

The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function, specifically in the line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())`. This code allows the use of a low-level call function that sends Ether to an external address without further checks, enabling a reentrancy attack. An attacker could use a fallback function to re-enter the `Collect` function and repeatedly withdraw funds before the contract state (`acc.balance`) is updated, draining the contract's funds.",1805,92,7.644010782241821

112,reentrancy,"YES. The vulnerability is in the `ReentrancyDAO` contract, specifically in the `withdrawAll` function. The call to `msg.sender.call.value(oCredit)()` on line 18 is a low-level call that allows external contracts to execute code and reenter the function before the state is updated. This reentrancy issue can be exploited if an attacker repeatedly calls `withdrawAll` to drain the contract’s funds before `credit[msg.sender] = 0;` is executed.",1185,100,10.216151237487793
113,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is present in the `withdrawBalance()` function of the `EtherBank` contract. Specifically, the issue arises due to the use of `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)()`. This allows for a reentrancy attack, as the external call to `msg.sender` is made before the contract's state (i.e., `userBalances[msg.sender] = 0`) is updated, giving attackers an opportunity to repeatedly call the `withdrawBalance()` function and drain the contract's funds before the balance is set to zero.",1174,117,8.758373260498047
114,reentrancy,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CashOut` function, specifically in this line:

116,reentrancy,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function of the `WALLET` contract. Specifically, the line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This line of code uses the low-level `call` function to send Ether to the caller (`msg.sender`). The issue is that this allows an external contract to re-enter the `Collect` function before the initial execution is complete, potentially draining funds from the contract. This is a classic reentrancy vulnerability, as the contract's state (`acc.balance`) is updated **after** the external call, which means an attacker could recursively call `Collect` and withdraw more funds than intended.",1631,137,7.1798646450042725
117,reentrancy,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance()` function of the `Reentrancy_cross_function` contract. The call to `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""")` in line 24 allows the external address (the caller) to re-enter the contract by calling another function (such as `withdrawBalance` again) before the original execution completes, exploiting the contract's state (such as the balance not being updated before the external call). This is a classic example of a reentrancy attack.",1217,107,12.292611360549927
118,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because the `withdrawBalance()` function in the `Reentrance` contract is susceptible to a reentrancy attack. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the line: 

```solidity

    throw;
}
```

This allows external calls to be made (using `msg.sender.call`) before the contract state (i.e., `userBalance[msg.sender] = 0;`) is updated.

It is vulnerable due to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `CashOut` function on the line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

Here, the external contract (or malicious contract) can call back into the `CashOut` function before the execution of the function is completed, allowing the attacker to withdraw funds repeatedly before the balance is updated.",1535,84,7.2150559425354
123,reentrancy,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function, which uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` to transfer funds.

124,reentrancy,"YES

The contract is vulnerable due to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability exists in the `CashOut` function, specifically at the line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This low-level call allows external contracts to execute their code before the current contract has completed its execution. Since the balance is only updated after the call, an attacker can exploit this by repeatedly calling the `CashOut` function to drain the contract's funds before the balance is updated, resulting in a reentrancy attack.",1521,109,13.601815700531006
125,reentrancy,"YES

It is vulnerable because of the potential for a reentrancy attack in the `Collect` function. Specifically, on line 54, the contract uses the low-level `call` function to send funds (`msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`) before updating the `balances` mapping. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the `Collect` function and drain funds before the balance is updated, exploiting the contract's vulnerability.",1675,87,8.318572521209717
126,reentrancy,"YES

The vulnerability in the contract still exists in the `Reentrancy_insecure` portion, specifically in the `withdrawBalance()` function. The reentrancy attack vulnerability occurs because the external call to `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""")` is made before the contract's state (`userBalances[msg.sender] = 0`) is updated. This allows the attacker to re-enter the contract and withdraw funds multiple times before the balance is reset.",1133,92,8.389266014099121
127,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability exists because the `isSaleFinished` function relies on `block.timestamp` to determine if the sale is finished. Since miners can manipulate the timestamp within a certain range, this introduces a potential time manipulation vulnerability.",1041,46,8.541114091873169
128,time manipulation,"YES

It is vulnerable because the contract still relies on `block.timestamp` (or `now`) for random number generation and decision-making, which can be manipulated by miners. Specifically:
- Line 13: The condition `if ( rand > 0 && now - rand > 24 hours )` can be influenced by the miner, allowing them to manipulate the outcome by altering the timestamp.
- Line 27: The function `randomGen()` returns `block.timestamp`, which is not a reliable source for randomness and can be exploited in the context of random number generation.

This exposes the contract to both time manipulation and bad randomness vulnerabilities.",1276,128,9.660772323608398
129,time manipulation,NO,1444,1,2.7737951278686523
130,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable because the same time manipulation vulnerability exists in the `Roulette` contract, specifically in lines 18 and 20 (`require(now != pastBlockTime);` and `pastBlockTime = now;`). The reliance on `now` (which is equivalent to `block.timestamp`) can be manipulated by miners to control when the balance transfer occurs, making the contract susceptible to exploitation.",1143,81,7.616106033325195
131,time manipulation,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable due to the use of `block.timestamp` in line 43: `var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;`. 

This is because the timestamp is manipulated by miners within a small range, making it possible for miners to influence the randomness in the contract. This vulnerability allows attackers to predict or manipulate the outcome of the randomness, which is crucial for the fairness of the game. The reliance on `block.timestamp` to generate random numbers can lead to malicious exploitation by miners or other participants.",1253,111,5.174586296081543
132,short addresses,NO,1301,1,4.046781539916992
133,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability exists in the `DosGas` contract, specifically in the `emptyCreditors()` function. If the length of `creditorAddresses` exceeds 1500, setting `creditorAddresses` to a new array with zero length will require a substantial amount of gas. This can potentially result in the function running out of gas, causing a denial of service as it prevents the `emptyCreditors()` function from successfully executing, thereby locking the contract in a state where it cannot clear its creditors. This could lead to a situation where no one is able to call this function due to the high gas cost required.",1269,126,10.589254140853882
134,denial of service,"YES, the contract is vulnerable due to a potential denial of service attack in the `insertNnumbers` function. The dynamic resizing of the array (`array.length += 1;`) in each iteration of the loop (lines 19-20) can lead to excessive gas consumption, making it possible for transactions to fail if the gas limit is reached.

It is vulnerable due to the same denial-of-service vulnerability present in the `Refunder` contract's `refundAll` function. Specifically, the `require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));` line can cause the entire function to fail if any recipient's address either consumes too much gas or deliberately fails to accept the refund. As a result, a single failure in sending will prevent all subsequent refunds from being processed.",1252,92,9.588257551193237
137,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `DosOneFunc` contract, specifically in the loop inside the `ifillArray()` function. The loop at lines 17-18 (`for(uint i=0;i<350;i++) { listAddresses.push(msg.sender); }`) can potentially cause a denial of service (DoS) due to exceeding the gas limit if the array grows too large, making the function execution expensive or impossible when gas constraints are met.

Additionally, there is no mechanism in place to limit the number of addresses pushed into the array over multiple transactions, increasing the risk of this DoS vulnerability.",1146,123,10.672607183456421
138,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability in the `DosAuction` contract still exists in the line:

```solidity
require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));
```

If the current frontrunner is a contract that has a fallback function which consumes all available gas or reverts the transaction, the `send` function will fail. This will prevent the new bidder from becoming the frontrunner, effectively causing a denial of service (DoS) to the auction, as no one else will be able to place bids.",1139,104,6.738980293273926
