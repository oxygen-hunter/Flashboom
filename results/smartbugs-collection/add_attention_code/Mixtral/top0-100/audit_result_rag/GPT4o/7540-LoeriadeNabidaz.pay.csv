There is no check to ensure only the owner can withdraw the funds, leading to an access control vulnerability where unauthorized users can drain the contract's balance.",1135,90,9.399027347564697
19,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the constructor function `Constructor()`. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, constructors are defined by a function with the same name as the contract.

26,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `delegatecall` in both the `withdraw` function and the fallback function (lines 31 and 38). Specifically:

1. **Line 31: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(fibSig, withdrawalCounter));`**
   - **Vulnerability**: The `delegatecall` allows the `FibonacciBalance` contract to execute code in the context of the `FibonacciLib` contract but with its own storage. If the `fibonacciLibrary` address can be changed or is not trusted, an attacker could exploit this by providing a malicious contract that executes arbitrary code with the privileges of the `FibonacciBalance` contract.

2. **Line 38: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(msg.data));`**
   - **Vulnerability**: This allows any external call to the contract to be forwarded to the `fibonacciLibrary` via `delegatecall` with the data provided by the caller. Since the caller controls `msg.data`, they could potentially manipulate it to execute unintended logic in the context of the `FibonacciBalance` contract, leading to a potential access control bypass or unauthorized operations.",1365,242,11.533406496047974

1. In the `pay()` function, once the counter `c` reaches 2, the contract's entire balance is transferred to the sender. Since the transaction order on the Ethereum blockchain can be manipulated by miners or other users offering higher gas fees, someone observing a transaction where `c` is about to reach 2 could front-run it by submitting their own transaction with a higher gas fee. This would allow the attacker to claim the balance before the original user.

2. Similar vulnerabilities exist in the `setReward()` and `claimReward()` functions, as found in the previous example. The use of `msg.sender.transfer(reward)` in these functions can also be front-run by a malicious actor who offers a higher gas fee to claim the reward ahead of the legitimate user.",1079,172,11.038486242294312
74,front running,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to a front-running attack. Specifically, the vulnerability is in the `solve` function, where the line `require(hash == sha3(solution));` exposes the solution to front-running. A malicious user can monitor the pending transactions on the blockchain, extract the solution from another user's transaction, and submit their own transaction with a higher gas fee to claim the reward of 1000 ether, preempting the original user.",1025,91,6.730605125427246
75,front running,"YES

The contract is vulnerable to front-running in the `pay()` function. Since the condition `c == 2` triggers a reward transfer (`msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);`), a malicious actor could observe when the counter `c` reaches 1 and then quickly submit a transaction with a higher gas fee to trigger the second `pay()` call. This would allow the attacker to claim the entire contract balance before the legitimate user completes their second transaction.",2099,92,5.917059421539307
76,front running,"YES

The second contract is still vulnerable to front-running attacks. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the **play** function, as in the first contract. When a player submits their move by calling the `play` function with a number, another player can observe this transaction in the mempool and submit their own transaction with higher gas fees to front-run the original player. They could potentially exploit this information to influence the outcome in their favor.

",1298,88,7.061923265457153
77,arithmetic,"YES

The vulnerability lies in line 22: `map[k] -= v;`. This line can cause an integer underflow if `v` is larger than `map[k]`, which could lead to unintended behavior since Solidity versions before 0.8.0 do not automatically check for arithmetic overflows or underflows.

Additionally, while not related to arithmetic underflow, the `pay()` function is also vulnerable to reentrancy attacks due to the `msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);` call before resetting `c = 0;`. This could allow an attacker to recursively call `pay()` and drain the contract balance.",868,127,9.848368167877197
78,arithmetic,"YES. 

The vulnerability still exists in the `run` function at line 21: `count *= input;`. This operation is prone to an integer overflow vulnerability, especially because Solidity versions prior to 0.8.x do not automatically check for overflows or underflows in arithmetic operations. If a large enough `input` value is provided, the multiplication could overflow, resulting in an incorrect or unintended value for `count`.

Additionally, the `pay` function introduces another vulnerability related to reentrancy. When the contract sends Ether to `msg.sender` using `msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);`, there is a risk of reentrancy if the `msg.sender` is a contract that could recursively call the `pay` function and manipulate the contract’s balance or state (specifically the `c` variable).",848,164,8.290498971939087

80,arithmetic,"YES. 

The vulnerability lies in the `run` function where the subtraction operation `count -= input` can lead to an integer underflow. In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, arithmetic operations do not automatically check for overflows or underflows, which can result in an incorrect value for `count` if `input` is greater than `count`, causing it to wrap around to a very large number. This can lead to unintended behavior in the contract.",848,96,6.149936676025391

The vulnerability exists in both the `pay` and `run` functions. Specifically, in the `run` function, the line `count -= input;` still presents the risk of an arithmetic underflow. If the `input` value is larger than the current `count`, it will result in an underflow, potentially causing an unintended large value for `count`. Additionally, the `pay` function may also have issues with unchecked arithmetic (`c = c + 1;`), though the primary vulnerability stems from the underflow in the `run` function.",932,120,6.927340269088745

88,arithmetic,"YES

The vulnerability in this contract is still related to arithmetic overflow. Specifically, in the `run` function, adding an unchecked `input` to `count` could result in an overflow if `input` is large enough. Since the Solidity version is `^0.4.19`, this version does not include automatic overflow/underflow checks, making it vulnerable to integer overflow attacks, similar to the original example.

Additionally, the variable `c` in the `pay` function could also be vulnerable to overflow as it increases without any overflow check, which could lead to unintended behavior.",848,119,5.696737766265869
89,arithmetic,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the same potential arithmetic overflow issue with the line:

```solidity

Since Solidity version 0.4.15 does not automatically handle arithmetic overflows, adding a large enough value to `sellerBalance` can cause an overflow, leading to unexpected behavior. Moreover, the variable `c = c + 1;` in the `pay()` function is also susceptible to overflow if the value of `c` exceeds the maximum value of a `uint` type.",865,110,8.992831707000732

The vulnerability lies in the same randomness generation mechanism in the second contract as it does in the first. The `rand()` function, which uses the previous block’s hash (`block.blockhash(lastBlockNumber)`) as a source of randomness, can be manipulated by miners. This makes it vulnerable to attacks where a malicious actor could influence the outcome by predicting or controlling the block hash. Thus, the contract's reliance on this pseudo-random value introduces a significant vulnerability.",2852,95,4.493875980377197
94,bad randomness,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the use of block number for randomness. Specifically, the line `bool won = (block.number % 2) == 0;` in the `makeBet()` function is vulnerable because the block number is predictable and can be influenced by miners. This allows attackers to predict or manipulate the outcome of the bet, compromising the fairness of the lottery system.

This can cause a denial of service if `msg.sender` is a contract with a fallback function that consumes too much gas or fails. If the transfer of funds fails due to insufficient gas or any malicious behavior of the recipient contract, it could block the execution of future payments, effectively causing a denial of service.",1139,85,5.329025506973267
134,denial of service,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability lies in the potential for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack in the `insertNnumbers` function. Specifically, the loop dynamically increases the array size during each iteration (`array.length += 1`), which can consume excessive gas, especially if a large number of elements are inserted. This can cause the transaction to fail due to running out of gas, effectively making the contract unusable. The dynamic resizing of the array in combination with a large number of iterations contributes to the vulnerability.",1239,110,7.0190184116363525
135,denial of service,"YES

The contract is vulnerable due to a potential denial of service (DoS) issue. Specifically, in the `lendGovernmentMoney` function, the use of `creditorAddresses = new address ;` and `creditorAmounts = new uint ;` (lines 46 and 48) could lead to loss of creditor data, and if the contract runs out of gas or funds during these operations, it could prevent further function execution. Moreover, improper handling of external calls (e.g., sending Ether to multiple addresses) can also introduce DoS risks if one of the recipients causes the transaction to fail.",2213,123,7.12298321723938
136,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `send` in the `refundAll` function. Specifically, the line:

```solidity
require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));
```

If any of the addresses in `refundAddresses` rejects the `send` (due to gas limit issues or other reasons), the entire `refundAll` function will fail. This leads to a denial of service because no other address will be refunded, as the entire loop stops when one `send` fails. This makes the contract vulnerable to being locked up by a single failing address.",1122,129,9.00055456161499
137,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is due to the same `for` loop in the `ifillArray` function, which can lead to a denial of service (DoS) by consuming excessive gas. Specifically, the loop iterates 350 times, pushing addresses into the `listAddresses` array. As the array grows in size, the gas required to execute the function increases, which could eventually exceed the block gas limit, preventing the function from being executed. This could cause the contract to become unusable, leading to a denial of service.",1016,114,7.697505474090576
138,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is due to the line:

```solidity
require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));
```

This introduces a potential denial of service (DoS) vulnerability because `send()` only forwards 2300 gas, and if the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that has a fallback function requiring more than 2300 gas to execute, the `send()` will fail. As a result, no other bidder can replace the frontrunner, effectively preventing new bids and halting the auction, creating a DoS situation.",1009,120,10.075801134109497
