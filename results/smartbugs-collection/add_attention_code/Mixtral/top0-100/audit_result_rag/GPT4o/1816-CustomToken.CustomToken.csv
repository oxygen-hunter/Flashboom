The vulnerability stems from the `missing()` function in the `Missing` contract.

The vulnerability lies in the function `initWallet()` in the `Wallet` contract.

The vulnerability exists in the `IntegerOverflowMappingSym1` contract's `init` function, specifically on the line:

If `map[k]` is smaller than `v`, the subtraction will wrap around, leading to a much larger value due to Solidity's behavior prior to version 0.8, where arithmetic operations did not check for overflows or underflows.

The vulnerability in this smart contract lies in the same potential issue of arithmetic overflows or underflows, specifically in the `increaseLockTime` function where an unsigned integer is involved (`lockTime[msg.sender] += _secondsToIncrease`).

This could allow attackers to manipulate the lock time in their favor.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` contract uses Solidity version 0.4.10, which also lacks overflow protection for arithmetic operations. The total supply or balances could be manipulated via an overflow, although no specific arithmetic operation in `CustomToken` triggers this directly in the provided code.",1200,172,14.742989540100098

The vulnerability arises due to the potential for integer overflows and underflows in the arithmetic operations in the `TokenSaleChallenge` contract. Specifically:

In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, integer arithmetic operations do not automatically check for overflows or underflows, meaning an attacker could manipulate the number of tokens to bypass this check.
  
- **Line 25**: `balanceOf[msg.sender] += numTokens;` can result in an overflow if `numTokens` is sufficiently large, allowing the attacker's balance to wrap around and potentially exploit the contract by creating large token balances.

- **Line 33**: `msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);` can also lead to an arithmetic overflow, which could result in unintended behavior, such as transferring incorrect amounts of ether or failing to properly reduce the balance.

Solidity uses unsigned integers (`uint`), so the expression `balances[msg.sender] - _value` can wrap around, causing an underflow before the check is made. If `balances[msg.sender]` is less than `_value`, it will underflow, wrapping around to a large value, which can lead to transferring more tokens than intended.

This is a form of DoS by gas exhaustion.",1370,165,8.422556161880493
135,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability in the first contract is related to the potential for a denial of service attack caused by resetting the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays with `new address ` and `new uint `, which can break the expected behavior of creditors receiving payouts if the contract is manipulated or runs out of gas when these arrays grow large. Additionally, this could result in an inability to process payouts, effectively locking the contract.",2344,89,7.224633455276489
136,denial of service,"YES

The `refundAll` function in the `Refunder` contract is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. Specifically, it uses the `send` method in the `require` statement, which only sends 2300 gas. If any of the recipient addresses has a fallback function requiring more gas or if the transaction to any recipient fails, the entire loop will stop, preventing the contract from refunding any further addresses. Thus, a single failure can block the whole refund process.",1253,98,8.803481578826904
137,denial of service,"YES. The contract is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the loop in the `ifillArray` function. The loop attempts to push 350 addresses into the `listAddresses` array in each call, which consumes a significant amount of gas. As the array grows, the gas required to execute this function increases. Eventually, this could exceed the gas limit, preventing the function from being executed and effectively locking the contract. This constitutes a Denial of Service attack.",1147,101,10.263499021530151
