In Solidity, `send()` only returns a boolean value, and if it fails, it doesn't automatically revert the transaction.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `send()` in several places in the contract (lines 110, 118, 132, and 174) without checking for the return values. The `send()` function in Solidity can fail, and when it does, it returns `false` without reverting the transaction.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the unchecked return values of low-level calls. Specifically:

1. **Line 44**: `token.call(bytes4(sha3(""transfer(address,uint256)"")), to, amount);`

2. **Line 97**: `_addr.call.value(_wei);`
   - Similarly, this uses a low-level call to transfer Ether. The return value is also not checked, which can lead to Ether not being transferred as expected if the call fails. This creates a vulnerability where funds can be locked or lost. 

Low-level functions like `call` do not revert the transaction if they fail, but instead return `false`. In both cases mentioned, the contract does not verify whether the operation succeeded, leading to potential fail-open vulnerabilities.",1756,206,10.44275951385498

This allows front-running attacks, where a malicious user can observe the correct solution in a pending transaction and submit their own transaction with higher gas fees, thus preempting the original transaction and stealing the reward. The additional function `zint_bytes32ToString` does not affect or mitigate this vulnerability.",1124,90,7.35213828086853
75,front running,"YES, because the `approve` function and the allowance mechanism are still present in the second contract. The vulnerability associated with front-running can still occur when a user approves a certain amount for a spender, and another transaction could intercept this, allowing a malicious actor to exploit the situation before the original transaction is executed. This creates a front-running risk similar to the one described for the previous contract.",2198,78,6.517653465270996
76,front running,"YES

It is vulnerable because the same front-running issue exists in the `play` function. As with the previous contract, the vulnerability is at lines 25 and 28 where players submit their moves. A malicious user can observe a pending transaction and submit the same transaction with a higher gas fee, ensuring their transaction is mined first, leading to front-running attacks.",1397,73,5.619945287704468
77,arithmetic,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to the potential for an arithmetic underflow in the `init` function at line 28, where `map[k] -= v;` is executed.

78,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because of the arithmetic overflow risk present in the `run(uint256 input)` function, specifically at the line `count *= input;`.

80,arithmetic,"YES

The vulnerability in the contract lies in the `run` function, where an arithmetic underflow can occur. Specifically, if the `input` value is greater than `count`, subtracting `input` from `count` will cause an underflow, resulting in a large unintended value due to how unsigned integers wrap around in Solidity versions before 0.8.0. This creates a vulnerability that can be exploited.",947,85,8.149459838867188

The vulnerability lies in the line:

```solidity

This operation can cause an integer underflow if `input` is greater than `count`. Since `count` is initialized to 1, if `input` is set to a value greater than 1, the subtraction will result in an underflow, which can lead to incorrect behavior of the contract.",1031,80,10.431158065795898
84,arithmetic,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the line:

This operation can lead to an integer underflow if the `input` value is greater than the `count` (which is initialized to 1). In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, underflows are not automatically detected, allowing `res` to wrap around and result in an unintended value. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the contract.",960,99,5.12797212600708
85,arithmetic,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in line 34: `count -= input;`.

may also cause an underflow without proper checks.",1158,120,8.485332727432251
88,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the same line as before, `count += input;`, which can still cause an integer overflow.

89,arithmetic,"YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in line 27:

The vulnerability still exists in the second smart contract. The line:

```solidity

92,bad randomness,"YES. The contract is vulnerable because it uses block-related values (e.g., `block.coinbase`, `block.difficulty`, and `block.number`) to generate randomness, which are predictable or can be influenced by miners.

This randomness is predictable because both `block.blockhash` and `now` (or `block.timestamp`) can be manipulated or predicted to some extent.

",1232,14,3.294992446899414

The vulnerability exists due to the use of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `Collect` function, which can be exploited for a reentrancy attack.
