11,access control,YES. The vulnerability lies in the **newOwner** function of the **MultiOwnable** contract. Any user can call the **newOwner** function to assign themselves or another address as an owner because there is no access control to restrict who can call this function. This allows an attacker to gain ownership of the contract by calling **newOwner** with their own address.,1229,75,6.668030261993408
12,access control,"YES. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient access control in the `missing()` function. The `missing()` function allows any user to become the contract owner by calling it, as there are no restrictions on who can execute it. This can lead to unauthorized users taking control of the contract and, combined with the `withdraw()` function, they could drain the contract's funds.

Additionally, the `LetsSuicide` contract uses `suicide()` to send funds to any specified address, which can be exploited to forcefully transfer Ether to the `Missing` contract, bypassing usual access checks.",967,118,7.028778553009033
13,access control,"YES

The vulnerability is present due to the improper access control in the `DynamicPyramid` function. This function is intended to be a constructor, but since Solidity version 0.4.15 does not use the constructor keyword, this allows anyone to call the `DynamicPyramid` function again after the contract is deployed. As a result, any user can become the `creator` and gain unauthorized access to functions that are restricted to the contract owner, such as `collectAllFees`, `collectFeesInEther`, and `changeOwner`.",2887,110,3.6726810932159424
14,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability arises from improper access control in the `withdraw` function of the `Wallet` contract. Specifically, in the following line:

```solidity
require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);
```

The condition should be checking whether `amount <= balances[msg.sender]` instead of `amount >= balances[msg.sender]`. This incorrect condition allows users to withdraw funds even when they do not have a sufficient balance, leading to potential loss of funds. Additionally, the `migrateTo` function can transfer the entire balance of the contract without further security checks, presenting another access control risk.",1084,124,8.609530925750732
15,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `IamMissing` function of the `Missing` contract, which allows anyone to set the owner of the contract. This is an access control issue, as it permits any user to call the function and become the owner, bypassing the intended ownership restrictions.

Additionally, the `LetsSuicide` contract calls the `suicide` function, allowing it to forcibly send Ether to the `LetsFuckingSuicide` address, which can be exploited if misused.",977,100,6.9881579875946045
16,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the lack of access control for the `set` function in the `Map` contract. Any external user can call the `set` function to modify the `map` array, which can lead to unauthorized changes to the contract's internal state. Additionally, in the `SuicideContract`, the `NukeContract` function creates a `LetsSuicide` contract that can forcefully send Ether to any specified address (`Russian`), potentially causing unintended consequences such as draining the contract's balance.",1042,105,7.131104469299316
17,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability arises from the usage of `delegatecall` in the `Proxy` contract without proper access control. This can allow an attacker to exploit the contract by passing in malicious logic, which will execute in the context of the `Proxy` contract, potentially leading to unauthorized control over contract state or funds.

In addition, the `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract` contracts present vulnerabilities as they allow the transfer of control over contract destruction using `suicide` (now `selfdestruct`), which can result in the loss of funds or other unintended consequences. The combination of `delegatecall` and `selfdestruct` mechanisms increases the risk of severe damage to the contract.",945,145,9.865529537200928
18,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability lies in the **lack of proper access control** for critical functions in the `Wallet` contract. Specifically:

1. **PushBonusCode** and **PopBonusCode** are public functions, allowing anyone to modify the `bonusCodes` array without any restriction, which could compromise the intended functionality.
  
2. The **PopBonusCode** function has an ineffective check: `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length);`. Since the length of an array is always non-negative, this condition is always true, making it meaningless. Furthermore, reducing the length of the array manually (`bonusCodes.length--`) is unsafe as it can cause unexpected behavior or loss of data if not properly managed.

3. The **Destroy** function is also vulnerable, as it allows the owner to self-destruct the contract, which could result in a denial of service if misused.",1138,183,9.669049263000488
19,access control,"YES, the vulnerability exists.

The vulnerability in the contract lies in the `Constructor` function. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, a function with the same name as the contract is treated as a constructor. However, in the provided code, the function is named `Constructor` with a capital ""C"", which does **not** match the contract name `Missing`. As a result, it is treated as a regular function, not a constructor.

This means the `owner` variable is never initialized to the contract deployer's address, leaving the contract vulnerable to anyone calling the `Constructor` function and setting themselves as the owner. Consequently, an attacker could take control of the contract and withdraw its balance using the `withdraw` function.

Additionally, the `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract` contracts involve the `suicide` function, which could be used to forcefully send Ether to the `Missing` contract, but this is secondary to the primary access control issue in the `Missing` contract.",967,207,11.945850610733032
20,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `initWallet()` function, which assigns the `creator` address, is publicly accessible. This means any user can call this function and assign themselves as the creator, thereby gaining control over the `migrateTo()` function, which allows transferring all the contract's balance to an arbitrary address. This creates an access control issue, allowing unauthorized users to exploit the contract.",1102,83,9.742065668106079
21,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability arises from the use of `tx.origin` for access control in the `sendTo` function. The `require(tx.origin == owner)` line can be exploited by an attacker who creates a malicious contract (like `SuicideContract`). By tricking the owner into interacting with the malicious contract, the attacker's contract can initiate a transaction where `tx.origin` still refers to the owner, thus bypassing the access control check. This allows unauthorized transfers of funds.

The `suicide` function in `LetsSuicide` further aggravates the issue by forcibly sending Ether to any address without its consent, making it easier for attackers to manipulate funds.",934,140,8.485800504684448
22,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability arises from the `refund()` function in the `Wallet` contract. This function allows anyone to withdraw all of their balance without any restrictions or proper access control. There is no verification of the userâ€™s relationship to the balance (e.g., requiring ownership or permissions). This creates a risk where any user with a balance in the contract can drain their entire funds without sufficient checks, potentially bypassing intended limitations on withdrawal behavior. Additionally, the ""migrateTo"" function relies solely on the creator, which can also lead to vulnerabilities if the creator's account is compromised.",1122,123,6.895378351211548
23,access control,"YES

The vulnerability arises due to a lack of proper access control in both the `SimpleSuicide` and `LetsSuicide` contracts. Specifically:

- In `SimpleSuicide`, the function `sudicideAnyone()` allows **anyone** to trigger `selfdestruct(msg.sender)`, transferring all contract funds to the caller without restriction.
  
- In `LetsSuicide`, the constructor immediately calls `suicide(LetsFuckingSuicide)` upon deployment, sending the contract's balance to the provided address. This could be abused if the constructor is called by an unauthorized user.

Both contracts fail to implement proper access control, allowing malicious actors to destruct contracts and transfer funds.",893,139,10.149211168289185
24,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability lies in the `changeOwner` function, which lacks any access control modifiers such as `onlyowner`. This allows anyone to call the function and change the owner of the contract, which is an access control issue. Additionally, the `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract` contracts present further vulnerabilities, as they allow the use of the `suicide` (now `selfdestruct` in newer versions) function, which transfers all contract funds to the specified address without proper checks or restrictions. These are critical security issues related to access control.",974,122,8.588761806488037
25,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `tx.origin` for access control. Specifically, in the `Phishable` contract's `withdrawAll` function, it checks if `tx.origin == owner`. This method of validating the caller is insecure because `tx.origin` refers to the original external account that initiated the transaction, even across multiple contract calls. 

In this case, an attacker can create another contract (such as `SuicideContract` and `LetsSuicide`) that initiates the call to `Phishable` on behalf of the victim. Since `tx.origin` would still be the victimâ€™s address, the `require(tx.origin == owner)` check would pass, allowing the attacker to withdraw the funds.",952,152,10.891908407211304
26,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the use of `delegatecall` on the untrusted `fibonacciLibrary` contract in lines 31 and 38. This allows an attacker to control the execution context of the `FibonacciBalance` contract, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of the contract's state. Additionally, `delegatecall` can be exploited if the library contains malicious or unsafe code, as it executes in the context of the calling contract, exposing internal storage and balance.",1368,102,7.911423921585083
27,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The vulnerability exists in the use of the low-level `call` function in the `Command` function of the `Pie` contract. As described earlier, low-level functions like `call` do not throw an error if they fail; instead, they return a boolean value that must be checked to determine success or failure. In this contract, the return value of `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)` is not checked, which introduces a risk of failed calls not being detected, potentially leading to unwanted behavior.

Additionally, the `LetsSuicide` contract uses the `suicide` (now `selfdestruct`) function, which forcefully transfers the contract's balance to an address, potentially draining funds from the `Pie` contract if this mechanism is exploited.

Hence, the contract is vulnerable.",1349,162,10.811235189437866
28,unchecked low level calls,"YES

It is vulnerable because the code uses low-level calls like `send()` in lines 54 and 65 without checking the return values. These calls may fail, and since the return values are not checked, it can lead to loss of funds or unexpected contract behavior. Specifically, `owner2.send(sum2)` and `owner.send(balance)` do not handle potential failures, which is a common vulnerability in Solidity.",1680,84,5.337558746337891
29,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The vulnerability in the given smart contract lies in the usage of the low-level `call` function in the `Command` function (line 39). The return value of `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)` is not checked, which is risky because if the call fails, it will not revert the transaction, leading to potential security risks, such as unwanted outcomes or loss of funds.

Additionally, the `LetsSuicide` contract uses the `suicide` function (now known as `selfdestruct` in modern Solidity), which can forcefully send Ether to any address, including potentially vulnerable contracts like `Freebie`. This can drain or disrupt the `Freebie` contract, exposing it to further vulnerabilities related to uncontrolled contract interactions.",1257,151,12.330638885498047
30,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The contract is vulnerable because it uses the `send` function in several places (lines 110, 118, 132, and 174) without checking the return value. The `send` function can fail, and when it does, the contract continues execution without reverting the state, which can lead to inconsistencies or unintended outcomes.

Moreover, the `LetsSuicide` contract uses the `suicide` function (or `selfdestruct` in modern Solidity versions), which can forcefully send Ether to the target address, bypassing the control of the `KingOfTheEtherThrone` contract. This makes the contract susceptible to attacks that manipulate the state and Ether balance.",2546,140,7.671841621398926
31,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of low-level `call()` in the `airPort` contract (line 17) without checking its return value. Low-level `call()` returns a boolean value indicating success or failure, and failing to check this return value can allow the function to continue execution even if the call fails. This could result in unexpected behavior or security issues, such as failing to transfer tokens properly, leading to a potential loss of funds or incomplete transactions.

The second part involving the `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract` contracts also introduces potential security issues with self-destruction via the `suicide()` function. However, the focus of the vulnerability based on the description remains with the unchecked low-level call in the `airPort` contract.",1033,161,8.969044208526611
32,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The vulnerability in the second contract lies in its usage of low-level `send` calls without checking return values, as well as the potential issues arising from the `LetsSuicide` contract. Specifically:

1. **Unchecked `send` Calls**: The `send` function, used in lines such as `winner.send(subpot)` and `msg.sender.send(msg.value - value)`, does not check whether the transfer was successful. This can lead to funds not being transferred as expected, creating a vulnerability for failed transfers.
  
2. **LetsSuicide Contract**: The `LetsSuicide` contract uses the `suicide` (now known as `selfdestruct`) function to forcefully send funds to an address. This can potentially disrupt the state of contracts like Lotto if they are not prepared to handle arbitrary incoming funds.

Thus, this combination makes the contract vulnerable.",2672,179,13.960594415664673

The vulnerability lies in the unchecked low-level calls, specifically in the `callnotchecked` function:

```solidity

As mentioned before, low-level calls in Solidity, such as `call()`, do not propagate errors and return a boolean value. If the return value is not checked, it can lead to vulnerabilities, such as failing to detect whether the call was successful or not. In this case, if `callee.call()` fails, the transaction continues, which can result in unintended outcomes, such as loss of funds.

Additionally, the `suicide()` function (used in `LetsSuicide`) is another vulnerability as it is used to forcefully transfer contract balance to a specific address.

Specifically, in lines such as `extra[0].call.value(_share).gas(800000)();` and `target[0].call.value(msg.value).gas(600000)();`, the return values of these low-level `call()` functions are not checked. If these calls fail, they will return `false`, but the contract will continue executing, potentially leading to a loss of funds or other unintended behavior.

40,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of unchecked low-level calls in the `execute` function of the `Owned` contract and the `suicide`/`selfdestruct` functions in `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract`. Specifically:

1. **Unchecked Low-Level Call in `execute` function**: 
   The line `_dst.call.value(_value)(_data);` does not check the return value of the low-level `call`, which is prone to failure without reverting the execution. If the call fails, the transaction will continue without halting or throwing an error, potentially leading to unexpected or insecure behavior.

2. **Usage of `suicide` (aka `selfdestruct`)**:
   The `LetsSuicide` contract uses the `suicide` function, sending the contract's funds to the specified address (`LetsFuckingSuicide`) without performing any checks. The `suicide` function can be used maliciously to transfer contract balance, destroy the contract, and manipulate the state. If the receiving address (`LetsFuckingSuicide`) is not controlled properly, it can result in fund loss or security breaches.

The contract uses the low-level `call()` function in the `Command` function (line 44), which does not check the return value for success or failure. This can lead to unexpected behavior, as low-level calls like `call()`, `delegatecall()`, and `send()` do not automatically revert on failure and only return a boolean value.

The contract is vulnerable because it uses low-level calls without checking the return values. Specifically, in the `Command` function of the `FreeEth` contract, the `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)` is called without verifying if the call was successful. This can result in a failed operation without reverting the transaction, leading to potential issues like the contract behaving incorrectly or funds being lost.

Additionally, the `LetsSuicide` contract uses the `suicide` (or `selfdestruct`) function, which transfers all the contract's Ether to a specified address, potentially causing unintended behaviors if misused.

This is a common vulnerability in Solidity involving low-level calls.

Additionally, in the `WithdrawToHolder` function, `addr.call.value(_wei)()` is another unchecked low-level call, where if the transfer fails, it won't revert, leaving the contract state inconsistent.

Additionally, the `suicide()` function in the `LetsSuicide` contract and its interaction with the `SuicideContract` introduce further risks. Specifically, the `suicide()` function sends all of the contract's balance to the provided address without any safety checks, which can result in unintentional or malicious transfer of funds.

fuck.call(bytes4(sha3(""giveBlockReward()"")));
```

Since the return value of the `call()` function is not checked, if the call fails (e.g., the target function does not exist, or there is an error during execution), the execution will not revert, and the contract will proceed as if the call succeeded. This can lead to unintended behaviors, such as failing silently and not providing the intended rewards, which is a significant vulnerability.

Additionally, the `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract` can introduce vulnerabilities related to forced ether transfers and contract destruction via the `suicide()` function. These can result in ether being sent to unintended addresses without their consent or proper checks.",1049,170,9.268316745758057
57,unchecked low level calls,"YES. The contract is vulnerable due to the use of unchecked low-level calls in both the `Proxy` contract and the `SuicideContract`. Specifically:

1. **Unchecked `call` in `Proxy` contract**: In the `Proxy` contract, line `target.call.value(msg.value)(data);` does not check the return value of the `call`. This can lead to scenarios where the low-level call fails but the execution continues without reverting, which could result in unintended behavior or loss of funds.

2. **`suicide` in `LetsSuicide`**: The `LetsSuicide` contract calls `suicide(LetsFuckingSuicide);`, which transfers all the contract's Ether to the specified address and destroys the contract. This could be used maliciously to send funds to any arbitrary address without proper control, leading to potential vulnerabilities in handling funds.

These vulnerabilities can be exploited, especially when combined with the lack of checks on return values from low-level calls.",1257,200,11.10382866859436
58,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The vulnerability in the provided code lies in the unchecked low-level `call()` function in the `airdrop` contract, specifically at this line:

```solidity
caddress.call(id, from, _tos[i], v);
```

This low-level call does not check the return value, meaning that even if the `call()` fails, the contract will continue to execute. This can lead to vulnerabilities such as fund loss, as the function does not handle potential errors from the external contract's execution.

Additionally, the `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract` contracts introduce further risks. These contracts can forcefully transfer ether or destroy contracts, which, combined with the unchecked `call()`, can lead to serious exploitation scenarios like draining the contract's funds or breaking contract logic.",1037,160,10.7611825466156
59,unchecked low level calls,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);` line of the `WhaleGiveaway2` contract, which is a low-level call without checking the return value. This can lead to a fail-open scenario if the call fails. Additionally, the use of the `suicide` function in the `LetsSuicide` contract can forcefully transfer the contract's balance to another address, potentially leading to an unintended balance drain if exploited. The `suicide` function also makes the `SuicideContract` vulnerable as it enables forced transfer of funds without proper security checks.",1409,122,10.299505233764648
60,unchecked low level calls,"YES. The smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is present in the **use of low-level calls and unchecked return values**. In particular:

1. In the `Caller` contract, the line `a.call();` uses the low-level function `call()`, which, as mentioned, does not propagate errors and returns a boolean value indicating success or failure. This return value is not checked, so any failure in the external contract execution would not be detected, potentially leading to unintended outcomes.
  
2. The `suicide()` function used in the `LetsSuicide` contract can forcefully transfer the contract's balance to the specified address (`LetsFuckingSuicide`). It is combined with the unchecked low-level call in the `SuicideContract`. If `Russian` is a contract that fails, the low-level call won't revert the transaction, and any error will be ignored. This is dangerous and makes the system prone to security issues.

Thus, the contracts are vulnerable due to the unchecked use of low-level calls.",884,207,10.944680213928223

Specifically, in the functions `callFirstTarget()`, `callSecondTarget()`, and `winPrize()`, the use of `call.value()` does not check for the success or failure of the call. If these low-level calls fail, they will not revert the transaction and could leave the contract in an unexpected state, leading to potential vulnerabilities such as denial of service or improper fund transfers.",2200,101,7.634654521942139

The smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of low-level calls without checking their return values, specifically the `call()` function in the `EtherGet` contract. The `addr.call.value(0 wei)();` line can fail, and because the return value is not checked, the contract will not handle the failure properly. This can lead to fail-open scenarios and other unintended consequences. Additionally, the `suicide()` function in the `LetsSuicide` contract can be exploited to forcefully send Ether to an address, which could be used maliciously.",1135,118,7.0955188274383545

The vulnerability lies in the use of low-level calls, specifically in `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)` within the `Command` function. Low-level calls like `call()` do not throw exceptions on failure but return a boolean value, which is not checked in the provided code. If the call fails, the contract will continue execution without handling the failure, which can lead to unwanted behavior such as the loss of funds or other unintended consequences.

Additionally, the `suicide()` function in the `LetsSuicide` contract allows an external contract to forcibly transfer its balance to another contract, which can be exploited if proper checks and balances are not implemented. This can potentially drain the balance of the `MultiplicatorX3` contract by exploiting its logic.",1109,158,10.920231342315674

Specifically, in line 17, the code uses `caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],_value)` without checking the return value of the call. Since `call()` returns a boolean value indicating success or failure, failing to check this result can lead to vulnerabilities such as unexpected failure of fund transfers or execution, which can be exploited.

Additionally, the `suicide()` function in the `LetsSuicide` contract is dangerous, as it allows the transfer of all contract funds to the specified address without proper validation. Combining this with the unchecked `call()` creates a potential attack vector.",1076,141,10.534094333648682

The contract is vulnerable due to the use of unchecked low-level `call()` functions that do not check for the success or failure of the call. Specifically:

1. **Line 44**: `token.call(bytes4(sha3(""transfer(address,uint256)"")),to,amount);`  
   This low-level call does not check if the `transfer` operation was successful, potentially leading to unintended behavior or fund loss if the call fails.

2. **Line 97**: `_addr.call.value(_wei);`  
   This is another low-level call that sends Ether, but again, the return value is not checked. If the call fails, it may still reduce the balance in `Holders[_addr]`, causing a loss of funds without completing the transfer.

67,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is related to unchecked low-level calls. Specifically, in the `Command` function of the `HomeyJar` contract, the use of `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)` does not check the return value. If the call fails, the contract will not revert, which can lead to failed transactions without the sender realizing it. This kind of unchecked low-level call can result in fail-open scenarios where an error occurs, but the contract continues execution, possibly leading to unexpected or undesired behavior.",1345,109,7.963382244110107

This can lead to a vulnerability where, if the call fails (e.g., due to insufficient gas or other issues), the balance will still be set to 0, causing a loss of funds for the user without the withdrawal actually occurring. Furthermore, since no error handling is implemented, the contract is exposed to potential misuse or exploitation.

Additionally, the `suicide()` function in the `LetsSuicide` contract could be used to forcibly send Ether to any arbitrary address, which could interfere with the logic of the `keepMyEther` contract, further increasing the attack surface.",986,181,9.63987922668457

The vulnerability lies in the use of low-level `call` (in the `proxy` function) and the `suicide` (or `selfdestruct`) mechanism in `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract`. In particular:

1. **Unchecked Return Value**: The low-level `call` in the `proxy` function does not check the return value, which can lead to fail-open scenarios. If `target.call.value(msg.value)(data)` fails, the transaction does not revert, potentially leading to unwanted outcomes.

2. **Suicide Mechanism**: The `suicide` function (now renamed `selfdestruct` in newer Solidity versions) in `LetsSuicide` can send funds to any arbitrary address, and because it's executed within the `NukeContract` function, it could potentially lead to unauthorized transfers or malicious behavior.

Both of these factors combined make the contract vulnerable.",1257,190,12.577171802520752

74,front running,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is related to the ""front-running"" attack in the `FindThisHash` contract. Since the `solve` function checks the solution using `sha3(solution)` and then transfers funds to the sender, a malicious actor can monitor the pending transaction pool, copy the correct solution, and issue a higher gas fee to preempt the original transaction, thus stealing the reward.

The vulnerability is due to the potential for front-running attacks in the `play()` function. Since the Ethereum blockchain is public, an attacker can observe a player's transaction as it is being broadcasted and then submit their own transaction with a higher gas fee, preempting the original transaction. Specifically, this could happen when the second player tries to submit their number in the game (line 28). An attacker could monitor the first player's number and strategically submit their transaction with a favorable number, ensuring they win. This is a classic case of a front-running vulnerability.",1301,121,9.352906227111816
77,arithmetic,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the use of the subtraction operation on a mapping value without checking for underflow. In the `init` function of `IntegerOverflowMappingSym1`, the expression `map[k] -= v` can cause an underflow if `v` is greater than `map[k]`. Since Solidity version 0.4.11 does not automatically handle underflows, this can lead to an unintended large value being assigned to `map[k]`, creating a serious security risk.",871,100,5.452908992767334

The first contract `IntegerOverflowMul` contains the same vulnerability as previously identified: an arithmetic overflow vulnerability in line 17 (`count *= input;`). This can lead to an integer overflow if `input` is large enough, potentially causing unintended behavior in the contract.

Additionally, the `LetsSuicide` contract in combination with the `SuicideContract` introduces a vulnerability related to the `suicide` function (now called `selfdestruct` in newer Solidity versions). This function allows the contract to send its remaining Ether to any specified address and destroy the contract. This can be used maliciously to drain funds from the contract or attack other contracts that rely on the contract's existence.

Thus, both contracts are vulnerable due to arithmetic overflow and the use of `suicide`.",851,158,9.526305437088013
79,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability comes from the first contract `Overflow_Add`, where arithmetic overflows can occur at the line `balance += deposit;`. Since Solidity version 0.4.25 does not automatically check for overflow conditions, adding a large enough value to `balance` could cause an overflow, resulting in unexpected behavior such as a reset of the balance to a very low number. 

In the `LetsSuicide` contract, using `suicide` (now `selfdestruct` in newer versions) is dangerous as it transfers the contract's balance to the given address.

The vulnerability lies in the `count -= input;` operation in the `IntegerOverflowMinimal` contract. This is an **integer underflow** vulnerability. In Solidity versions before 0.8.0, when performing arithmetic operations, underflows (and overflows) are not checked.

The smart contract is vulnerable due to potential issues with integer overflow/underflow, specifically in the same locations as the previously identified code. Additionally, the use of the `suicide` function (or `selfdestruct` in later versions of Solidity) in the `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract` allows for malicious behavior, where ether can be forcibly sent to the `TokenSaleChallenge` contract.

The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in the same arithmetic issue (`count -= input`) from the original contract, as well as an additional issue in the `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract` contracts.

This combination of vulnerabilities could be exploited for malicious purposes such as fund theft or denial of service.",935,105,8.033795833587646
84,arithmetic,"YES, the contract is vulnerable due to the presence of an arithmetic underflow in the `IntegerOverflowBenign1` contract.

In the function `run(uint256 input)`, the line `uint res = count - input;` can cause an underflow if `input` is greater than `count` (which is initialized to 1). Since `count` is an unsigned integer (uint), subtracting a larger value (`input`) from a smaller one (`count`) will wrap around and result in an unexpectedly large value, causing an underflow.",864,112,7.461528778076172

The smart contract is vulnerable due to the same arithmetic vulnerabilities (integer overflows and underflows) as described in the previous code. Additionally, the `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract` introduce another vulnerability: the `suicide` function (now called `selfdestruct` in newer Solidity versions) can be exploited to forcefully destroy the contract and transfer its balance to a specified address. This can lead to unauthorized fund transfers or destruction of the contract, which is a significant security risk.",1165,103,7.274879455566406
87,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `Token` contract due to the potential for arithmetic underflow, similar to the earlier issue. Specifically:

1. In the `transfer` function, the line:
   ```solidity
   require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
   ```
   This check does not prevent underflows because subtraction (`balances[msg.sender] - _value`) is performed first. If `_value` is greater than `balances[msg.sender]`, this will underflow and bypass the intended check.

2. Similarly, the line:
   ```solidity
   balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
   ```
   If an underflow occurs, this would result in the balance of `msg.sender` becoming a very large number (due to underflow behavior in Solidity versions prior to 0.8).

These issues could be exploited to transfer more tokens than the sender holds, leading to potential theft of tokens or disruption of the contract's intended functionality.",1062,205,11.924145221710205
88,arithmetic,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `IntegerOverflowAdd` contract, specifically in the same line: `count += input;`. The code is vulnerable to integer overflow, as it uses a version of Solidity (`^0.4.19`) that does not have built-in checks for overflows and underflows. If a large enough `input` is provided, the value of `count` can overflow, leading to incorrect or malicious behavior.

Additionally, in the `SuicideContract`, the function `NukeContract` can forcefully destroy a contract by invoking the `suicide` function from `LetsSuicide`, allowing funds to be transferred to any arbitrary address, which could be dangerous if misused.",851,143,7.7000274658203125
89,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is due to the potential for integer overflow in the `Overflow` contract at the line `sellerBalance += value;`. Since Solidity version 0.4.15 does not include automatic overflow/underflow protection, adding large values to `sellerBalance` could cause an overflow. This means the `sellerBalance` could wrap around to a much smaller number than expected, allowing unintended behavior.

Additionally, in the `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract`, the `suicide` function (now deprecated and replaced by `selfdestruct`) is used, which can be risky because it allows a contract to forcefully send all its Ether balance to any address. This can lead to denial-of-service attacks if the receiving address is unable to handle the funds, although this isn't an arithmetic issue, it's still a security concern in practice.",868,178,9.35360836982727
90,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability still lies in the same area as in the first contract, specifically the line `balanceOf[_to] += _value;`. Since this code uses Solidity version `^0.4.10`, it lacks built-in protection against arithmetic overflows and underflows. If the `_value` added to `balanceOf[_to]` exceeds the maximum value that a `uint256` can hold, it will wrap around and cause an overflow, leading to potential loss of funds or misallocation of balances.

Additionally, the suicide function in the `LetsSuicide` contract poses a significant security risk. It can cause a transfer of all contract funds to the specified address (`LetsFuckingSuicide`) without any further checks or restrictions, which could lead to unauthorized fund transfer or contract self-destruction.",926,171,11.317180156707764
91,bad randomness,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the use of the `blockhash()` function in the `settle()` function of the `PredictTheBlockHashChallenge` contract. As explained earlier, blockhash values are predictable to some extent and can be influenced by miners. A malicious miner can manipulate the block hash to match the guess, allowing them to win unfairly by making the outcome of the randomness dependent on a value they can influence. This vulnerability still exists in the code provided.",1157,95,9.523273706436157
92,bad randomness,"YES. The vulnerability in this contract stems from the reliance on predictable values for randomness, particularly in the `chooseWinner` function. Specifically:

- `block.coinbase` (line 99), `msg.sender` (line 101), and `block.difficulty` (line 103) are all public and/or miner-influenced values, making them predictable or manipulable. This predictability undermines the security of the randomness, allowing an attacker to influence or predict the outcome of the raffle, thus compromising the integrity of the contract. 

Additionally, the use of `suicide` in the `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract` contracts presents another risk, as it allows for forced transfer of Ether, which could be exploited in certain scenarios.",2717,154,9.152728796005249
93,bad randomness,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the use of the `rand` function, which relies on the previous block hash (`block.blockhash(lastBlockNumber)`) to generate randomness. This value can be predicted or manipulated by miners, making it insecure for generating random outcomes. As a result, attackers could exploit this predictability to manipulate the outcome of the random selection, leading to unfair advantages in the payout mechanism.",2855,81,7.143869876861572
94,bad randomness,"YES

The given smart contract is vulnerable for the following reasons:

1. **Insecure Randomness**: The original vulnerability involving randomness is still present. The use of `block.number % 2` in the `makeBet()` function as a way to determine the outcome (`won` variable) is insecure. The block number can be influenced by miners, making this randomness predictable and allowing for possible exploitation by users who can control the outcome of bets.

2. **Selfdestruct Vulnerability**: The `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract` introduce another vulnerability. These contracts make it possible for an external actor to forcefully send Ether to the `Lottery` contract using the `suicide` (now known as `selfdestruct`) function. This can cause unintended Ether transfers that bypass the logic of the `Lottery` contract, potentially leading to unexpected states or balances, and could disrupt the intended functionality of the contract.",1285,189,5.970767021179199
95,bad randomness,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to its use of the `keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now)` to generate the random number. The vulnerability arises because both the block hash and the current timestamp (`now`) can be predicted or influenced by a malicious miner. As a result, an attacker can replicate the same ""random"" value used to set `answer`, allowing them to correctly guess the number and drain the contract. Additionally, the `LetsSuicide` contract can forcefully send funds to the vulnerable contract, further complicating its security.",1049,116,7.26562237739563
96,bad randomness,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable due to the following reasons:

1. **Predictable Randomness (Lines 12, 18, 20, 22)**:
   - The contract uses `block.timestamp` (line 12) as the initial salt for randomness, which is predictable and can be influenced by miners.
   - The calculation of `y` (line 18) involves `block.number` and a modulus operation on the salt, making it further predictable.
   - The `seed` (line 20) is calculated using `block.number` and the predictable value of `salt % 300` along with `y`.
   - The use of `blockhash(seed)` (line 22) is flawed because `blockhash` can only access hashes of the most recent 256 blocks, making it predictable.

2. **Suicide Attack (Lines 28, 33)**:
   - The `LetsSuicide` contract (line 28) can be used to self-destruct and send all its Ether balance to a specified address upon deployment.
   - The `SuicideContract` (line 33) creates a new instance of `LetsSuicide` and sends Ether to the specified address (`Russian`). This can lead to unexpected loss of funds and unintended contract self-destruction.",1100,267,14.612123727798462

This is a classic example of a reentrancy vulnerability.",1076,91,8.947224378585815
101,reentrancy,"YES, it is vulnerable because the `withdraw` function in the `SimpleDAO` contract contains a reentrancy vulnerability.

The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function, specifically in the line: 

```solidity

This allows an external contract to perform a reentrancy attack by making recursive calls to `Collect` before the previous execution completes, potentially draining the contractâ€™s funds before the balance is updated.",1678,71,6.255985498428345
104,reentrancy,"YES, the contract is vulnerable due to a **reentrancy attack** possibility.

In the function `getFirstWithdrawalBonus`, after increasing the `rewardsForA[recipient]` by 100, the contract calls `withdrawReward(recipient)`. During this call, external contracts (like a malicious one) can make recursive calls back into the `getFirstWithdrawalBonus` function before `claimedBonus[recipient]` is set to `true`. This allows the attacker to repeatedly claim rewards before the contract state is properly updated, draining funds.",1141,111,7.800283908843994
105,reentrancy,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable due to a reentrancy attack at line 63: 
```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This is because `msg.sender.call` sends Ether to an external address without properly updating the contract's internal state before making the call. An attacker can exploit this by creating a contract that calls `Collect` repeatedly before the balance is updated, allowing them to drain funds from the contract in a reentrancy attack.",1672,98,7.431654691696167
106,reentrancy,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the use of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` within the `Collect` function. This low-level `call` method sends ether to `msg.sender` without properly updating the contract's state (i.e., `balances[msg.sender] -= _am;`) before the external call. An attacker can exploit this by re-entering the contract and repeatedly withdrawing funds before the balance is updated, draining the contract of its ether.",1632,105,9.812259197235107
107,reentrancy,"YES. The contract is vulnerable due to the reentrancy issue in the `Collect` function, where it calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. This allows an external contract to reenter the `Collect` function and drain the contract's funds before the original execution completes, making it susceptible to a reentrancy attack.",1512,68,6.51458477973938
108,reentrancy,"YES. It is vulnerable because the contract `TokenBank` contains a potential reentrancy attack at line 94: `if(_addr.call.value(_wei)())`. This uses a low-level call to transfer Ether, which allows an external contract to execute code before the completion of the initial transaction. An attacker could exploit this by repeatedly calling the contract and draining funds before the balance is updated, leading to a reentrancy attack.",1598,88,7.921397686004639
109,reentrancy,"YES

It is vulnerable because the `airDrop()` function allows a reentrancy attack through the `supportsToken` modifier. The `supportsToken()` function in the `attack` contract calls `airDrop()` again before the first execution is completed. This allows an attacker to bypass the `hasNoBalance` check and call `airDrop()` multiple times, exploiting the vulnerability to increase their token balance repeatedly.",1283,83,5.670958042144775
110,reentrancy,"YES. The vulnerability in this contract is due to the same reentrancy attack as in the first code. Specifically, the line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())` in the `CashOut` function allows an external call to `msg.sender` without updating the contractâ€™s state (i.e., `balances[msg.sender] -= _am`) before the call is made.

112,reentrancy,"YES. The vulnerability exists due to the use of `msg.sender.call.value(oCredit)()` in the `withdrawAll` function. This line allows for reentrancy attacks, as the external call to `msg.sender` can trigger another call to `withdrawAll` before the contract's state (i.e., updating the `credit` mapping and balance) is fully updated. This can result in multiple withdrawals of the same funds before the contract recognizes the state change, making the contract vulnerable to reentrancy.",1058,103,10.660921812057495
113,reentrancy,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `EtherBank` contract, which can be exploited for a reentrancy attack. The contract first sends funds to the caller using `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)()`, and only after that does it update the balance of the caller (`userBalances[msg.sender] = 0`).

It is vulnerable because the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `CashOut` function allows for a reentrancy attack. The external call to `msg.sender` happens before the contract's state is updated (`balances[msg.sender]-=_am`), meaning an attacker can repeatedly call the `CashOut` function and drain the contract's balance before the balance is correctly updated.",1418,81,5.896800994873047
115,reentrancy,"YES

It is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `CashOut` function where the code:

```solidity

This can lead to a reentrancy attack, allowing an attacker to drain the contract's funds.",1090,98,6.560229063034058
118,reentrancy,"YES. The vulnerability exists due to the same issue as described earlier in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrance` contract. The use of `msg.sender.call.value()` allows reentrancy, where an attacker could repeatedly withdraw funds before the contract's balance is updated (i.e., before `userBalance[msg.sender] = 0` is executed).

Since the contract updates the balance only after the call, an attacker can drain funds by repeatedly calling this function before the balance is updated.",1548,83,7.564413547515869
126,reentrancy,"YES. The provided smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. Specifically, in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract, the caller's code is executed when `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""")` is used (line 17). This allows the caller to potentially re-enter the contract and call `withdrawBalance` again before the contract finishes updating the `userBalances` mapping. This can result in draining funds before the balance is set to zero.",1006,103,7.3920228481292725
127,time manipulation,"YES. The contract is vulnerable because it relies on `block.timestamp` in the `isSaleFinished()` function. As explained, miners have some control over the reported time, which can be manipulated to influence the contract's behavior, such as prematurely finishing the sale or extending it. This is a form of time manipulation vulnerability.",914,65,4.624864339828491
128,time manipulation,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The first vulnerability is the reliance on `block.timestamp` for randomness generation (line 27). As explained, the miner can manipulate `block.timestamp`, which makes the randomness predictable and exploitable, especially in scenarios like lotteries.

The second vulnerability is related to the `LetsSuicide` contract. It calls `suicide(LetsFuckingSuicide);`, which will forcibly send the entire contract balance to the provided address, potentially draining funds from the `lottopollo` contract. This makes the system prone to destructive attacks, where an attacker could terminate the contract and send its balance to any arbitrary address.

Both of these issues create significant security risks.",1149,139,12.264278411865234
129,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the reliance on `block.timestamp` for determining when the investment reset occurs. As mentioned, `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners to some extent, allowing them to adjust the timing slightly to their advantage. This can lead to time manipulation exploits, where a miner or an attacker can manipulate the time window for resetting the investment and collecting the jackpot. This issue occurs in the `resetInvestment` function when the contract checks if `block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp + ONE_MINUTE`.",1317,107,7.557934761047363
130,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the same time manipulation issue in the `Roulette` contract, where the `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) is used in line 18 (`require(now != pastBlockTime);`) and line 20 (`pastBlockTime = now;`). As miners can manipulate the `block.timestamp`, they could exploit this to execute the function at a specific time when the `if(now % 15 == 0)` condition is met, allowing them to drain the contract's balance.

Additionally, the `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract` introduce another vulnerability by using the `suicide` function. This can send all the contract's balance to an address (in this case, `Russian`), which further compromises the contractâ€™s security by allowing funds to be redirected forcefully.",1016,172,12.163449764251709
131,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the usage of `block.timestamp` in the `EtherLotto` contract to generate randomness:

```solidity
var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;
```

As explained, miners can manipulate the block timestamp within a certain range. This allows them to influence the outcome of the random number generation. Since the random number directly determines whether the player wins the pot, a malicious miner can take advantage of this and manipulate the timestamp to increase their chances of winning.

Furthermore, the `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract` contracts introduce another vulnerability: the `suicide` function, which forcefully sends Ether to any address, could be used to disrupt contract behavior. However, the main vulnerability is the timestamp manipulation in `EtherLotto`.",1126,162,10.470165014266968
132,short addresses,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to the presence of the `suicide` (now `selfdestruct`) function in the `LetsSuicide` contract. The `suicide` function allows the contract to send all its ether to the specified address (`LetsFuckingSuicide`), which could potentially lead to loss of funds or unintended transfer of funds to an arbitrary address. This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to forcefully send ether to any address without the recipient's consent.",1174,99,8.238909721374512
133,denial of service,"YES

The contract is vulnerable due to the combination of the `emptyCreditors` function in the `DosGas` contract and the behavior of the `LetsSuicide` contract. The vulnerability arises because the `LetsSuicide` contract uses the `suicide` (now known as `selfdestruct`) function, which forcibly transfers Ether to the specified address (`LetsFuckingSuicide`). If this happens while the `DosGas` contract is running or processing a transaction, it could disrupt normal operations by consuming gas unexpectedly or preventing certain functions from executing, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) scenario.",1142,126,5.281261682510376
134,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability is due to the potential for **denial of service** (DoS) attacks. Specifically:

1. **Array resizing in `insertNnumbers`**: In the `insertNnumbers` function, the dynamic resizing of the `array` on line 20 (`array.length += 1;`) can be exploited to consume excessive gas. If a very large number of elements are inserted, the cost of repeatedly resizing the array can increase significantly, potentially causing the contract to run out of gas, leading to a DoS situation where further transactions cannot be processed.

2. **DoS with `suicide` in `LetsSuicide` contract**: The `suicide` (now `selfdestruct` in newer Solidity versions) in the `LetsSuicide` contract can be used to maliciously send funds to the target contract, disrupting its normal operation by forcing it to handle Ether it may not expect, or potentially blocking future transactions if it does not have the proper fallback functions to handle the Ether. This can lead to another form of denial of service attack.

Both of these issues can render the contract unusable under certain circumstances.",1242,235,13.7207510471344
135,denial of service,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. Specifically, the vulnerability is in the `lendGovernmentMoney` function when it tries to send Ether to creditor addresses. If any of the creditor addresses is a contract that can either revert or consume a significant amount of gas, it could prevent further execution, thereby blocking the payout process. This would deny service to other creditors. 

Additionally, the vulnerability lies in the design where creditor addresses and amounts are reset to empty arrays, which could disrupt the tracking of legitimate creditors and lead to loss of data.",2216,117,9.14335298538208
136,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable because the `refundAll` function uses `send` to transfer funds, and a failure in any single transfer due to conditions like low gas or malicious behavior from one of the recipients will cause the entire loop to revert, thus blocking all refunds. Additionally, the introduction of the `LetsSuicide` contract allows for a denial of service attack by transferring Ether to the `Refunder` contract in a way that could further disrupt the contractâ€™s functionality.",1125,95,7.56432318687439
137,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the potential for a denial-of-service (DoS) attack caused by the excessive use of gas in the `ifillArray` function. Specifically, the loop on line 17 (`for(uint i=0;i<350;i++)`) pushes the `msg.sender` to the `listAddresses` array 350 times. As the array grows, the gas cost to execute this operation increases, potentially causing the transaction to fail once the gas limit is exceeded.

Additionally, the `LetsSuicide` and `SuicideContract` contracts introduce a security risk through the use of the `suicide` function (now called `selfdestruct` in modern Solidity versions). This can result in the forced transfer of ether to a vulnerable contract, potentially rendering it unusable due to malicious behavior. This further contributes to the DoS vulnerability.",1019,173,12.89120626449585
138,denial of service,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability occurs due to the use of `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` in the `DosAuction` contract. This sends funds to the `currentFrontrunner` using the `send` method, which forwards only a limited amount of gas. If the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract, such as the `LetsSuicide` or another contract with fallback functions that consume excessive gas or revert the transaction, it can block the auction by preventing the send operation from succeeding. This will cause the `require` statement to fail, denying further bids and locking the auction in a denial of service state.",1012,137,8.383578777313232
