The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function of the `MultiOwnable` contract. This function allows any external user to add themselves or any other address as an owner by passing the required `_owner` parameter, without proper access control. This opens up the contract to unauthorized ownership changes, leading to potential malicious access.",1355,67,5.772295951843262
12,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in the given smart contract stems from the `missing()` function. This function is public and allows **anyone** to set themselves as the owner by calling it. Once a malicious user calls the `missing()` function, they can take control of the contract and execute functions protected by the `onlyowner` modifier, such as the `withdraw()` function. This allows the attacker to drain all the funds from the contract. 

The access control issue here is that there is no proper restriction or initialization of the `owner` variable, making the contract vulnerable to unauthorized ownership changes.",1093,123,10.801146745681763
13,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the function `DynamicPyramid()`, which assigns the `creator` to `msg.sender`.

The vulnerability lies in the **withdraw function** of the `Wallet` contract. Specifically, the condition in line 19: 

```solidity
require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);
```

This line should use a less-than comparison (`<=`) to ensure that the user can only withdraw an amount less than or equal to their balance, but it currently allows users to withdraw amounts greater than their actual balance.

Additionally, the **migrateTo function** only restricts access to the creator of the contract, which can pose risks if the creator's account is compromised.",1210,122,10.173553943634033
15,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the function `IamMissing()` in the `Missing` contract, which allows anyone to call it and set themselves as the owner. Since this function is public and lacks any restriction, it effectively allows any caller to take ownership of the contract and withdraw all the funds, which is an access control vulnerability.",1103,66,5.3155927658081055
16,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `Map` contract. While the issue is with access control, it specifically relates to the fact that the `set()` function allows any user to modify the `map` array. There is no restriction in place to limit who can call the `set()` function. This allows anyone to alter the state of the `map` array, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or malicious manipulation of the contract's data.

Furthermore, although the `withdraw()` function is protected by a `require` statement ensuring only the owner can withdraw, the lack of access control on the `set()` function is a serious issue that violates the principle of access control.",1168,136,6.706625699996948
17,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the reckless use of `delegatecall` in the `Proxy` contract. The `delegatecall` allows the `callee` to execute code in the context of the calling contract, which can lead to security risks if the `callee` is untrusted. This opens the contract to potential access control issues where malicious contracts could exploit the proxy's execution context and potentially access or manipulate the owner's address or other sensitive data.",1071,95,10.603510856628418

While the contract restricts access to destroying the contract (`Destroy()`), there is no such access control on critical functions like `PushBonusCode()`, `PopBonusCode()`, and `UpdateBonusCodeAt()`. These functions can be called by any user, allowing them to manipulate the `bonusCodes` array without restrictions. This violates proper access control measures, which is a key security concern. 

Additionally, in `PopBonusCode()`, the `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length)` is always true due to the nature of unsigned integers, making the check redundant. However, the core issue here is the lack of access control.",1264,151,16.10352063179016

The vulnerability lies in the function `Constructor` in the `Missing` contract. In Solidity versions before 0.5.0, constructors are defined using the contract name. However, in this code, the function is named `Constructor`, not `Missing`. This makes it a regular public function rather than a constructor.

20,access control,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to the `initWallet` function in the `Wallet` contract, which can be called multiple times by any user, allowing them to set themselves as the creator and take control of the contract.

This vulnerability is classified as an **access control** issue.",1060,74,8.433177947998047
22,access control,"YES. The contract is vulnerable.

In the `Wallet` contract, the `refund` function allows any user to call it and withdraw their entire balance without any restrictions. However, there is no access control or authorization check on this function, which means anyone can call it for their own benefit.

Moreover, in the `migrateTo` function, although it restricts access to the contract creator, it transfers the entire contract balance to the specified address. If the creator's private key is compromised, this function could be abused to drain all funds from the contract.

96,bad randomness,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The randomness generation logic in the `RandomNumberGenerator` contract uses predictable sources, such as `block.timestamp`, `block.number`, and `blockhash`. These values can be influenced or predicted by miners, making the generated ""random"" number vulnerable to manipulation. Specifically:

- **Line 12**: `uint256 private salt = block.timestamp;` uses `block.timestamp`, which miners can influence slightly.

The vulnerability is due to the reliance on `block.timestamp` (or `now`), which can be manipulated by miners. Specifically:

137,denial of service,"YES. It is vulnerable due to the same Denial of Service vulnerability found in the original `DosOneFunc` contract. Specifically, the for-loop in the `ifillArray` function on line 17:

```solidity
for(uint i=0;i<350;i++) {
    listAddresses.push(msg.sender);
}
```

This loop can cause the function to consume a significant amount of gas, potentially leading to a situation where the gas limit is exceeded, preventing the function from executing successfully. This results in a denial of service, as users may be unable to interact with the contract once the gas required to complete the function exceeds the block's gas limit.",1145,134,11.028453826904297
138,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` line in the `DosAuction` contract. If the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that refuses to accept Ether (or uses more gas than allowed), the `send` function will fail, preventing new bids and causing a denial of service attack. This vulnerability is often referred to as a ""Denial of Service with Failed Send.""",1138,95,6.998047828674316
