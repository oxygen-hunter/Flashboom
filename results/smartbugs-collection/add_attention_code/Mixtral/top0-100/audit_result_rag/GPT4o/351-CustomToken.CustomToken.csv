The vulnerability in the contract arises in the `newOwner` function within the `MultiOwnable` contract. This function allows any external address to add a new owner by setting the `owners` mapping. Since the function does not enforce any ownership or permission checks, it allows any user to potentially add themselves as an owner, thus bypassing access control.

",1352,73,5.5556793212890625
12,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `missing` function, which allows anyone to call it and set themselves as the owner. This results in an access control vulnerability, as unauthorized users can gain control of the contract and its funds.",1090,46,4.626904726028442
13,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the constructor function `DynamicPyramid()` at line 23. The function does not use the `constructor` keyword, meaning it is treated as a regular function instead of a constructor. This allows anyone to call the `DynamicPyramid()` function after deployment and change the `creator` address, leading to an access control vulnerability where any external party can gain control of the contract.",3010,82,7.431126594543457
14,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function of the `Wallet` contract. Specifically, the line:

```solidity

This condition is incorrect and should be `require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);`. The current condition allows users to withdraw funds even when their balance is lower than the withdrawal amount, leading to potential unauthorized fund withdrawals.

Additionally, in the `migrateTo` function, the contract uses `to.transfer(this.balance);`, which can be vulnerable if there is no proper access control mechanism beyond the creator check.",1207,116,9.031084775924683

The vulnerability lies in the following function of the `Missing` contract:

```solidity

This function, `IamMissing`, is a public function that allows anyone to set themselves as the owner of the contract. Because of its public visibility, any user can call this function and take over the contract, effectively gaining control over the withdrawal functionality. This results in a critical access control issue, allowing unauthorized access to privileged functions such as `withdraw()`.",1100,107,6.23448920249939

Using `delegatecall` without proper access control allows an external contract (callee) to execute code in the context of the calling contract (Proxy), which could modify its state or access its data. Since there is no restriction on who can call the `forward` function, an attacker could exploit this to execute malicious code, thereby gaining control over the `Proxy` contract's state or assets.",1068,106,8.528982162475586

The vulnerability in the `Wallet` contract lies in the lack of access control for the `PushBonusCode`, `PopBonusCode`, and `UpdateBonusCodeAt` functions. Any external account can call these functions, potentially modifying the internal state (`bonusCodes`) without restriction. Specifically:

1. **PushBonusCode**: Any user can add new bonus codes.
2. **PopBonusCode**: Any user can remove a bonus code, decreasing the array size.
3. **UpdateBonusCodeAt**: Any user can update any bonus code at a given index.

21,access control,"YES

The vulnerability is due to the usage of `tx.origin == owner` in the `sendTo` function. Using `tx.origin` to validate the owner allows attackers to exploit the contract via phishing attacks.

The smart contract is vulnerable due to the reckless use of `delegatecall` in the `FibonacciBalance` contract, specifically in the following lines:

1. **Line 31**: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(fibSig, withdrawalCounter));`
2. **Line 38**: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(msg.data));`

These lines allow the contract to delegate execution to an external contract, which can modify the state of the calling contract, including sensitive variables like `calculatedFibNumber` and `fibonacciLibrary`. This can result in access control vulnerabilities, as an attacker could manipulate these delegate calls to execute arbitrary code or gain unauthorized access to funds. 

Moreover, since the `FibonacciLib` contract has public functions that can be manipulated, the combination of the `delegatecall` with potentially unsafe input could lead to serious security risks.",1491,178,9.581221103668213

136,denial of service,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability exists in the `refundAll()` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));
```

This line can lead to a **Denial of Service (DoS)** vulnerability. If any address in `refundAddresses` rejects the payment (for example, if the fallback function runs out of gas or reverts), the entire loop will stop, and no further refunds will be processed. As a result, all subsequent addresses will be unable to receive their refunds. This is a classic case of DoS in smart contracts.",1248,129,8.517507076263428

138,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the line:

```solidity
require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));
```

This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack because if the `send()` function fails, the `bid()` function will revert, preventing new bids from being placed. This happens if the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that refuses to accept payments (e.g., due to fallback functions with high gas requirements or intentionally causing the transfer to fail).",1135,106,9.170706987380981
