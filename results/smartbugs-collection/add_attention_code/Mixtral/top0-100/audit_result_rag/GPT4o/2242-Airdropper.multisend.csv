The vulnerability in the given smart contract is due to the use of `send()` in the `SendBack` contract. Specifically:

- In the `SendBack` contract, the function `withdrawBalance()` includes the line `msg.sender.send(amountToWithdraw);`, which is a low-level call. The `send()` function does not throw an exception when it fails. Instead, it returns `false` if the transfer fails. In this case, the return value is unchecked, which can lead to funds not being successfully transferred, and the user balance being set to zero regardless, resulting in a loss for the user.
  
Additionally:

- The `Airdropper` contract contains a loop (`while (i < dests.length)`) which iterates over the destination addresses.

This line uses a low-level `call` function, which does not automatically handle failures. If the external contract being called fails, the call will return `false`, but this return value is not checked. This can lead to unwanted consequences, such as failure of the `transferFrom` function not being detected, and the contract continuing execution without reverting or stopping, potentially allowing malicious actors to exploit the contract.",1121,129,11.508599519729614
71,unchecked low level calls,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `sendMoney` function within the `SimpleWallet` contract. It uses a low-level `call` function (`_target.call.value(_value)();`) to send Ether, and as explained, low-level calls do not propagate errors. Since the return value of this call is not checked, it can fail silently, potentially leading to the loss of funds or other unwanted behavior.

Additionally, in the `Airdropper` contract, the `multisend` function uses a while loop to distribute tokens. Although not directly related to the vulnerability type you mentioned, this could lead to gas exhaustion if the `dests` array is too large.",1169,138,9.719666242599487

131,time manipulation,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is due to the use of `block.timestamp` for randomness in the line:

```solidity
var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;
```

This introduces the possibility of miner manipulation, as miners can influence `block.timestamp` to control the outcome of the random number generation. This reliance on time for randomness can be exploited, leading to unfair outcomes in the contract.",1208,88,8.198557138442993
132,short addresses,"YES, it is vulnerable. The `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract is susceptible to short address attacks. This is because it relies on external calls to the `transfer` function of an ERC20 token without verifying the length of input data. If a client creates a transaction with a malformed address, the EVM might interpret the arguments incorrectly, potentially causing funds to be sent to the wrong address or allowing attackers to extract more tokens than intended.",1263,96,9.393028259277344
133,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. It involves a potential **denial of service (DoS)** attack caused by an unbounded loop that iterates over the `dests` array. If the array of destinations is too large, the gas cost of executing the function could exceed the block gas limit, preventing the function from completing and potentially locking the contract in a state where it can't execute further operations.",1224,97,6.774149656295776
134,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability stems from the `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract, specifically in the `while` loop. This loop iterates over the entire `dests` array and calls the `transfer` function for each address. If the `dests` array is large, the gas required to execute the function increases significantly. This could lead to a situation where the gas limit is exceeded, resulting in the function being unable to complete its execution. This type of issue is known as a ""Denial of Service (DoS)"" vulnerability due to excessive gas consumption, effectively preventing the function from working as intended for large inputs.",1324,141,11.821680307388306
135,denial of service,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to the potential for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. Specifically, the `while` loop iterates over the `dests` array, sending tokens to each address. If one of the recipients is a contract that rejects tokens or runs out of gas, the entire transaction will fail, preventing any further recipients from receiving their tokens. This can result in a DoS, as a single faulty recipient can block the entire batch of transfers.",2298,116,8.296632528305054
136,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll()` function of the `Refunder` contract. The use of `require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));` can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack. If one of the addresses in `refundAddresses` fails the `send()` function, the entire loop will revert, preventing the refund process for all addresses. A malicious or unintended failure from one address can thus block refunds for everyone, making the contract vulnerable to DoS.",1207,113,14.061519622802734
137,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract. It uses a `while` loop to iterate over the `dests` array, which could potentially cause the contract to run out of gas if the array is too large, leading to a **Denial of Service** (DoS) vulnerability due to gas exhaustion. This can prevent the function from completing and halt the contract.",1101,89,9.899221658706665
138,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because the `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` line introduces a Denial of Service (DoS) risk. If the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that has a fallback function that consumes a lot of gas or reverts the transaction, the `send` function will fail, preventing other bidders from placing bids and effectively halting the auction.",1094,84,7.50371789932251
