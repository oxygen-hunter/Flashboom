The contract is vulnerable to an arithmetic overflow on line 25, where the `balance` is updated with `balance += deposit;`.

The vulnerability still exists in the `run` function. Specifically, the line `count -= input;` can lead to an arithmetic underflow if `input` is greater than `count`.

The vulnerability is still present due to potential integer overflows or underflows in arithmetic operations involving `numTokens`, particularly in the following lines:
