The vulnerability lies in the `forward` function, which calls the `delegatecall` function on the `callee` address. This allows the `callee` address to call back into the `Proxy` contract, potentially causing a reentrancy attack.

Reentrancy attacks occur when a contract calls another contract, and the called contract calls back into the original contract, causing a loop. This can cause the original contract to run out of gas and fail.

In this case, the `CustomToken` contract is calling the `delegatecall` function on the `Proxy` contract, which can potentially cause a reentrancy attack.",669,158,5.56770920753479

This function is used to transfer the contract's ownership to the address that called the function.

There is no access control vulnerability in this code, as the `selfdestruct()` function is only called by the contract owner, which is the address that deployed the contract.

The `delegatecall` function is used to call the `FibonacciLib` contract's `setFibonacci` function, which sets the `calculatedFibNumber` variable to the correct value. The `withdraw` function then transfers the funds to the caller.

The reason is that it contains a low-level call to the `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)` function, which does not propagate errors and will return a boolean value set to false if the call fails. This can lead to fail-opens and other unwanted outcomes.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)` function is not properly checked for errors, and the code continues to run even if the call fails. This can allow an attacker to exploit the vulnerability and cause the contract to fail.

To fix the vulnerability, the code should properly check the return value of the `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)` function and handle any errors that may occur.",1944,178,6.254778861999512

There is no evidence of any vulnerabilities in the code. The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The only potential issue I can see is that the contract may not be able to handle a large number of users claiming the throne at the same time, as it may cause the contract to run out of gas.

The vulnerability lies in the use of the `send()` function, which can fail and not return a boolean value as expected. This can lead to a situation where the contract continues to execute even if the transfer of funds fails, resulting in a loss of funds for the buyer.

The vulnerability is in line 109: `winner.send(subpot);`. The `send()` function is used to transfer funds from the winner's account to the buyer's account. If the transfer fails, the contract will continue to execute and the buyer will lose their funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use the `transfer()` function instead of `send()`. The `transfer()` function returns a boolean value indicating whether the transfer was successful or not.

The `send()` function does not propagate errors, and if it fails, it will return a boolean value of `false`, and the code will continue to run. This can lead to fail-opens and other unwanted outcomes.

The vulnerability in the `sendToWinner()` function is that the `winner.send(winAmount)` line can fail, and the `payedOut` variable will not be set to `true`, allowing the winner to withdraw the funds again.

The vulnerability in the `withdrawLeftOver()` function is that the `msg.sender.send(this.balance)` line can fail, and the funds will be lost.

This line of code calls the `transferOwner` function of the target contract, which can be exploited by an attacker to change the owner of the contract. The `call` function does not propagate errors, so if the `transferOwner` function fails, the code will continue to run and the attacker can gain unauthorized access to the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `call` function should be replaced with a function that propagates errors, such as `callcode` or `delegatecall`. This will ensure that any errors that occur during the execution of the `transferOwner` function are properly handled and the code will not continue to run if the function fails.",1099,283,9.857808113098145

82,arithmetic,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the fact that it does not handle arithmetic overflows and underflows correctly.

In the `buy` function, the line `require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);` checks that the amount of ether sent with the transaction is equal to the number of tokens being purchased multiplied by the price per token. However, if the number of tokens being purchased is greater than the maximum value of an unsigned integer (2^256 - 1), this check will fail and the transaction will be reverted. This can allow an attacker to send a large number of tokens to the contract, potentially causing a denial of service or theft.

Similarly, in the `sell` function, the line `require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= numTokens);` checks that the number of tokens being sold is less than or equal to the number of tokens owned by the sender. However, if the number of tokens owned by the sender is greater than the maximum value of an unsigned integer, this check will fail and the transaction will be reverted. This can allow an attacker to sell a large number of tokens to the contract, potentially causing a denial of service or theft.

The ""settle"" function checks if the block number has passed and if the user's guess is correct, it transfers 2 Ether to the user.

There is no apparent vulnerability in the code. The contract does not use any external contracts, and the ""lockInGuess"" function does not allow any external calls.
