The contract also has a withdraw function that allows users to withdraw Ether from the contract. The contract also has a migrateTo function that allows the contract creator to transfer the contract's balance to another address.

The code does not have any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker. The contract is well-structured and has proper access control mechanisms in place. The creator of the contract is only allowed to call the migrateTo function, and the balanceOf mapping is only accessible to the contract owner. The code also uses the assert keyword to ensure that the balance of the contract is not negative, which helps prevent reentrancy attacks.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to any known security issues.",999,209,7.277197599411011
21,access control,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that has a single function called `sendTo` that allows the owner of the contract to transfer a specified amount of tokens to a receiver address. The function uses the `require` statement to check that the caller is the owner of the contract before executing the transfer. This ensures that the transfer can only be executed by the owner of the contract, and prevents any other address from executing the transfer. Therefore, there is no access control vulnerability in the code.",717,112,4.130848407745361
22,access control,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a smart contract that implements a simple wallet functionality.

The deposit function allows anyone to deposit Ether into the contract, the withdraw function allows the owner of the contract to withdraw Ether from the contract, and the refund function allows anyone to refund Ether to the owner of the contract. The contract also has a migrateTo function that allows the owner to transfer the contract to a new address.

There is no evidence of any vulnerability in the code. The code is well-structured and follows the best practices for writing smart contracts. The only potential issue I can see is that the contract does not have any access control mechanisms in place, which could make it vulnerable to unauthorized access. However, this is not a vulnerability in the code itself, but rather a potential issue that could be addressed by adding access control mechanisms to the contract.",1031,234,7.923738479614258

27,unchecked low level calls,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The reason is that it is using the `call` function, which can be used to execute arbitrary code on the blockchain. This can lead to a variety of vulnerabilities, including reentrancy attacks, denial of service, and other types of attacks.

The `call` function allows the caller to execute a function on a different contract, which can be used to manipulate the state of the contract. This can be done by calling the `call` function with a specific address and data, which can be used to execute a function on the target contract. This can be used to manipulate the state of the contract, such as transferring funds or changing the state of the contract.

Additionally, the `call` function does not check the return value of the function being called, which can lead to unexpected behavior. This can be used to execute a function that does not return a value, which can lead to a fail-open vulnerability.

Therefore, it is recommended to use the `call` function with caution and to check the return value of the function being called to ensure that it is executed correctly.",1999,246,8.61337685585022

33,unchecked low level calls,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the `Transfer` event. The event is emitted when a transfer of tokens occurs, but it does not check if the transfer was successful or not. This means that if the transfer fails, the event is still emitted, and the contract continues to execute. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially allow for attacks.

To fix this vulnerability, the `Transfer` event should be modified to check if the transfer was successful before emitting the event. This can be done by adding a check for the return value of the `transfer` function, which returns a boolean value indicating whether the transfer was successful or not. If the transfer was not successful, the event should not be emitted.",693,172,5.813084840774536

The vulnerability lies in the use of the `send()` function in the `sendToWinner()` and `withdrawLeftOver()` functions. The `send()` function can fail and return a boolean value of `false`, which can lead to a fail-open vulnerability. This means that if the `send()` function fails, the contract will not revert the current execution, and the code will continue to run. This can allow an attacker to exploit the vulnerability and manipulate the contract's state.

The vulnerability is due to the fact that the `send()` function does not propagate or bubble up, and it will not lead to a total reversion of the current execution. Instead, it will return a boolean value set to `false`, and the code will continue to run. This can surprise developers and, if the return value of such low-level calls are not checked, can lead to fail-opens and other unwanted outcomes.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` contract does not have any checks to ensure that the `totalSupply` variable is not modified by an attacker.",784,119,4.113496541976929
69,unchecked low level calls,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a smart contract that inherits from the BaseToken contract and adds a new function called CustomToken. The CustomToken function is not vulnerable to the low-level functions call(), callcode(), delegatecall() and send() because it is not using them.",973,67,2.449489116668701
70,unchecked low level calls,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a solidity contract that inherits from the BaseToken contract and adds a new function called transfer. The transfer function takes four parameters: from, caddress, _tos, and v. The function first checks if the length of the _tos array is greater than zero. If it is, it then creates a bytes4 variable called id and sets it to the keccak256 hash of the string ""transferFrom(address,address,uint256)"". It then enters a for loop that iterates over the _tos array and calls the caddress contract's transferFrom function with the from address, the caddress address, and the value at the current index of the _tos array. The function then returns true.

Therefore, the code does not appear to be vulnerable to any known smart contract vulnerabilities.",851,193,6.554979562759399

72,unchecked low level calls,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, which inherits from the `BaseToken` contract. The `CustomToken` contract does not have a constructor function, which means that the `totalSupply`, `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals` variables are not initialized. This means that the `balanceOf` mapping is not properly initialized, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

79,arithmetic,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to integer overflows and underflows. The vulnerability lies in the `add` function, where the `balance` variable is incremented by the `deposit` parameter without any bounds checking. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the `balance` variable overflowing and causing the contract to revert.

To fix this vulnerability, the `add` function should be modified to check for overflows and underflows before incrementing the `balance` variable. This can be done by using the `SafeMath` library, which provides safe mathematical operations for Solidity.",603,136,4.626246452331543

91,bad randomness,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to make a guess about the next block hash. The contract has a constructor that requires a 1 ETH deposit, and a function called ""lockInGuess"" that requires a 1 ETH deposit and a 32-byte hash as input. The contract also has a ""settle"" function that checks if the guess is correct and pays out 2 ETH if it is.

There is no apparent vulnerability in the code. The contract does not use any external contracts, and there is no apparent attempt to manipulate the block hash. The only potential vulnerability could be if the contract is used to make a guess about a future block hash that is known to be a specific value, but this would require a significant amount of computational power to guess the hash.",1049,184,6.259817123413086
92,bad randomness,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of the `block.coinbase` and `block.difficulty` variables in the `chooseWinner()` function. These variables are not secure sources of randomness, as they can be predictable and manipulated by miners. This can lead to a reentrancy attack, where an attacker can repeatedly call the `buyTickets()` function and drain the contract of funds.

Additionally, the `block.number` variable is also used in the `buyTickets()` function, which can also be predictable and manipulated by miners. This can lead to a reentrancy attack as well.

It is important to note that this is a basic guide and may not cover all potential vulnerabilities. Smart contract auditing is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of blockchain technology and the Solidity programming language.",3208,207,7.338013172149658
93,bad randomness,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of the `block.blockhash()` function, which is used to generate random numbers. However, this function is not secure and can be manipulated by miners. This means that the random number generated by the `rand()` function can be predictable, making it vulnerable to attacks.

Attackers can potentially exploit this vulnerability by predicting the random number generated by the `rand()` function and manipulating the contract's behavior. For example, they can try to predict the next random number and then manipulate the contract's state to gain an unfair advantage.

Therefore, it is recommended to use a secure random number generation function, such as the `getRandomNumber()` function provided by the OpenZeppelin library, to generate random numbers in smart contracts.",3476,186,7.071889162063599

132,short addresses,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a short address attack. The reason is that the `address` type in Solidity is a 160-bit value, but the `to` parameter in the `sendCoin` function is of type `address`, which is a 20-byte value. This means that the `to` parameter can be a short address, which is a 20-byte value that is less than 160 bits. When this happens, the EVM will pad the short address with zeros on the left, which can cause the contract to behave unexpectedly.

For example, if the `to` parameter is a short address, the EVM will pad it with zeros on the left, so the actual address that is used in the contract will be a 160-bit value. This can cause the contract to behave differently than expected, leading to vulnerabilities.

Therefore, it is important to use the `address` type in the `sendCoin` function to ensure that the `to` parameter is a valid 160-bit address.",1026,237,8.174498319625854

The code also has two functions called `getLengthArray` and `getRealLengthArray` that return the length of the array and the real length of the array, respectively.

The code does not have any vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an attacker. The `insertNnumbers` function checks if the array has enough space to store the new elements, and if not, it increases the size of the array. The `clear` function checks if the number of elements in the array is greater than 1500, and if so, it sets the number of elements to 0. The `clearDOS` function also checks if the number of elements in the array is greater than 1500, and if so, it sets the number of elements to 0.

The code also has access controls in place, as the `clear` and `clearDOS` functions are only accessible to the owner of the contract. Additionally, the code does not use any external contracts or libraries",1119,301,10.329604625701904

137,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that has a function called `ifillArray` that fills an array with 350 addresses. The function returns true if the array is less than 1500 addresses, and false otherwise. The code does not have any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker.",837,79,2.79297137260437
138,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to bid on a token. It has a modifier that checks if the bid is greater than the current bid, and it also checks if the current frontrunner is not 0 before sending the bid. The code also sets the current frontrunner to the sender of the transaction and sets the current bid to the value of the transaction.

Therefore, the code does not have any known vulnerabilities.",827,110,3.96280837059021
