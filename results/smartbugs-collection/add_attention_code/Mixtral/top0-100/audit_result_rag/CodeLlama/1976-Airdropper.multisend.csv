115,reentrancy,  NO,1319,3,0.40110301971435547
116,reentrancy,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The function `multisend` is marked as `onlyOwner`, which means it can only be called by the owner of the contract. The owner is set to the address of the contract creator, which is the address that deployed the contract. Therefore, the function can only be called by the contract creator, and it cannot be called by an external contract or a low level function with an external address.",1423,101,3.6503050327301025
117,reentrancy,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The reason is that the `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract calls the `transfer` function of the `ERC20` contract, which can potentially make new calls to the `Airdropper` contract before the initial execution is complete. This can allow an attacker to repeatedly call the `multisend` function and drain the contract of funds.",855,102,4.013720512390137
118,reentrancy,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function, which allows an external contract to call the `transfer` function of the `ERC20` contract, which in turn calls the `multisend` function again, creating a recursive loop. This can cause the contract to run out of gas and fail.",795,86,3.043865919113159
119,reentrancy,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The function `multisend` is marked as `onlyOwner`, which means it can only be called by the owner of the contract. The owner is set to the address of the contract creator, which is `msg.sender` in the constructor. Therefore, the function can only be called by the contract creator, and it cannot be called by an external contract.

Therefore, the reentrancy attack cannot occur in this contract.",1437,111,3.9489457607269287

121,reentrancy,"  YES, the contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The reason is that the `multisend` function calls the `transfer` function of the ERC20 contract, which can potentially make a new call to the `multisend` function before the initial execution is complete. This can cause the contract state to change in the middle of its execution, leading to unintended behavior.",1481,86,3.1490402221679688
122,reentrancy,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The function `multisend` is marked as `onlyOwner`, which means it can only be called by the owner of the contract. The owner is set to the address of the contract creator, which is the address that deployed the contract. Therefore, the function `multisend` can only be called by the contract creator, and it cannot be called by any other address.

Therefore, the reentrancy attack is not possible in this contract, and it is not vulnerable to this type of attack.",1307,127,4.484713315963745

This can cause the contract state to change in the middle of its execution, leading to unintended behavior.",1483,86,3.1884210109710693
126,reentrancy,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The contract has a modifier ""onlyOwner"" which checks if the caller is the owner of the contract before executing the function. This modifier ensures that the function can only be executed by the owner of the contract, and prevents any external contract from calling the function. Therefore, the reentrancy attack is not possible in this case.",735,88,3.1081490516662598
127,time manipulation,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of the `block.timestamp` variable, which is a source of randomness. However, the contract does not use a secure random number generator, and the value of `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners. This can lead to a reentrancy attack, where an attacker can repeatedly call the `multisend` function and drain the contract of funds.

The vulnerability is due to the fact that the `block.timestamp` variable is used to generate random numbers, which is a common vulnerability in smart contracts. The `block.timestamp` variable is not a secure random number generator, and it can be manipulated by miners. This means that the random numbers generated by the contract can be predictable, which can lead to a reentrancy attack.

To fix the vulnerability, the contract should use a secure random number generator, such as the `random` function in the `SafeMath` library. The `random` function generates a random number using the `block.timestamp` variable, but it also uses a secure random number generator to generate the random number. This ensures that the random number is truly random and not predictable.",619,269,8.965111017227173
128,time manipulation,"  NO, this code is not vulnerable. The code is using the `Ownable` contract from OpenZeppelin, which provides a modifier `onlyOwner` that checks if the caller is the owner of the contract before executing the function. This modifier is used in the `multisend` function, which is only callable by the owner of the contract. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.",898,94,3.301304578781128
129,time manipulation,  NO,1178,3,0.3842475414276123
130,time manipulation,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of the `now` variable, which is a block timestamp, and is used to determine the winner of the game. The `now` variable is not guaranteed to be accurate, and can be manipulated by miners, which can lead to a reentrancy attack. Additionally, the `pastBlockTime` variable is not updated properly, which can lead to a denial of service attack.",750,102,3.5568840503692627
131,time manipulation,"  NO, this code is not vulnerable. The code is using the `Ownable` and `ERC20` contracts, which are both well-known and widely used in the Ethereum ecosystem. The `Ownable` contract is used to restrict access to certain functions to the contract owner, and the `ERC20` contract is used to transfer tokens. The code is not using any of the vulnerabilities mentioned in the previous answer.",964,100,3.5282862186431885
132,short addresses,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a short address attack. The reason is that the `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract uses the `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function, which does not check the validity of the `to` address before sending the tokens. This means that an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending tokens to a short address, which will cause the contract to revert and lose the tokens.",957,105,3.6820945739746094
133,denial of service,"  NO, this code is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The code is using the `onlyOwner` modifier from the `Ownable` contract, which ensures that only the owner of the contract can call the `multisend` function. Additionally, the `multisend` function is only called by the owner of the contract, so there is no possibility of a denial of service attack.",923,90,3.2072627544403076
134,denial of service,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable. The contract is using the modifier ""onlyOwner"" from the Ownable contract, which ensures that only the owner of the contract can call the ""multisend"" function. The ""multisend"" function is only callable by the owner of the contract, so there is no possibility of a denial of service attack.",1050,81,2.922201633453369
135,denial of service,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable. The code is written in Solidity, which is a statically typed language that compiles to a virtual machine. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an attacker.",2474,54,2.2533860206604004
136,denial of service,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable. The code is well-structured and there are no obvious vulnerabilities. The onlyOwner modifier in the Ownable contract is used correctly, and the multisend function is only callable by the owner. The ERC20 transfer function is also called correctly, and the values array is used correctly to transfer the correct amount of tokens to each destination address.",950,87,3.1148879528045654
137,denial of service,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The contract has a modifier ""onlyOwner"" on the ""multisend"" function, which ensures that only the owner of the contract can call this function. Additionally, the function only allows the transfer of 10**15 tokens at a time, which is a relatively small amount. This means that even if the attacker were to repeatedly call the ""multisend"" function, they would not be able to drain the contract of all its tokens.",768,115,3.9700560569763184
138,denial of service,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The contract has a modifier that checks if the caller is the owner of the contract before allowing the transfer of tokens. Additionally, the transfer function is only called if the value of the transfer is greater than the current bid, which ensures that the contract is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.",758,81,2.8557257652282715
