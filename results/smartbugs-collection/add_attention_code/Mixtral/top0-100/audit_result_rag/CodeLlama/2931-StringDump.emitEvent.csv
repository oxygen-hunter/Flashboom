93,bad randomness,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of the `block.blockhash()` function, which can be manipulated by miners to influence the outcome of the random number generation. This can lead to a reentrancy attack, where an attacker can repeatedly call the `join()` function and drain the contract of funds.

Additionally, the use of the `block.number - 1` in the `rand()` function can also be manipulated by miners, leading to a predictable random number generation. This can also be used to exploit the contract.

It is recommended to use a secure random number generation library, such as `OpenZeppelin's` `SafeMath` library, to generate random numbers in the contract.",3239,172,6.124356269836426

The vulnerability lies in line 38: `bool won = (block.number % 2) == 0;`. This line of code uses the `block.number` variable, which is a publicly accessible variable that can be manipulated by miners. This means that the `won` variable is not truly random, and an attacker can potentially predict the outcome of the lottery by manipulating the block number.

Additionally, the vulnerability in line 42: `bets.push(Bet(msg.value, block.number, won));` is also a potential issue, as the `block.number` variable is used to determine the outcome of the lottery. This means that an attacker can potentially manipulate the outcome of the lottery by manipulating the block number.

Overall, the smart contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, as the `block.number` variable is used to determine the outcome of the lottery, which can be manipulated by miners.",979,231,7.744690656661987
95,bad randomness,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable.

The code is using the `keccak256` function to generate a random number, and the `block.blockhash` function to get the hash of the previous block. The `now` function is used to get the current block timestamp.

The `keccak256` function is a cryptographic hash function that takes a variable number of arguments and returns a 256-bit hash value. The `block.blockhash` function returns the hash of the previous block, and the `now` function returns the current block timestamp.

The `keccak256` function is used to generate a random number by combining the hash of the previous block and the current block timestamp. This random number is then used to set the value of the `answer` variable.

The `answer` variable is then used to compare with the user's guess. If the guess is correct, the user is rewarded with 2 ether.

The smart contract is not vulnerable to any known attacks, as it uses a secure random number generation method. The `keccak256` function is a cryptographically secure hash function, and the `block.blockhash` function returns a random hash value. The `now` function returns the current block timestamp, which is also a random value.
