130,time manipulation,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the contract modifies the state of the contract (i.e., the pastBlockTime variable) in the constructor function, which can be called multiple times by different users. This can lead to a situation where a user can call the constructor function multiple times, causing the contract to enter an infinite loop and eventually running out of gas.

Additionally, the contract also modifies the state of the contract in the fallback function, which can also lead to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use the ""pure"" modifier on the constructor function to prevent it from modifying the state of the contract. Additionally, the contract should use the ""view"" modifier on the fallback function to prevent it from modifying the state of the contract.",722,192,6.457248687744141
131,time manipulation,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable. The code is using the `sha3` function to generate a random number, which is a secure way to generate random numbers in Solidity. The `sha3` function is a cryptographic hash function that takes a variable number of arguments and returns a 32-byte hash value. The generated hash value is then used to generate a random number.

The `sha3` function is secure because it is a one-way function, meaning that it is computationally infeasible to determine the input that generated a particular output. This makes it impossible for an attacker to predict the random number that will be generated, making it secure.

Furthermore, the `sha3` function is also used in the `store` function to store the data, which is also secure. The `store` function is used to store the data in the blockchain, and the data is stored in a secure way using the `sha3` function.

133,denial of service,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack.

The code does not contain any vulnerabilities that could be exploited to cause a denial of service. The `emptyCreditors` function is only called when the `creditorAddresses` array has more than 1500 elements, which means that the attacker would need to send a large number of transactions to the contract in order to trigger the vulnerability. Additionally, the `addCreditors` function only allows the addition of 350 new addresses to the `creditorAddresses` array, which means that the attacker would need to send a large number of transactions to the contract in order to cause a denial of service.

Furthermore, the `store` function is only called when the `ZhenData` event is emitted, which means that the attacker would need to send a large number of transactions to the contract in order to trigger the vulnerability.
