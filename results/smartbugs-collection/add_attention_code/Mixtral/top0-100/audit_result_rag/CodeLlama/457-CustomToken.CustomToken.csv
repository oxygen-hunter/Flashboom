The vulnerability is due to the fact that the `send()` function does not propagate or bubble up, and it will not lead to a total reversion of the current execution. Instead, it will return a boolean value set to `false`, and the code will continue to run. This can surprise developers and, if the return value of such low-level calls are not checked, can lead to fail-opens and other unwanted outcomes.

55,unchecked low level calls,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The reason is that it uses the `call` function, which can be used to execute arbitrary code on the blockchain. This can lead to a variety of vulnerabilities, including reentrancy attacks, denial of service attacks, and other types of attacks.

The `call` function allows the caller to execute a function on a different contract, which can be used to manipulate the state of the contract. This can be done by calling the `call` function with a function that modifies the state of the contract, and then calling the `call` function again with a function that reverts the changes made in the first call. This can cause the contract to enter an infinite loop, which can lead to a denial of service attack.

Additionally, the `call` function can be used to execute a function on a different contract that has a different gas limit than the current contract. This can cause the contract to run out of gas and fail, which can lead to a variety of vulnerabilities.

72,unchecked low level calls,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, which inherits from the `BaseToken` contract. The `CustomToken` contract does not have a constructor function, which means that the `totalSupply`, `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals` variables are not initialized. This means that the `balanceOf` mapping is not properly initialized, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

86,arithmetic,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a solidity smart contract that has been audited and tested by the community. It is a well-written and secure contract that has been deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

The code is not vulnerable to integer overflows or underflows because it uses the `uint256` data type for all variables and operations. This data type is a 256-bit unsigned integer that is guaranteed to never overflow or underflow.

Furthermore, the code uses the `SafeMath` library to perform arithmetic operations, which ensures that the calculations are safe and secure. The `SafeMath` library is a widely used library in the Ethereum community that provides a set of functions for performing arithmetic operations in a safe and secure manner.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to integer overflows or underflows, and it is a secure and reliable smart contract.",1035,207,7.240234375
87,arithmetic,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `transfer` function, which has an integer overflow vulnerability. The line `balances[msg.sender] -= _value;` can cause an underflow if the `_value` is greater than the balance of the sender. This can allow an attacker to steal the sender's tokens by repeatedly calling the `transfer` function with a large `_value`.

The `balanceOf` function is also vulnerable to integer overflows, as it can cause an underflow if the balance of an address is greater than the maximum value of a uint256.

The `CustomToken` contract is also vulnerable to integer overflows, as it can cause an underflow if the total supply of tokens is greater than the maximum value of a uint256.

In summary, the given code is vulnerable to integer overflows, which can allow attackers to steal tokens or cause other issues.",877,210,7.367647647857666

91,bad randomness,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to make a guess about the next block hash and win 2 Ether if their guess is correct. The contract uses the `blockhash` function to retrieve the hash of the next block, and the `block.number` function to retrieve the current block number. The `require` statements ensure that the guess is made only after the current block number has been reached, and that the user has sent 1 Ether as a payment. The contract also uses the `transfer` function to transfer 2 Ether to the user if their guess is correct.

Therefore, the code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to randomness, reentrancy, or other security issues.",1046,164,5.801689386367798
92,bad randomness,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of the `block.coinbase` and `block.difficulty` variables in the `chooseWinner()` function. These variables are not secure sources of randomness, as they can be predictable and manipulated by miners. This can lead to a reentrancy attack, where an attacker can repeatedly call the `buyTickets()` function and drain the contract of funds.

Additionally, the `block.number` variable is also used in the `buyTickets()` function, which can also be predictable and manipulated by miners. This can lead to a reentrancy attack as well.

It is important to note that this is a basic guide and may not cover all potential vulnerabilities. Smart contract auditing is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of blockchain technology and the Solidity programming language.",3205,207,7.354593515396118

The vulnerability lies in the use of the `block.blockhash()` function, which is used to generate random numbers. However, this function is not truly random and can be influenced by miners. This means that malicious users can potentially replicate the random number generation and exploit the contract.

Moreover, the contract uses the `block.number` function to generate random numbers, which is also not truly random. This can also be influenced by miners, and can lead to vulnerabilities.

Overall, the use of `block.blockhash()` and `block.number` functions in the contract can lead to vulnerabilities, and the contract should be audited to ensure that it is secure and reliable.",3473,165,6.223822593688965

132,short addresses,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a short address attack. The reason is that the `address` type in Solidity is a 160-bit value, but the `to` parameter in the `sendCoin` function is of type `address`, which is a 20-byte value. This means that the `to` parameter can be a short address, which is a 20-byte value that is less than 160 bits. When this happens, the EVM will pad the short address with zeros on the left, which can cause the contract to behave unexpectedly.

For example, if the `to` parameter is a short address, the EVM will pad it with zeros on the left, so the actual address that is used in the contract will be a 160-bit value. This can cause the contract to behave differently than expected, leading to vulnerabilities.

Therefore, it is important to use the `address` type in the `sendCoin` function to ensure that the `to` parameter is a valid 160-bit address.",1023,237,8.03104567527771

The code also has a custom token that inherits from the BaseToken contract and overrides the constructor function to set the token's name, symbol, decimals, and total supply.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to any known attacks.",989,173,5.9124181270599365
134,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a smart contract that implements a simple array-based data structure. It has a function called `insertNnumbers` that inserts a given number of elements into an array, and a function called `clear` that clears the array. The code also has a function called `clearDOS` that clears the array and sets the number of elements to 0. The code also has two functions called `getLengthArray` and `getRealLengthArray` that return the length of the array and the real length of the array, respectively.

The code does not have any vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an attacker. The `insertNnumbers` function checks if the number of elements in the array is equal to the length of the array before inserting a new element, and it also checks if the number of elements in the array is greater than 1500 before clearing the array. The `clearDOS` function also checks if the number of elements in the array is greater than 1500 before clearing the array.

The code also has access controls in place, as the `clear` function requires the number of elements in the array to be greater than 1500, and the `clearDOS` function requires the number of elements in the array to be greater than 1500 before clearing the array.

138,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a smart contract that implements a simple auction system, where a user can bid on a token by sending Ether to the contract. The contract has a `bid` function that checks if the current bid is greater than the previous bid, and if so, it sends the previous bid to the current frontrunner and updates the current frontrunner and current bid. The contract also has a `BaseToken` contract that inherits from the `BaseToken` contract and has a `CustomToken` contract that inherits from the `BaseToken` contract. The `CustomToken` contract has a `totalSupply` variable that is set to 84000000000000000000000000, a `name` variable that is set to ""LiCoinGold"", a `symbol` variable that is set to ""LCGD"", and a `decimals` variable that is set to 18. The `balanceOf` mapping is also set to the address of the `CustomToken` contract. The `Transfer` event is also emitted.

Therefore, the given code is not vulnerable to any known smart contract vulnerabilities.",824,276,9.402470111846924
