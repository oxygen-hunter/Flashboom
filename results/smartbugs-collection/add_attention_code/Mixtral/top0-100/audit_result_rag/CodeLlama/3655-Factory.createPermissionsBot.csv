The vulnerability lies in the use of the `block.blockhash()` function, which can be manipulated by miners to influence the outcome of the random number generation. This can lead to a reentrancy attack, where an attacker can repeatedly call the `join()` function and drain the contract of funds.

Additionally, the use of the `block.number - 1` in the `rand()` function can also be manipulated by miners, leading to a predictable random number generation. This can also be used to exploit the contract.
