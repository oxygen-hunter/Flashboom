72,unchecked low level calls,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, which inherits from the `BaseToken` contract. The `CustomToken` contract does not have a constructor function, which means that the `totalSupply`, `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals` variables are not initialized. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially result in a vulnerability.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` contract does not have any access control mechanisms in place, which means that anyone can call the `transfer` function and potentially transfer tokens from any address to any other address.

79,arithmetic,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to integer overflows and underflows. The vulnerability lies in the `add` function, where the `balance` variable is incremented by the `deposit` parameter without any bounds checking. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the `balance` variable overflowing and causing the contract to revert.

To fix this vulnerability, the `add` function should be modified to check for overflows and underflows before incrementing the `balance` variable. This can be done by using the `SafeMath` library, which provides functions for safe mathematical operations.",602,134,4.572067975997925

There is no apparent vulnerability in the code.",1048,91,3.404914379119873
92,bad randomness,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of the `block.coinbase` and `block.difficulty` variables in the `chooseWinner()` function. These variables are not secure sources of randomness, as they can be predictable and manipulated by miners. This can lead to a reentrancy attack, where an attacker can repeatedly call the `buyTickets()` function and drain the contract of funds.

Additionally, the `block.number` variable is also used in the `buyTickets()` function, which can also be predictable and manipulated by miners. This can lead to a reentrancy attack as well.

It is important to note that this is a basic guide and may not cover all potential vulnerabilities. Smart contract auditing is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of blockchain technology and the Solidity programming language.",3207,207,7.326526880264282
93,bad randomness,"  YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of the `block.blockhash()` function, which is used to generate random numbers. However, this function is not secure and can be manipulated by miners. This means that the random number generated by the `rand()` function can be predictable, making it vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

Reentrancy attacks occur when a contract calls an external contract before it resolves any effects. This can allow an attacker to repeatedly call the contract and drain the contract of funds. In this case, the `rand()` function is called before the contract resolves any effects, making it vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

Therefore, the smart contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks and should be fixed to ensure the security of the contract.",3475,185,6.895391464233398

118,reentrancy,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The code is a simple smart contract that has three functions: getBalance, addToBalance, and withdrawBalance. The addToBalance function is payable, which means it can receive Ether as input. The withdrawBalance function is not payable, but it calls the msg.sender.call.value(userBalance[msg.sender])() function, which is a low-level function that allows the contract to make a call to another contract.

128,time manipulation,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a smart contract that implements a simple lottery game. It has a `payOut` function that pays out the winner and a `draw` function that calls the `payOut` function. The `randomGen` function generates a random number and the `payOut` function checks if the random number is greater than 0 and if the current time minus the random number is greater than 24 hours. If both conditions are true, the function sends the funds to the winner. The code also has a `BaseToken` contract that inherits from the `CustomToken` contract. The `CustomToken` contract has a `totalSupply`, `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals` variables, and a `balanceOf` mapping that stores the balance of the contract. The `Transfer` event is emitted when a transfer occurs.

Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to any known smart contract vulnerabilities.",966,210,7.119442462921143

The code also has a bank address that is set to the contract creator.

The code does not have any vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an attacker. The only potential vulnerability is if the contract creator tries to manipulate the block.timestamp value, but this is not a vulnerability in the code.",1032,134,4.625143766403198
132,short addresses,"  YES, the given code is vulnerable to a short address attack. The reason is that the `address` type in Solidity is a 160-bit value, but the `to` parameter in the `sendCoin` function is of type `address`, which is a 20-byte value. This means that the `to` parameter can be a short address, which is a 20-byte value that is less than 160 bits. When this happens, the EVM will pad the short address with zeros on the left, which can cause the contract to behave unexpectedly.

For example, if the `to` parameter is a short address, the EVM will pad it with zeros on the left, so the actual address that is used in the contract will be a 160-bit value. This can cause the contract to behave differently than expected, leading to vulnerabilities.

Therefore, it is important to use the `address` type in the `sendCoin` function to ensure that the `to` parameter is a valid 160-bit address.",1025,237,8.183531045913696
133,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a smart contract that inherits from the BaseToken contract and adds a new function called ""CustomToken"" that initializes the total supply, name, symbol, and decimals of the token. It also initializes the balance of the owner's address to the total supply. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to denial of service.",991,87,3.1039626598358154
134,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a smart contract that implements a simple array-based data structure. It has a function called `insertNnumbers` that inserts a given number of elements into an array, and a function called `clear` that clears the array. The code also has a function called `clearDOS` that clears the array and sets the number of elements to 0. The code also has two functions called `getLengthArray` and `getRealLengthArray` that return the length of the array and the real length of the array, respectively.

The code does not have any vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an attacker. The `insertNnumbers` function checks if the array has enough space to store the new elements, and if not, it increases the size of the array. The `clear` function checks if the number of elements in the array is greater than 1500, and if so, it sets the number of elements to 0. The `clearDOS` function also checks if the number of elements in the array is greater than 1500, and if so, it sets the number of elements to 0.

The code also has access controls in place, as the `clear` and `clearDOS` functions are only accessible to the owner of the contract. Additionally, the code does not use any external contracts or libraries",1118,301,10.059971332550049

136,denial of service,"  NO, this smart contract is not vulnerable. The code is well-structured and there are no obvious vulnerabilities.",1018,27,1.135354995727539
137,denial of service,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable. The code is a simple smart contract that has a function called `ifillArray` that fills an array with 350 addresses. The function returns true if the array is less than 1500 addresses, and false otherwise. The code does not have any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker.",836,79,2.8060953617095947
138,denial of service,"  NO, this code is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The code is a simple smart contract that allows users to bid on a token. It has a modifier that checks if the bid is greater than the current bid, and if the current frontrunner is not 0, it sends the current bid to the current frontrunner. The code does not have any other vulnerabilities that could be exploited to cause a denial of service.",826,101,3.507460832595825
