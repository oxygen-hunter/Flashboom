The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` to validate callers, which can lead to access control bypasses. However, in this specific code snippet, there is no direct use of `tx.origin`. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `newOwner` function allows any external caller to become an owner of the contract by setting their address as the owner of another address. This can lead to unauthorized control over the contract's functionality.",1042,110,4.741895437240601
12,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being updated with the `totalSupply` amount for the address `0xbcfe91ed0eaa53975b485384ac3b2f6825be2cf4` before the `Transfer` event is emitted. This can lead to an issue where the `Transfer` event is not emitted for the initial supply transfer, which can cause problems with event subscribers or other contracts that rely on these events.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` contract does not have any access control mechanisms in place, which means that any user can call the `CustomToken()` constructor and potentially reinitialize the contract with a new token supply. This can lead to loss of funds or other unintended consequences.

To fix this vulnerability, you should emit the `Transfer` event before updating the `balanceOf` mapping, and consider adding access control mechanisms to the `CustomToken()` constructor to prevent unauthorized reinitialization of the contract.",703,264,10.870167255401611

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `addPayout` function, where the `creator` address is not checked before sending Ether to the `Participant` addresses. This means that any user can call the `addPayout` function and send Ether to the `Participant` addresses, potentially draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `addPayout` function should be modified to include a modifier that checks if the caller is the `creator` address before executing the function. This can be done by adding a `creatorOnly` modifier and applying it to the `addPayout` function, similar to how the `onlyOwner` modifier is used in other functions.

Here's an example of how the `addPayout` function can be modified to include the `creatorOnly` modifier:

```solidity
modifier creatorOnly {
    require(msg.sender == creator, ""Caller is not the creator"");
    _;
}

function addPayout(uint _fee) private creatorOnly {

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function, specifically in line 20:

require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);

This line allows any user to withdraw their balance, but it does not prevent the user from withdrawing more than their balance. The `require` statement checks if the requested amount is greater than or equal to the user's balance, but it does not prevent the user from requesting more than their balance. This can lead to a situation where a user can drain the contract's funds by repeatedly calling the `withdraw` function with an amount greater than their balance.

To fix this vulnerability, the `require` statement should be modified to check if the requested amount is less than or equal to the user's balance:

require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);",905,195,8.14729356765747
15,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, which inherits from the `BaseToken` contract. The issue is with the constructor of the `CustomToken` contract, specifically the line:

```solidity
balanceOf[0xbcfe91ed0eaa53975b485384ac3b2f6825be2cf4] = totalSupply;
```

This line assigns the entire token supply to the address `0xbcfe91ed0eaa539ed0eaa53975b485384ac3b2f6825be2cf4`. This means that the owner of this address will have control over the entire token supply.

The vulnerability is related to access control, as the `onlyowner` modifier in the `Missing` contract is not applied to the `CustomToken` contract. This means that the `CustomToken` contract's functions can be called by any address, including the address that has control over the entire token supply.

To fix this vulnerability, you should apply the `onlyowner` modifier to the `CustomToken` contract's functions or use a different approach to manage the token supply and ensure that only authorized addresses can access the token's functionality",720,301,12.334875583648682

19,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. The `onlyowner` modifier checks if the `msg.sender` is equal to the `owner`, which is fine for basic access control. However, the vulnerability arises when the contract is used in conjunction with other contracts or libraries that use `tx.origin` for their access control checks.

In the provided code, the `CustomToken` contract inherits from the `BaseToken` contract. If the `BaseToken` contract uses `tx.origin` for its access control checks, an attacker could create a contract that calls the `CustomToken` contract's functions, bypassing the `onlyowner` modifier in the `Missing` contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `BaseToken` contract should also use the `msg.sender` for its access control checks instead of `tx.origin`. Additionally, the `Missing` contract should be updated to use a more secure access control mechanism, such as using a role-based access control system or a proxy contract with a whitelist of authorized addresses.",706,250,10.34384536743164

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `migrateTo` function, which allows the `creator` to transfer the contract's balance to any address. Since the `creator` is set in the `initWallet` function and is not protected, any user who calls `initWallet` can set themselves as the `creator`. This allows them to bypass the `require(creator == msg.sender);` check in the `migrateTo` function and transfer the contract's balance to any address they choose.

To fix this vulnerability, the `creator` should be set in the constructor of the contract and not be accessible or modifiable by any other function. Additionally, the `migrateTo` function should be restricted to only the `creator` or a designated admin address.",932,187,7.843050956726074

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `refund` function, which uses `msg.sender.transfer(balances[msg.sender]);` to send the balance back to the caller. This can be exploited by an attacker who is not the intended recipient of the refund.

In Solidity, `msg.sender` is the address that is currently calling the contract. In the context of the `refund` function, `msg.sender` would be the address that initiated the refund transaction. However, this does not necessarily mean that the address is authorized to receive the refund. An attacker could call the `refund` function and receive the funds intended for the original owner.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should verify that the address calling the `refund` function is authorized to receive the refund. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the caller's address is in a list of authorized addresses or by using a modifier to restrict access to the function.",964,236,9.807154655456543

This can lead to an access control issue if the address 0xbcfe91ed0eaa53975b485384ac3b2f6825be2cf4 is not meant to be the sole owner of the token. If this address is publicly known or can be guessed, it can be exploited by an attacker to drain the token's supply.

To fix this vulnerability, the initial token balance should be set to a smaller amount, and the token distribution should be handled through a more secure process, such as airdropping or a public sale.",597,241,9.929230213165283

This function allows anyone to change the owner of the contract by calling it with the new owner's address as the argument. Since the `changeOwner` function is public and does not have any access control checks, it can be exploited by any user to change the ownership of the contract.

This can lead to various issues, such as unauthorized access to sensitive data, manipulation of contract logic, or even theft of funds if the contract holds any. To fix this vulnerability, the `changeOwner` function should be modified to include access control checks, ensuring that only the current owner or a designated authority can change the ownership of the contract.",701,170,7.094510316848755

In this contract, the `send` function is used to transfer funds from the contract to the addresses `owner2` and `owner`. However, the return value of the `send` function is not checked, which means that if the transfer fails, the contract will continue to execute without any indication of the failure. This can lead to fail-open scenarios and other unwanted outcomes.

The vulnerability lies in the `transfer` function of the `demo` contract, which uses the `call` low-level function to transfer tokens from one address to another. The `call` function is used without checking its return value, which can lead to fail-open situations and other unwanted outcomes.

In the provided code, the `transfer` function in the `demo` contract calls the `call` function on the `caddress` with the `id`, `from`, `_tos[i]`, and `v[i]` parameters. However, it does not check the return value of the `call` function, which can indicate whether the call was successful or not.

To fix this vulnerability, the `transfer` function should check the return value of the `call` function and handle the failure cases appropriately. Here's an example of how the `transfer` function can be modified to check the return value of the `call` function:

```solidity
function transfer(address from, address caddress, address[] _tos, uint[] v) public returns (bool) {
    require(_tos.length > 0);

This line is making a low-level call to the `caddress` contract, which could be the `CustomToken` contract in this case. The `call` function is used to interact with the contract's functions, but it does not revert the transaction if the call fails. Instead, it returns a boolean value indicating the success or failure of the call.

In this case, the code does not check the return value of the `call` function, which means that if the call fails, the code will continue to execute without reverting the transaction. This can lead to fail-open vulnerabilities and other unwanted outcomes.

The vulnerability lies in the use of the low-level call() function in the transfer() function of the demo contract. The call() function is used to interact with other contracts and can potentially fail without reverting the entire transaction. In this case, the call() function is used to transfer tokens from the 'from' address to the '_tos' addresses.

If any of the calls fail, the code will continue to execute, which can lead to unintended consequences. For example, if the 'caddress' is a contract that requires a specific function to be called, and the call() function fails to execute that function, the intended behavior of the contract may not be achieved.

To fix this vulnerability, the return value of the call() function should be checked, and appropriate error handling should be implemented. Additionally, it is recommended to use the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations and to use the built-in transfer() function for ERC20 token transfers, which includes error handling and reverts the transaction in case of failure.",771,233,9.657534122467041

However, the contract is using Solidity version 0.4.19, which does not have built-in overflow checks. This means that if the totalSupply is incremented beyond the maximum value of a uint256 (2^256 - 1), it will wrap around to 0. In this case, if the totalSupply is incremented beyond the maximum value, it will cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect balance for the address 0xbcfe91ed0eaa5right53975b485384ac3b2f6825be2cf4.

The vulnerability lies in the `increaseLockTime` function, where the lock time for an address is increased by a certain number of seconds. If the `_secondsToIncrease` value is large enough, it could cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect lock time value. This could potentially allow a user to withdraw funds before the intended lock time has passed.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use SafeMath library functions for arithmetic operations, which include overflow checks. Here's an updated version of the `increaseLockTime` function using SafeMath:

function increaseLockTime(uint _secondsToIncrease) public {
    require(_secondsToIncrease > 0);

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the following lines:

2. Line 25: `balanceOf[msg.sender] += numTokens;`
3. Line 33: `msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`

In Solidity version 0.4.21, the `+=` and `*=` operators do not check for overflows or underflows. This means that if the result of the operation exceeds the maximum value of a uint256 (2^256 - 1), it will wrap around to 0, leading to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflows and underflows. You can import the library and use its functions for addition and multiplication:

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the `CustomToken()` constructor function. The issue is that the `totalSupply` is set to a very large number (8000000000000000000000000000), and then the `balanceOf` mapping is updated with this value for the address `0xbcfe91ed0eaa53975b485384ac3b2f6825be2cf4`.

The problem arises when the `balanceOf` mapping is accessed later in the contract. Since the `balanceOf` mapping is a `mapping` data type, it can only store a 256-bit unsigned integer value. If the `totalSupply` value is too large, it may cause an integer overflow when it is stored in the `balanceOf` mapping.

This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the contract's state, causing issues like incorrect balances or even theft of tokens.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the operations that perform arithmetic on the `count` variable without checking for overflow or underflow conditions. In Solidity, when an overflow or underflow occurs, the result wraps around the maximum or minimum value of the type, which can lead to unexpected and potentially exploitable behavior.

In this contract, the `count` variable is a `uint` (unsigned integer), which means it can only hold non-negative values. When an overflow occurs (i.e., the result of an addition is greater than the maximum value of `uint`), the result wraps around to the minimum value of `uint`. Similarly, when an underflow occurs (i.e., the result of a subtraction is less than zero), the result wraps around to the maximum value of `uint`.

The vulnerable lines in the code are:

- Line 18: `count += input;`
- Line 24: `count *= input;`
- Line 30: `count -= input;`
- Line 36: `uint res = count + input;`

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the `transfer` function, specifically in the lines where the sender's balance is decremented and the receiver's balance is incremented.

In Solidity version 0.4.18, the `uint` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When subtracting `_value` from `balances[msg.sender]`, if the sender's balance is less than `_value`, an underflow will occur, resulting in an incorrect balance value. This can be exploited by an attacker to drain funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflow and underflow. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath in the `transfer` function:

This line allows the `msg.sender` to call the `withdrawBalance` function again before the balance update is completed. This can lead to multiple withdrawals being executed in a single transaction, potentially draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you can follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests updating the state (effects) before calling external contracts (interactions). Here's an updated version of the `withdrawBalance` function:

```solidity
function withdrawBalance() {

    userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;

    if (!(msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)(""""))) {

The vulnerability lies in line 41:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the external contract to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. In this case, the CashOut function is vulnerable to reentrancy because it allows the external contract to withdraw funds before the balance is updated.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests that you should first perform all checks and effects (updates to the state) before interacting with external contracts. Here's an updated version of the CashOut function:

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (in this case, the `msg.sender`) and sending Ether to it before updating the balance of the `acc` struct. This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `Collect` function before the balance update is completed, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the balance update should be done before the external call, and the contract should use the `transfer` or `send` function instead of `call.value` to send Ether to the external contract.",1427,175,7.448181867599487
117,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function (line 14-18). When the `withdrawBalance` function is called, it sends the entire balance of the user to the caller before updating the user's balance to zero. This allows a malicious contract to call the `transfer` function during the execution of the `withdrawBalance` function, potentially draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the user's balance before sending the funds. Here's an updated version of the `withdrawBalance` function:

If the external contract is malicious and has a fallback function that calls back into the `Collect` function of the `PRIVATE_ETH_CELL` contract, it can potentially withdraw more funds than it should be allowed to. This is because the balance update is not executed until after the external call returns, allowing the malicious contract to drain funds from the `PRIVATE_ETH_CELL` contract.",1485,174,7.415555477142334
122,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

This line allows the CashOut function to be called recursively by an external contract before the initial execution is complete. If an attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the CashOut function, they can potentially drain the funds from the Private_Bank contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balances mapping before calling the external contract. Here's an example of how the CashOut function can be modified to prevent the reentrancy attack:

The vulnerability lies in line 29:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. In this case, the Collect function is vulnerable to reentrancy because it allows the external contract to call the Put function before the balance is deducted.

126,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract. The issue is that the contract allows external calls to be made before the state of the contract is updated, which can lead to reentrancy attacks.

In the `withdrawBalance` function, the contract sends the user's balance to the `msg.sender` before updating the user's balance to 0. This means that if the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract that has a fallback function designed to call `withdrawBalance` again, it can potentially withdraw more funds than it should.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the user's balance before sending the funds. Here's an example of a secure implementation:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0

contract Reentrancy_secure {

    mapping (address => uint) private userBalances;

    function withdrawBalance() public {

128,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `randomGen()` function, which returns `block.timestamp`. Since miners have some leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, this can be manipulated to some extent. This can affect the randomness of the `randomGen()` function and potentially lead to predictable or unfair outcomes in the `draw()` function.",899,95,4.082125425338745
129,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `resetInvestment` function, where the condition `if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp+ONE_MINUTE) throw;` is used to prevent the reset from happening too soon after the last investment. However, miners have the ability to manipulate the timestamp within a certain range, which could allow an attacker to bypass this condition by mining a block with a timestamp that is just over the `lastInvestmentTimestamp + ONE_MINUTE`. This would enable the attacker to call `resetInvestment` and potentially drain the funds.",1179,144,6.130488395690918
130,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same lines as the previous code:

- Line 18: `require(now!= pastBlockTime);`
- Line 20: `pastBlockTime = now;`

These lines ensure that only one transaction per block can successfully execute the `if(now % 15 == 0)` condition, which transfers the contract's balance to the sender. However, miners have some leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, which can be manipulated to a certain extent. This means that a miner could potentially delay the block timestamp to manipulate the outcome of the `if(now % 15 == 0)` condition, allowing multiple transactions to execute the condition within a short time frame.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who can control a mining node, allowing them to manipulate the block timestamp and potentially execute the `if(now % 15 == 0)` condition multiple times within a short time frame. This could lead to multiple transfers of the contract's balance to the attacker, resulting in a loss of funds for the contract.",751,260,10.752249240875244
131,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same line as the first contract:

An attacker with enough hash power could influence the block timestamps to control the outcome of the random number generation, potentially winning the lottery multiple times or avoiding paying fees.",965,109,4.657204866409302
132,short addresses," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to short address attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `sendCoin` function handles the `to` address. The `to` address is passed as a parameter without type checking or validation, which means an attacker could pass a short address (a shorter version of a valid Ethereum address) that still resolves to a valid address due to the way Ethereum addresses are encoded.

In Ethereum, addresses are 20-byte (160-bit) values, but they are often represented as 40-digit hexadecimal numbers. A short address is a 40-digit hexadecimal number that represents the same address as a 42-digit hexadecimal number (the full address). When a short address is used in a transaction, the Ethereum client may interpret it as a valid address, even though it is not the full address.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to send Ether to a different address than intended. For example, if a user has 1 Ether in their account and sends it to a short address, the attacker could claim the Ether sent to the full address that the short address resolves to.

To fix this vulnerability, the smart contract should validate the `to` address to ensure it is a full address and not a short address.",958,301,12.439297199249268
133,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. An attacker can repeatedly call the `addCreditors` function to fill the `creditorAddresses` array until it reaches a length greater than 1500. Once this happens, the `emptyCreditors` function will be triggered, which clears the entire `creditorAddresses` array. This can be done repeatedly, causing the contract to be unable to process legitimate transactions or functions that rely on the `creditorAddresses` array, effectively denying service to legitimate users.",923,137,5.7860565185546875
134,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles the dynamic array `array`. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the array is being resized:

Line 18-22:
```
for(uint i=0;i<numbers;i++) {
    if(numElements == array.length) {
        array.length += 1;
    }
    array[numElements++] = value;
}
```

The issue here is that Solidity does not allow resizing an array by directly modifying its length property. The line `array.length += 1;` is not valid Solidity code and will result in a compilation error. However, the intention behind this line is to resize the array when it reaches its current length.

The correct way to resize an array in Solidity is to use the `push` method, which automatically resizes the array and adds the element to the end. The vulnerability arises because the code attempts to resize the array manually, which is not allowed in Solidity.

To fix this vulnerability, the `insertNnumbers` function should be updated to use the `push` method:

136,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));
```

This line attempts to send the refund amount to each address in the `refundAddresses` array. However, if any of the addresses in the array is a contract that does not have a fallback function or has a fallback function that reverts the transaction, the entire transaction will fail. This is because the `require` statement will cause the transaction to revert if the `send` function call fails.

In a DoS attack scenario, an attacker could deploy a malicious contract to one of the addresses in the `refundAddresses` array. When the `refundAll` function is called, the malicious contract would cause the transaction to fail, preventing the refunds from being sent to the other addresses in the array. This would effectively deny service to the legitimate users of the contract.",950,246,10.266676664352417
137,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function of the `DosOneFunc` contract. An attacker can repeatedly call this function, causing the `listAddresses` array to fill up with the attacker's address. When the array reaches its maximum size of 1500, the function will reset the array to an empty array. This can be done indefinitely, causing the contract to consume resources and potentially leading to a denial of service for legitimate users trying to interact with the contract.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you can introduce a limit on the number of times the `ifillArray` function can be called by a single address or implement a mechanism to prevent the same address from being added to the `listAddresses` array multiple times.",768,191,7.926228284835815
