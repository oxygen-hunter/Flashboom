11,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function in the `MultiOwnable` contract. The issue is that the `newOwner` function allows any user to become an owner of the contract by calling the function and passing their address as the `_owner` parameter. This means that any user can become an owner without the consent of the current owners, which is a significant access control issue.

The `newOwner` function should only allow the current owner (root) to add new owners, not any user. This can be fixed by adding a check in the `newOwner` function to ensure that only the current owner can call it. Here's an updated version of the `MultiOwnable` contract with the fix:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.23;

contract MultiOwnable {
  address public root;
  mapping (address => address) public owners;

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `msg.sender` in the `missing()` function to set the `owner` variable. This allows any user to call the `missing()` function and become the owner of the contract, bypassing the intended access control mechanism.",766,64,2.77960467338562
13,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the `msg.sender` check in the `DynamicPyramid` function. This function allows any user to call it and set the `creator` variable to their address. This means that any user can become the owner of the contract, which can lead to unauthorized access and control over the contract's functionality.

To fix this vulnerability, the `DynamicPyramid` function should only be callable by the original deployer of the contract or a designated admin address. This can be achieved by using a modifier that checks if the `msg.sender` is the deployer or admin address.",3427,143,6.85919451713562
14,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function, specifically in line 20:

require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);

This line allows any user to withdraw their balance, but it does not prevent the user from withdrawing more than their balance. The `require` statement checks if the requested amount is greater than or equal to the user's balance, but it does not prevent the user from requesting more than their balance. This can lead to a situation where a user can drain the contract's funds by repeatedly calling the `withdraw` function with an amount greater than their balance.

To fix this vulnerability, the `require` statement should be modified to check if the requested amount is less than or equal to the user's balance:

require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);

This change ensures that users can only withdraw their balance or a portion of it, preventing them from draining the contract's funds.",968,226,9.398413181304932
15,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being updated with the `totalSupply` amount to the address `0x290a76806ec39e731877b8874a32761d60321bcd` before the constructor finishes execution. This means that if the constructor is called multiple times (which can happen in a deployment scenario), the `balanceOf` mapping will be overwritten, leading to incorrect balances.

This is a reentrancy-like issue, where the state of the contract is being modified before the constructor has finished executing. This can lead to incorrect balances and potentially other issues if the contract is interacted with before the constructor has finished.

To fix this issue, the `balanceOf` mapping should be updated after the constructor has finished executing, ensuring that the initial supply is correctly distributed to the intended address.",783,235,9.731488943099976
16,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `set` function (line 20), which allows anyone to modify the `map` array by providing a `key` and a `value`. This means that any user can overwrite the values in the `map` array, potentially leading to unauthorized changes and data loss.

To fix this vulnerability, you should implement proper access control mechanisms, such as using a modifier to restrict access to the `set` function only to the owner or authorized users.",868,123,5.234827756881714
17,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in the `Proxy` contract. The `forward` function in the `Proxy` contract allows any contract to execute its code within the context of the `Proxy` contract, which can lead to unintended access control issues if the `callee` contract is not trusted.",720,77,3.307973623275757

19,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. The `onlyowner` modifier checks if the `msg.sender` is equal to the `owner`, which is fine for simple cases. However, the issue arises when the contract is used in conjunction with other contracts or libraries that use `tx.origin` for access control.

In this case, the `CustomToken` contract inherits from the `BaseToken` contract, which may have its own access control logic using `tx.origin`. If the `BaseToken` contract uses `tx.origin` for access control, it could bypass the `onlyowner` modifier in the `Missing` contract, allowing unauthorized users to call the `withdraw` function.

To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a more secure access control mechanism, such as using a whitelist of authorized addresses or implementing a more robust access control system that does not rely on `tx.origin`.",769,224,9.277863264083862

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `msg.sender` in the `initWallet` function without proper access control. This allows any user to set the `creator` address, which is then used as a guard in the `migrateTo` function to prevent unauthorized migration of funds. An attacker could exploit this by calling `initWallet` and setting the `creator` to their own address, then calling `migrateTo` to transfer all the funds to their address.",995,117,4.98189640045166

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `refund` function, which uses `msg.sender.transfer(balances[msg.sender]);` to send the balance back to the caller. This can be exploited by an attacker who calls the `refund` function, as it does not properly check if the caller is authorized to withdraw the funds. An attacker could potentially call this function and drain the funds from the contract.",1027,109,4.679776906967163
23,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The contract is assigning the entire token supply to a single address (0x290a76806ec39e731877b8874a32761d60321bcd) during deployment. This means that only the deployer of the contract has control over the entire token supply, which is a significant access control issue.

This can lead to various problems, such as the deployer being able to manipulate the token supply, or other contracts or users being unable to interact with the contract in a fair and decentralized manner. To mitigate this issue, the token supply should be distributed among multiple addresses or handled in a more secure and decentralized manner.",660,192,7.96739935874939
24,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The `changeOwner` function in the `Unprotected` contract allows anyone to change the owner of the contract by calling `changeOwner(_newOwner)` with the desired address. However, the `CustomToken` contract inherits from `Unprotected` and does not override the `changeOwner` function.

In the constructor of `CustomToken`, the initial owner is set to `0x290a76806ec39e731877b8874a32761d60321bcd`. This means that the initial owner of the `CustomToken` contract is hardcoded and can be changed by calling the `changeOwner` function from the `Unprotected` contract.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by calling the `changeOwner` function with their own address, effectively taking control of the `CustomToken` contract. This can lead to unauthorized transfers of tokens, manipulation of the contract's state, and other malicious actions.

To fix this vulnerability, the `CustomToken` contract should override the `changeOwner` function and implement proper access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can change the owner of the contract.",764,298,12.314244031906128

26,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in both the `withdraw` function and the fallback function. The `delegatecall` allows the contract to execute code in the context of another contract, which can lead to unintended behavior if the caller is not properly controlled. In this case, the `withdraw` function and the fallback function are allowing any caller to execute the `setFibonacci` function of the `FibonacciLib` contract, which can lead to unautrightful manipulation of the `calculatedFibNumber` value. This can be exploited by an attacker to drain funds from the contract by setting the `calculatedFibNumber` to a high value before calling the `withdraw` function.",1355,170,7.218846082687378

The vulnerability lies in the same lines as the original code you provided:

1. Line 54: owner2.send(sum2);
2. Line 65: owner.send(balance);

In both cases, the contract is using the low-level send function to transfer funds. The send function does not revert the transaction if the transfer fails, and it does not throw an error. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds if the transfer fails for some reason.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the transfer function instead of send. The transfer function will revert the transaction if the transfer fails, providing better error handling and preventing potential loss of funds.

In Solidity version 0.4.18, the `uint` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When subtracting `_value` from `balances[msg.sender]`, if the result is less than zero, it will wrap around to a very large positive number due to the nature of unsigned integer arithmetic. This can lead to an incorrect balance and potentially allow the attacker to drain funds from the contract.

91,bad randomness," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `blockhash` for randomness. The `blockhash` function returns the hash of the block at a given block number. However, this hash is predictable and can be influenced by miners, as they can choose which transactions to include in a block and the order of those transactions. This predictability can be exploited by a malicious user who can observe the blockchain and predict the `blockhash` for future blocks.

In the `settle` function, the contract uses `blockhash(guesses[msg.sender].block)` to generate the answer. Since the `blockhash` is predictable, a malicious user can observe the blockchain and predict the `blockhash` for the block number specified in the `guesses` mapping. This allows them to lock in a guess that will match the predicted `blockhash`, thus winning the challenge and receiving the 2 ether reward.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a more secure source of randomness, such as an off-chain random number generation service or a decentralized randomness beacon like Chainlink VRF.",1045,251,10.455092668533325

This can lead to predictable or manipulable outcomes, which can be exploited by a malicious user.

Additionally, the function `rand(uint max)` is marked as `constant private`, which means it can only be called within the contract and not by external contracts or users. This limits the potential for exploitation from outside the contract, but it does not eliminate the vulnerability within the contract itself.

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. In this case, the Collect function is vulnerable to reentrancy because it allows the external contract to call the Put function before the balance is updated.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests that you should first check all conditions, then perform all effects (state changes), and finally interact with external contracts.

Here's an updated version of the Collect function that follows this pattern:

function Collect(uint _am)
    public
    payable
    {
        var acc = Acc[msg.sender];
        if( acc.balance>=MinSum && acc.balance>=_am && now>acc.unlockTime)
        {
            acc.balance-=_am;
            LogFile.AddMessage(msg.sender,_am,""Collect"");

            // Interact with external contracts after state changes
            if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

119,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 52:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (the withdrawal function) and sending Ether to it before updating the balance of the sender. This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `CashOut` function again before the balance update is executed, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance of the sender before calling the external contract. Here's an example of how to fix the `CashOut` function:

```solidity
function CashOut(uint _am)
{
    if(_am<=balances[msg.sender])
    {
        balances[msg.sender]-=_am;
        TransferLog.AddMessage(msg.sender,_am,""CashOut"");

        {
            // The balance update is done before calling the external contract

This line allows the `msg.sender` to make a recursive call to the `Collect` function before the initial execution is complete. If the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract, it can exploit this vulnerability to repeatedly withdraw funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests that you should first perform all checks and effects (state changes) before interacting with external contracts. In this case, you should deduct the `_am` amount from the `acc.balance` before making the external call.

By updating the balance before calling the external contract, the reentrancy attack is mitigated.",1550,295,12.334173202514648
126,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract. The issue is that the contract allows external calls to be made before the state of the contract is updated. In this case, the `userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;` line is executed after the external call, which means that if the external call is a reentrant call, it can withdraw the balance again before the balance is updated to zero.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the state before making any external calls. Here's an example of how the `withdrawBalance` function can be modified to prevent reentrancy attacks:

```solidity
function withdrawBalance() public {
    uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
    userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""");
    require(success);
}
```

By updating the balance first, the contract ensures that the balance is set to zero before any external calls are made, preventing reentrancy attacks.",802,279,11.537426233291626
127,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `isSaleFinished()` function of the `TimedCrowdsale` contract, which relies on the `block.timestamp` to determine if the sale is finished.

128,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation due to the reliance on block.timestamp for both the payOut function and the randomGen function.

129,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `resetInvestment` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp+ONE_MINUTE)
```

This line checks if the current block timestamp is less than the `lastInvestmentTimestamp` plus one minute. An attacker can exploit this by manipulating the block timestamp to be within the allowed time frame, allowing them to call the `resetInvestment` function and reset the jackpot.

The `Attacker` contract also has a recursive call to itself with a decreased gas limit, which can potentially lead to a denial-of-service attack. However, the primary vulnerability in this code is the time manipulation issue in the `resetInvestment` function.",1242,187,7.884628534317017
130,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same lines as the previous code:

- Line 18: require(now!= pastBlockTime); // only 1 transaction per block
- Line 20: pastBlockTime = now;

The issue is that the contract relies on the current time (now) to determine if a transaction is eligible for transferring funds. Miners have some leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, which can be manipulated to a certain extent. This can potentially allow a miner to manipulate the time to make the condition `now % 15 == 0` true, enabling them to transfer funds from the contract.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should use a more reliable source of time or implement a mechanism that makes it harder to manipulate the time condition.",814,196,8.16666579246521
131,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same line as the first contract, line 43:

var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;

133,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `emptyCreditors` function can be called repeatedly to keep clearing the `creditorAddresses` array, which can lead to a situation where the contract is unable to process transactions correctly.

The vulnerability lies in line 16: `if(creditorAddresses.length>1500) {`

The vulnerability lies in line 17: `creditorAddresses = new address[](0);`

The vulnerability lies in line 18: `win = true;`

An attacker can repeatedly call the `addCreditors` function to add addresses to the `creditorAddresses` array, and then call the `emptyCreditors` function to clear the array. This can be done in a loop, causing the contract to continuously clear the array and set the `win` variable to true. This can lead to a Denial of Service attack, as the contract will be unable to process transactions correctly when the `creditorAddresses` array is empty.",986,254,10.545507907867432
134,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles the dynamic resizing of the `array` when inserting elements. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the contract checks if `numElements` is equal to `array.length` and then increments `array.length` by 1.

In Solidity, when you try to access an element of an array at an index that is out of bounds, it will throw an exception and revert the transaction. However, in this code, the contract does not check if the new `numElements` is within the bounds of the `array` after incrementing `array.length`. This can lead to a situation where the contract tries to access an index that is out of bounds, causing the transaction to revert and effectively denying service to the user who initiated the transaction.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the new `numElements` is always within the bounds of the `array` after incrementing `array.length`. One way to do this is by using the `push` method to add elements to the array, which automatically resizes the array and adds the element at the end. Here's an updated version of the `insertNnumbers` function:

function insertNnumbers(uint value, uint numbers",1113,301,12.497363090515137
135,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the reset of the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays when a new credit cycle starts. This can be exploited by repeatedly calling the `lendGovernmentMoney` function, which resets the arrays and potentially drains the contract's balance by repeatedly sending Ether to the `corruptElite` address.",2537,99,4.750571012496948
136,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function, specifically in the line where it sends Ether to the addresses in `refundAddresses`. If any of the addresses in `refundAddresses` is a contract that requires a lot of gas to execute its fallback function, or if it's a contract that has a bug causing it to fail to execute properly, the `refundAll` function will fail and revert. This would cause the entire transaction to fail, effectively denying service to the caller.

Additionally, if the `refundAll` function is called by an attacker with a high gas limit, it could potentially consume a significant amount of gas, leading to a denial of service for other users trying to interact with the contract.",1013,179,7.496493577957153
137,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function of the `DosOneFunc` contract. An attacker can repeatedly call this function, causing the `listAddresses` array to fill up with the attacker's address. Once the array reaches its maximum size of 1500, the function will clear the array by setting it to a new empty array. This process can be repeated indefinitely, causing the contract to consume resources and potentially leading to a Denial of Service condition.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the `ifillArray` function, which will consume gas and potentially overload the contract's execution environment. This can lead to a Denial of Service condition, where the contract becomes unresponsive or unavailable for legitimate users.",831,193,8.030866384506226
138,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the same reason as the first contract. The vulnerability lies in line 23:

require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));

This line of code attempts to send the currentBid amount to the currentFrontrunner. If the currentFrontrunner's address is a contract that does not have a fallback function or a receive function, the transaction will fail, causing the bid function to revert.
