12,access control," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. The issue is that the `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function is called without checking if the `_tokenAddr` address is indeed an ERC20 token contract. If `_tokenAddr` is not an ERC20 token contract, the call will revert, causing the entire `multisend` function to fail and revert all state changes, including the `owner` assignment in the `missing` function.

This vulnerability is known as the ""missing revert reason"" vulnerability. It occurs when a contract fails without providing a clear revert reason, making it difficult to debug and understand the cause of the failure. In this case, the failure happens because the `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function is called without proper validation, and if it fails, the entire `multisend` function reverts.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add a check to ensure that `_tokenAddr` is indeed an ERC20 token contract before calling the `transfer` function.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. The `multisend` function allows the owner to send tokens to multiple addresses without proper access control checks.

The `multisend` function is marked as `onlyOwner`, which means that only the owner of the contract can call this function. However, the function does not check if the `_tokenAddr` is an ERC20 token contract or if the contract has the `transfer` function. This can lead to a vulnerability where an attacker can pass a malicious contract address as `_tokenAddr` and potentially exploit the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `multisend` function should check if the `_tokenAddr` is an ERC20 token contract and if the contract has the `transfer` function before calling it. This can be done using the `IERC20` interface and the `hasCode` function.

Here's an updated version of the `multisend` function with proper access control checks:

The provided code is vulnerable due to the use of `require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);` in the `withdraw` function of the `Wallet` contract. This line allows the `msg.sender` to withdraw an amount equal to or greater than their current balance, which could potentially lead to an underflow if the balance is zero. Although this specific issue might not be a direct access control vulnerability, it is still a problem that can be exploited, especially when combined with other vulnerabilities or in certain contexts.

However, the `Airdropper` contract, which inherits from the `Ownable` contract, does not have access control issues in the provided code snippet. The `multisend` function is only accessible by the `owner` of the contract, as enforced by the `onlyOwner` modifier.",897,186,7.756239652633667

The issue is that the `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function is called without checking if the `_tokenAddr` address is indeed an ERC2EE20 token contract. If `_tokenAddr` is not an ERC20 token contract, the call will revert, causing the entire `multisend` function to fail and revert all state changes made within the function.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add a check to ensure that `_tokenAddr` is an ERC20 token contract before calling the `transfer` function. This can be done by using the `IERC20` interface and calling the `isOwnerOf` function to verify that the `_tokenAddr` address is indeed an ERC20 token contract.

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. The `multisend` function is marked as `onlyOwner`, which means it can only be called by the owner of the contract. However, the `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function is not marked as `onlyOwner`, which means it can be called by anyone.

In the `multisend` function, the `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function is called without any access control checks. This means that if an attacker can somehow call the `multisend` function (e.sin the owner's account), they can also call the `transfer` function of the `ERC20` contract and potentially drain funds from the token contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `transfer` function of the `ERC20` contract should also be marked as `onlyOwner` or another access control mechanism should be implemented to ensure that only authorized users can call it.",797,242,10.011325120925903
17,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the Airdropper contract, specifically in the multisend function. The issue is that the ERC20 token contract's transfer function is called without any access control checks. This means that if an attacker can somehow call the multisend function on the Airdropper contract, they could potentially transfer tokens from the specified ERC20 token contract to any address they want, without any restrictions.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the ERC20 token contract's transfer function is not protected by the Ownable modifier, which is used in the Airdropper contract. The Ownable modifier ensures that only the owner of the contract can call certain functions, but since the ERC20 token contract's transfer function is not part of the Airdropper contract, it is not subject to the same access control checks.

To fix this vulnerability, the multisend function should be modified to include access control checks for the ERC20 token contract's transfer function. This can be done by either using an ERC20 token contract that has access control implemented or by adding access control checks within the multisend function itself.",649,270,11.142507076263428

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control, which can be bypassed by a malicious actor. However, the code snippet you've provided does not contain the `tx.origin` usage. Instead, it uses the `Ownable` contract for access control, which is a better practice. The `Ownable` contract uses the `msg.sender` to check if the caller is the owner, which is a more secure way to handle access control.

However, the vulnerability in the original `Wallet` contract you provided is not present in the `Airdropper` contract. The `Airdropper` contract uses the `Ownable` modifier to restrict the `multisend` function to only the owner. This means that only the owner can call the `multisend` function, which is a secure way to handle access control.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. The `multisend` function is only supposed to be callable by the owner of the contract due to the `onlyOwner` modifier. However, the `onlyOwner` modifier is not correctly implemented.

The correct implementation of the `onlyOwner` modifier should be:

The issue here is that the `revert()` function is used instead of `require()`. The `revert()` function reverts the transaction and forwards all the gas to the caller, while the `require()` function reverts the transaction and sends all the gas to the address specified in the `require()` statement.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in both the `withdraw` and fallback functions of the `FibonacciBalance` contract. The `delegatecall` is used to call a function in the `fibonacciLibrary` contract, which could potentially be controlled by an attacker. If the attacker can deploy a malicious contract with the same selector as `setFibonacci` and deploy it to the same address as `fibonacciLibrary`, they could manipulate the `calculatedFibNumber` value. This could lead to incorrect amounts being transferred during the `withdraw` function, resulting in loss of funds.

Additionally, the `fibonacciLibrary` contract does not have any access control mechanisms to prevent unautrighted calls to its functions. This makes it susceptible to unauthorized access and manipulation of its state.

To fix this vulnerability, you should consider using a more secure access control mechanism, such as the `Ownable` contract, to restrict access to the `fibonacciLibrary` contract.

When this happens, the result wraps around and becomes a smaller number, which can lead to incorrect balances being transferred and potentially allow an attacker to drain funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflows and underflows. Here's an example of how you can modify the `multisend` function to use SafeMath:

Specifically, the line `ERC20(_tokenAddr).transfer(dests[i], 10**18 * values[i]);` can cause an integer overflow if `values[i]` is large enough.

In Solidity, the `uint256` type is an unsigned integer with a maximum value of 2^256 - 1. When performing arithmetic operations, if the result exceeds this maximum value, it will wrap around to zero, causing an integer overflow. In the case of the `multisend` function, if `values[i]` is large enough, the multiplication `10**18 * values[i]` can cause an integer overflow, resulting in a smaller value being passed to the `transfer` function.

This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as sending less tokens than intended, which can be exploited by an attacker. To fix this vulnerability, the code should include checks for integer overflow and underflow, or use a library like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath to perform safe arithmetic operations.",536,270,11.08536434173584

In Solidity, the `uint` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When an overflow occurs, the result wraps around to zero. In this case, if `_secondsToIncrease` is large enough, it could cause the `lockTime` value to wrap around to a smaller value, potentially allowing the user to withdraw their funds earlier than intended.",845,142,5.95469069480896

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the `buy` function on line 25: `balanceOf[msg.sender] += numTokens;` and in the `sell` function on line 33: `msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`.

In Solidity version 0.4.21, the `+=` and `*=` operators do not check for overflows and underflows. This means that if the `numTokens` value is large enough, it can cause an integer overflow or underflow, leading to incorrect calculations and potentially allowing attackers to manipulate the contract's state.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflows and underflows. You can import the SafeMath library and use its functions for addition and multiplication instead of the built-in operators.

Here's an example of how you can use SafeMath to fix the vulnerability:

The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. Specifically, the line `ERC20(_tokenAddr).transfer(dests[i], 10**18 * values[i]);` is prone to integer overflow.

In Solidity, the `**` operator is used for exponentiation, not multiplication. The correct operator for multiplication is `*`. The line should be `ERC20(_tokenAddr).transfer(dests[i], 10 * values[i]);` to correctly multiply the value by 10.

However, even with the corrected multiplication, the code is still vulnerable to integer overflow. The `transfer` function in the `ERC20` contract is called with `10 * values[i]`, which can cause an integer overflow if `values[i]` is large enough.

The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. Specifically, the line `ERC20(_tokenAddr).transfer(dests[i], 10**18 * values[i]);` is vulnerable to integer overflow.

In Solidity, the `**` operator is not supported, and the expression `10**18` is not valid. However, if we assume that the intention was to multiply `values[i]` by 10^18, then the multiplication could result in an integer overflow if `values[i]` is large enough.

An integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is outside the range of the data type. In this case, if the multiplication of `values[i]` by 10^18 exceeds the maximum value of a uint256, it will wrap around to a smaller number, leading to an incorrect transfer amount.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflows. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath in the `multisend` function:

However, the `values` array is of type `uint256`, which is an unsigned integer. If the value in the `values` array is large enough, the multiplication operation can cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect amount being transferred. This can result in the loss of tokens or even the entire balance of the token contract.

2. Line 22: `balances[msg.sender] -= _value;`

The issue arises when the `balances[msg.sender]` is very close to the maximum value of a uint (2^256 - 1). Subtracting `_value` from it could cause an underflow, resulting in a very large value that would allow the user to transfer more tokens than they actually have.

In the `attack` contract, the `supportsToken()` function is marked as external and can be called by any external contract. This function checks if it has been called before, and if not, it calls the `airDrop()` function of the `ModifierEntrancy` contract.

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. In this case, the CashOut function is vulnerable to reentrancy because it allows the external contract to withdraw funds before the balance is updated.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests that you should first perform all checks and effects (updates to the state) before interacting with external contracts. Here's an updated version of the CashOut function:

function CashOut(uint _am)
    public
    payable
    {
        if(_am<=balances[msg.sender]&&block.number>lastBlock)
        {

111,reentrancy," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in line 54, where the contract allows an external call to be made before the state changes are finalized:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

In this line, the contract sends `_am` ether to the `msg.sender` and then checks if the call was successful. However, if the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract with a fallback function designed to reenter the contract, it can call the `Collect` function again before the state changes are finalized. This can lead to multiple withdrawals of funds from the contract, potentially draining the entire balance.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the state before making external calls, or use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which ensures that all state changes are made before any external calls are made.",1581,204,8.674474000930786
112,reentrancy," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. The function transfers tokens to multiple addresses without using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. The Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern suggests that you should first perform all checks and effects (state changes) and then interact with other contracts.

In the `multisend` function, the contract calls `ERC20(_tokenAddr).transfer(dests[i], 10**18 * values[i]);` for each destination address without first updating the state of the contract. This allows a malicious contract to re-enter the `multisend` function and drain funds from the contract before the state is updated.

To fix this vulnerability, you should update the state of the contract before interacting with other contracts. Here's an example of how you can fix the `multisend` function:

```solidity
function multisend(address _tokenAddr, address[] dests, uint256[] values)
    onlyOwner
    returns (uint256) {
    uint256 i = 0;
    while (i < dests.length) {

113,reentrancy," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `EtherBank` contract. The issue is the same as in the first example: the contract allows external calls to be made before the state of the contract is updated.

In the `withdrawBalance` function, the contract sends the user's balance to the `msg.sender` before setting the user's balance to 0. This means that if the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract, it can call the `withdrawBalance` function again before the balance is set to 0, effectively draining the `EtherBank` contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the user's balance before sending the funds. Here's an updated version of the `withdrawBalance` function:

```solidity
function withdrawBalance() {
    userBalances[msg.sender] = userBalances[msg.sender] - amountToWithdraw;
    (msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)(""""))
       .callReturn()
       .callRevert(""unknown error"");
}
```

In this updated version, the user's balance is updated before sending the funds, which prevents the reentrancy attack.",809,301,12.356845617294312
114,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 41:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. In this case, the CashOut function is vulnerable to reentrancy because it allows the msg.sender to call the contract again before the balance is updated. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests that you should first perform all checks and effects (updates to the contract's state) before interacting with external contracts. In the case of the CashOut function, you should first deduct the amount from the sender's balance and then perform the external call.

Here's an updated version of the CashOut function that is not vulnerable to reentrancy:

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (the `msg.sender`) and sending Ether to it before updating the balance of the `Holder` struct. This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `Collect` function before the balance update is completed, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the balance update should be done before the external call, and the contract should use the `transfer` or `send` functions instead of `call.value` to send Ether.",1419,167,7.125743389129639

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function, specifically in line 24, where the contract sends Ether to the caller before updating the sender's balance.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrance` contract. The issue is that the contract allows external calls to be made before the state of the contract is updated. In this case, the `userBalance[msg.sender]` is set to 0 after the external call, but the state change is not reflected in the external call. This allows the external contract to call `withdrawBalance` again before the state change is complete, potentially draining the contract's funds.

126,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. The `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function is called for each recipient in the `dests` array. If the `ERC20` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy, an attacker could create a malicious contract that calls the `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract during the execution of the `transfer` function. This would allow the attacker to drain funds from the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract before the `multisend` function completes its execution.

To fix this vulnerability, the `multisend` function should update the balances of the recipients before calling the `transfer` function of the `ERC2EE` contract.

127,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `isSaleFinished()` function of the `TimedCrowdsale` contract, which checks if the current block's timestamp is greater than or equal to a specific value (1546300800). Since the block timestamp can be manipulated by miners, an attacker could potentially delay the block timestamp to manipulate the outcome of the `isSaleFinished()` function.",612,108,4.533124208450317
128,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `randomGen()` function, which returns `block.timestamp`. Since miners have some leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, this can be manipulated to some extent. This can affect the randomness of the `randomGen()` function and potentially lead to predictable or unfair outcomes in the contract's execution.",891,95,4.077167272567749

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `Roulette` contract, where the `pastBlockTime` is updated with the current time (`now`) in every transaction that meets the `msg.value == 10 ether` condition. This allows a miner to manipulate the timing of transactions to trigger the `if(now % 15 == 0)` condition, potentially leading to unintended transfers of funds.",743,105,4.455339193344116

This line uses block.timestamp to generate a random number, which can be manipulated by miners. An attacker with enough hash power could influence the block timestamps to control the outcome of the random number generation, potentially winning the lottery multiple times or avoiding paying fees.",957,109,4.646216154098511
132,short addresses," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to short address attacks. The vulnerability lies in the `sendCoin` function, which uses the `address` type for the `to` parameter. In Solidity, the `address` type is 20 bytes, but when it is used in a transaction, it is padded to 32 bytes. If an attacker uses a short address (less than 20 bytes), the padding can be manipulated to change the intended recipient of the transaction.

To fix this issue, you should use the `address payable` type for the `to` parameter in the `sendCoin` function. This ensures that the address is always 20 bytes and cannot be manipulated by padding.

Here's the updated `sendCoin` function:

```solidity
function sendCoin(address payable to, uint amount) returns(bool sufficient) {
    if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) return false;
    balances[msgEE.sender] -= amount;
    balances[to] += amount;

133,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `emptyCreditors` function can be called repeatedly to keep clearing the `creditorAddresses` array, which can lead to a situation where the contract is unable to process legitimate transactions or calls to other functions that depend on the `creditorAddresses` array.

This can be exploited by an attacker who repeatedly calls the `emptyCreditors` function, causing the `creditorAddresses` array to be emptied and the `win` variable to be set to true. This can lead to a situation where the contract is unable to process legitimate transactions or calls to other functions that depend on the `creditorAddresses` array, effectively causing a Denial of Service.

To fix this vulnerability, you can add a condition to the `emptyCreditors` function to prevent it from being called repeatedly by the same address or add a limit to the number of times the function can be called within a certain time frame.",915,239,9.921502590179443
134,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the contract attempts to dynamically resize the `array` if `numElements` reaches the current length of the `array`.

In Solidity, arrays are fixed-size data structures, and their size cannot be changed once they are initialized. The line `array.length += 1;` is attempting to increase the size of the array, which is not possible and will result in a panic, causing the transaction to revert. This can be exploited by an attacker by repeatedly calling the `insertNnumbers` function with a large value for `numbers`, causing the contract to panic and potentially exhaust the gas limit of the calling account.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should be modified to allocate enough space for the array before inserting elements, or use a dynamic array type like `uint[]` which can be resized using the `push` method.",1042,220,9.197154998779297
135,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the reset of the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays when a new credit cycle starts. This can be exploited by repeatedly calling the `lendGovernmentMoney` function, which will reset the arrays and potentially prevent legitimate creditors from receiving their funds.",2466,87,4.247721433639526
136,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the use of the `send` function within the `refundAll` function. The `send` function is a low-level transfer function that attempts to send Ether from the contract to an address. It also transfers some gas along with the Ether, which is used to execute the fallback function on the recipient address. If the recipient's fallback function consumes all the gas sent with the Ether, the `send` function will fail, and the entire transaction will revert.

In the `refundAll` function, the contract iterates over the `refundAddresses` array and attempts to send Ether to each address using the `send` function. If any of the `send` operations fail, the entire transaction will revert, and no refunds will be processed. This can be exploited by an attacker who can control one of the addresses in the `refundAddressees` array, causing the transaction to fail and denying service to the other addresses.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the `transfer` function instead of the `send` function, as it does not send any gas to the recipient and will not revert the entire transaction if the transfer fails. Here's an updated version of the `refundAll` function using the `transfer` function:

137,denial of service," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function of the `DosOneFunc` contract. An attacker can repeatedly call this function to fill the `listAddresses` array with their address. Once the array reaches the limit of 1500 addresses, the function will clear the array, but the attacker can keep calling the function to keep refilling the array. This can potentially consume a significant amount of gas and resources on the Ethereum network, leading to a DoS attack.",760,128,5.375997304916382
138,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. The function transfers a large amount of tokens (10^18 * values[i]) to each address in the `dests` array. If an attacker provides a very large array of addresses and corresponding values, the contract will attempt to transfer a huge amount of tokens, potentially exhausting the gas limit and causing the transaction to fail. This can lead to a denial of service as the contract will not be able to perform its intended function.

Additionally, the `transfer` function in the `ERC20` contract does not have any checks to ensure that the sender has enough tokens to perform the transfer. This can lead to a denial of service if an attacker calls the `multisend` function with insufficient token balances for the transfers.",750,207,8.560757875442505
