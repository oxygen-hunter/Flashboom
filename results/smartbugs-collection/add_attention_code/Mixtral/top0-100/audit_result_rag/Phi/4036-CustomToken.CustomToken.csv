11,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function in the `MultiOwnable` contract. The issue is that the `newOwner` function allows any user to become an owner of the contract by calling the function and passing their address as the `_owner` parameter. This means that any user can become an owner without the consent of the current owners, which is a significant access control issue.

The `newOwner` function should only allow the current owners to add new owners to the contract. To fix this vulnerability, the `newOwner` function should be modified to include the `onlyOwner` modifier, ensuring that only the current owners can call this function.

Here's the modified `newOwner` function:

```solidity
function newOwner(address _owner) onlyOwner external returns (bool) {
    require(_owner!= 0);
    owners[_owner] = msg.sender;
    return true;

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `addPayout` function, where the `creator` address is not checked before sending funds to the `Participant` addresses. This means that any user can call the `addPayout` function and send funds to the `Participant` addresses, potentially draining the contract's balance.

To fix this vulnerability, the `addPayout` function should be modified to include a modifier that checks if the caller is the `creator` address before executing the function. This can be done by adding a modifier like `onlyOwner` and applying it to the `addPayout` function.

Here's an example of how the `addPayout` function can be modified to include the `onlyOwner` modifier:

```solidity
modifier onlyOwner {
    require(msg.sender == creator);
    _;
}

function addPayout(uint _fee) public onlyOwner {

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function, specifically in the line `require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);`. This line allows any user to withdraw funds from the contract as long as they have a balance greater than or equal to the amount they are trying to withdraw. This is a problem because it does not properly restrict access to the contract's funds.

A better approach would be to check if the `msg.sender` is the owner of the funds before allowing the withdrawal. This can be achieved by adding an `owner` variable and checking if `msg.sender` is equal to the `owner` in the `withdraw` function.

Here's an updated version of the `withdraw` function:

```solidity

function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount);
    require(msg.sender == owner);
    msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;

In this updated version, the `withdraw` function first checks if the `msg.sender` has a balance greater than or equal to the amount they are trying to withdraw. Then, it checks if the `msg.sender` is the owner of the funds before allowing",954,301,12.390030860900879
15,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being updated with the `totalSupply` amount to the owner's address (`0x5ebc4B61A0E0187d9a72Da21bfb8b45F519cb530`) before the constructor finishes execution. This means that if the constructor is called by an attacker who is not the owner, the attacker could potentially transfer the entire supply to their own address before the `onlyowner` modifier in the `Missing` contract is enforced.

This is a reentrancy vulnerability, where the attacker can call the `transfer` function of the `CustomToken` contract from within the `withdraw` function of the `Missing` contract, before the `onlyowner` check is performed. This allows the attacker to drain the `CustomToken` contract's balance.

To fix this vulnerability, the `CustomToken` contract should be modified to ensure that the `balanceOf` mapping is updated only after the constructor has finished executing and the `onlyowner` check has been enforced.",769,281,11.590201616287231

This can lead to a situation where the `balanceOf` mapping is accessible and modifiable by other contracts or functions before the contract is fully initialized, potentially leading to an incorrect state or unintended behavior.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` contract does not have any access control mechanisms in place, which means that any function within the contract can be called by any external contract or account. This could lead to potential vulnerabilities if the contract's functions are not properly secured.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `balanceOf` mapping is only updated after the constructor has finished executing. You can also add access control mechanisms to the contract's functions to prevent unautrighted access.",755,211,8.737615823745728

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `refund` function, which uses `msg.sender.transfer(balances[msg.sender]);` to send the balance back to the caller. This can be exploited by an attacker who is not the owner of the contract but has some funds in the contract. The attacker can call the `refund` function and transfer the funds to their own address.

To fix this vulnerability, the `refund` function should be restricted to the contract owner only. This can be achieved by adding a modifier that checks if the caller is the owner and using it in the `refund` function. Here's an example of how to fix the vulnerability:

The vulnerability lies in the same line as the previous code:

```solidity
adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);
```

This line is using the low-level `call` function, which is similar to the `call.value` function in the previous code. The `call` function does not check for errors and will not revert the transaction if the call fails. This can lead to unexpected outcomes and potential exploits.

In this case, the `call` function is used to execute a command on an address `adr` with the provided `data`. If the command fails or the address `adr` is not a valid contract, the transaction will not revert, and the funds will still be sent to the contract. This can lead to a loss of funds and potential exploitation of the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a higher-level function like `contractInterface.methodName.transact` or `contractInterface.methodName.call` to execute the command, which will check for errors and revert the transaction if the call fails.",2270,249,11.056135416030884

In this specific contract, the `play` function is responsible for recording the player's address and number, and if there are two players, it calls the `andTheWinnerIs` function to determine the winner and distribute the prize. A malicious user can exploit this by front running the transaction and potentially winning the prize before the original transaction is processed.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract could implement a random delay or use a commit-reveal scheme to prevent front running.

In Solidity, when assigning a value to a mapping, the right-hand side is implicitly converted to the type of the mapping's value type. In this case, the `balanceOf` mapping has a value type of `uint256`. The `totalSupply` variable is also a `uint256`. When assigning `totalSupply` to the `balanceOf` mapping, the value is implicitly converted to `uint256`.

However, the `totalSupply` variable is initialized with a value of `2100000000000000000`, which is a decimal literal. This decimal literal is implicitly converted to a `uint256` value. The problem arises when the decimal literal is too large to fit into a `uint256` value, causing an integer overflow.

3. Line 33: `msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`

In Solidity version 0.4.21, the `*` operator does not check for overflow or underflow. This means that if the result of the multiplication exceeds the maximum value of a uint256, it will wrap around to zero, leading to incorrect calculations and potentially allowing attackers to manipulate the contract's behavior.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflow and underflow. You can import the SafeMath library and use its functions for multiplication and addition.

Here's an updated version of the contract with SafeMath:

83,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `run` function of the `IntegerOverflowMultiTxMultiFuncFeasible` contract. The line `count -= input;` can cause an integer underflow if the `input` is greater than the current value of `count`. In Solidity, when an integer underflow occurs, the value wraps around to the maximum possible value of the integer type, which can lead to unexpected and potentially exploitable behavior.

In this specific case, if the `input` is greater than `count`, the subtraction operation will result in a negative value. However, since `count` is of type `uint256`, which is an unsigned integer, the result will wrap around to a very large positive value. This can lead to incorrect behavior in the contract, such as allowing an attacker to manipulate the `count` variable in a way that was not intended by the contract's author.",705,209,8.672581195831299
84,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the `CustomToken()` constructor function. The line `balanceOf[0x5ebc4B61A0E0187d9a72Da21bfb8b45F519cb530] = totalSupply;` is vulnerable to integer overflow.

In Solidity, when assigning a value to a mapping, the right-hand side of the assignment is implicitly converted to the type of the mapping's value type. In this case, the `balanceOf` mapping has a value type of `uint256`. The `totalSupply` variable is also a `uint256`.

However, the `totalSupply` is set to `2100000000000000000`, which is a very large number. When assigning this value to the `balanceOf` mapping, there is a risk of integer overflow if the `balanceOf` mapping already has a non-zero value for the address `0x5ebc4B61A0E0187d9a72Da21bfbEEEEEE`.

In Solidity, when assigning a value to a mapping, the right-hand side of the assignment is implicitly converted to the type of the mapping's value. In this case, the `balanceOf` mapping has a type of `uint256`, and `totalSupply` is also a `uint256`. However, the `totalSupply` value is set to `2100000000000000000`, which is a very large number.

When assigning this large value to the `balanceOf` mapping, there is a risk of integer overflow. If the `balanceOf` mapping is not initialized or has a smaller value than `totalSupply`, the assignment operation may cause an overflow, leading to an incorrect balance value.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. This is because it uses Solidity version 0.4.23, which does not have built-in overflow checks. The operations in the functions `overflowaddtostate`, `overflowmultostate`, `underflowtostate`, `overflowlocalonly`, `overflowmulocalonly`, and `underflowlocalonly` can lead to integer overflow and underflow issues.",1021,97,4.170767784118652
87,arithmetic," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the same type of arithmetic overflow issue as the first example. The vulnerability lies in the `transfer` function, specifically in the lines:

```solidity
require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
```

In Solidity version 0.4.18, the `uint` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When subtracting `_value` from `balances[msg.sender]`, if the result is negative, it will wrap around to a very large positive number due to the nature of unsigned integer arithmetic. This can lead to an incorrect balance update and potentially allow the attacker to drain funds from the contract.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the `CustomToken()` constructor function. The line `balanceOf[0x5ebc4B61A0E0187d9a72Da21bfb8b45F519cb530] = totalSupply;` is vulnerable to integer overflow.

In Solidity, when assigning a value to a variable, if the value is larger than the maximum value the variable can hold, it will wrap around to the minimum value. In this case, the `balanceOf` mapping is of type `uint256`, which can hold a maximum value of 2^256 - 1. The `totalSupply` is set to 2100000000000000000, which is a large number but still within the range of `uint256`.

However, the issue arises when the `balanceOf` mapping is accessed using the address `0x5ebc4B61A0E0187d9a72Da21bfb8bEE519cb530`. This address is the same as the `msg.sender` in the `CustomToken()` constructor function. When the",591,301,12.336137533187866

The vulnerability lies in the `add` function of the `Overflow` contract. When the `value` parameter is added to `sellerBalance`, there is no check to ensure that the result does not overflow the maximum value that a uint type can hold. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploitation.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin or implement a check to prevent overflow before performing the addition operation. Here's an example of how you can fix the vulnerability using SafeMath:

```solidity

The vulnerability lies in the line where the `_value` is added to the balance of the `_to` address:

```solidity
balanceOf[_to] += _value;
```

In Solidity, the `+=` operator performs an addition and then assigns the result back to the variable. If the result of the addition exceeds the maximum value that a `uint256` can hold (which is 2^256 - 1), it will wrap around to 0, causing an integer overflow. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the balances in the contract.

Additionally, the use of block.number as a source of randomness is also problematic. The block number is predictable and can be influenced by miners, which can lead to predictable outcomes in the raffle.

The vulnerability lies in the randomness generation function `rand(uint max)` which is used to determine which entry gets paid. The function uses the block hash of the last block to generate a pseudo-random number. However, miners have some control over the block hash, and they can influence the outcome of the function by choosing a block hash that results in a specific pseudo-random number. This could allow a miner to favor their own entry or manipulate the payouts in a way that benefits them.

Additionally, the contract does not have a mechanism to ensure that the same entry is not paid multiple times. If a miner can influence the randomness, they could potentially cause their own entry to be paid multiple times, leading to an unfair distribution of funds.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should use a more secure source of randomness, such as an oracle or a decentralized randomness beacon, which would make it more difficult for miners to manipulate the outcome.",3458,221,10.153252601623535

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function, specifically in line 24, where the contract sends Ether to the `msg.sender` before updating the `userBalance`. This allows a malicious contract to call the `withdrawBalance` function recursively before the balance is updated, potentially draining the contract's funds.",848,95,4.057542562484741
119,reentrancy," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 52:

```solidity

```

In this line, the contract is sending Ether to the `msg.sender` before updating the balance. If the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract with a fallback function that calls back into the `CashOut` function, it can withdraw more Ether than it should, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance before sending Ether to the `msg.sender`. Here's an updated version of the `CashOut` function:

```solidity
function CashOut(uint _am)
{
    if(_am<=balances[msg.sender])
    {
        balances[msgEE]-=_am;
        TransferLog.AddMessage(msg.sender,_am,""CashOut"");

        {
            // The balance has already been updated, so this line is safe
        }
    }
}
```

By updating the balance before sending Ether, the contract is no longer vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.",1490,299,12.469713926315308
120,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 38:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (the `msg.sender`) and sending Ether to it before updating the balance of the sender. This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `CashOut` function before the balance update is completed, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance of the sender before sending Ether to the external contract. This can be done by moving the balance update line before the external call:

```solidity
balances[msg.sender] -= _am;
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This way, even if the external contract calls back into the `CashOut` function, the balance has already been updated, preventing the reentrancy attack.",1344,232,9.729816436767578

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (the msg.sender) and sending Ether to it before updating the balances. If the external contract is malicious and has a fallback function that calls back into the `Collect` function of the `PRIVATE_ETH_CELL` contract, it can potentially withdraw more Ether than it should, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balances before sending Ether to the external contract. Here's an example of how to fix the vulnerability:

The vulnerability lies in line 40:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the CashOut function to be called recursively by an external contract before the initial execution is complete. If an attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the CashOut function, they can drain the funds from the Private_Bank contract before the balance update is executed.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance before calling the external contract, or use checks-effects-interactions pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks.",1360,148,6.343379497528076
123,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 29:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the `msg.sender` to make a recursive call to the `Collect` function before the initial execution is complete. If the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract, it can exploit this vulnerability to repeatedly call the `Collect` function and drain the funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests that you should first perform all checks and effects (state changes) before interacting with external contracts. In this case, you should deduct the `_am` amount from the `acc.balance` before making the external call.

Here's an updated version of the `Collect` function:

function Collect(uint _am)

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (the msg.sender) and sending Ether to it before updating the balance. If the external contract is malicious and has a fallback function that calls back into the `Collect` function of the `BANK_SAFE` contract, it can potentially withdraw more funds than it should be allowed to. This is because the balance update (`balances[msg.sender]-=_am;`) is not executed until after the external call returns, allowing the malicious contract to drain funds from the `BANK_SAFE` contract.",1536,183,7.784196853637695
126,reentrancy," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract. The issue is that the contract allows external calls to be made before the state of the contract is updated. In this case, the `userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;` line is executed after the external call, which means that if the external call is a reentrant call, it can withdraw the balance again before the balance is updated to zero.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the state before making any external calls. Here's an example of how the `withdrawBalance` function can be modified to prevent reentrancy attacks:

```solidity
function withdrawBalance() public {
    uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
    userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""");
    require(success);
}
```

By updating the `userBalances[msg.sender]` to zero before making the external call, the contract ensures that the balance cannot be withdrawn again during a reentrant call.",788,287,11.824039936065674
127,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `isSaleFinished()` function of the `TimedCrowdsale` contract, which relies on `block.timestamp` to determine if the sale is finished.

129,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `resetInvestment` function, where the condition `if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp+ONE_MINUTE) throw;` is used to prevent the reset from happening too soon after the last investment. However, miners have the ability to manipulate the timestamp within a certain range, which could allow an attacker to bypass this condition and reset the investment prematurely.",1228,106,4.593583106994629
130,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same lines as the previous code:

- Line 18: `require(now!= pastBlockTime);`
- Line 20: `pastBlockTime = now;`

These lines ensure that only one transaction per block can transfer the balance to the sender. However, miners have some leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, which can be manipulated to a certain extent. This means that a miner could potentially delay the block confirmation to manipulate the timing of the transfer, allowing multiple transfers to occur within a short time frame.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should not rely solely on the block timestamp for critical operations. Instead, it could use a combination of block timestamps and other factors, such as block numbers or a decentralized time oracle, to make the contract more resistant to time manipulation attacks.",800,211,8.777501344680786
131,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same line as the first contract, line 43:

var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;

This line uses block.timestamp to generate a random number, which can be manipulated by miners. An attacker with control over the mining process could manipulate the block timestamp to influence the outcome of the random number generation, potentially affecting the distribution of winnings in the EtherLotto contract.",1014,117,4.989994525909424
132,short addresses," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to short address attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `sendCoin` function handles the `to` address. The `to` address is passed as a parameter without type checking or validation, which can lead to short address attacks if the address is not properly padded.

In Solidity, addresses are 20-byte values, but when passed as arguments, they can be padded with leading zeros. If a malicious user sends a transaction with a short address (less than 20 bytes), the EVM will accept the padded address, and the contract will process the transaction with the short address. This can lead to funds being sent to an unintended recipient.

To fix this vulnerability, the `sendCoin` function should validate the `to` address to ensure it is a full 20-byte address before processing the transaction.",1007,196,8.207044124603271
133,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. An attacker can repeatedly call the `addCreditors` function to fill the `creditorAddresses` array until it reaches a length of 1500. Once this threshold is reached, the `emptyCreditors` function will be triggered, which clears the `creditorAddresses` array and sets the `win` variable to true. This can be exploited to disrupt the contract's intended functionality by repeatedly adding and removing creditors, effectively causing a DoS condition.",972,135,5.720805883407593
134,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles the dynamic resizing of the `array`. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the contract checks if `numElements` is equal to `array.length` and then increments `array.length` by 1.

In Solidity, when you try to access an array element that doesn't exist, it will throw an exception and revert the transaction. However, in this case, the contract is not checking if the new `array.length` is actually within bounds before trying to access the array at `numElements`. This can lead to an out-of-bounds access, causing the transaction to revert and effectively creating a denial of service.

To fix this vulnerability, you should remove the line `array.length += 1;` and instead use the `push` method to add elements to the array, which will automatically resize the array as needed. Here's the updated `insertNnumbers` function:

```solidity
function insertNnumbers(uint value, uint numbers) public {
    for(uint i = 0; i < numbers; i++) {
        array.push(value);
    }

The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function, specifically in the line where it sends Ether to the addresses in `refundAddresses`. If any of the addresses in `refundAddresses` is a contract that requires a lot of gas to execute its fallback function, or if it's a contract that has a bug causing it to fail to execute properly, the `send` operation will fail. Since the `require` statement is used, the entire `refundAll` function will revert if any single `send` fails, effectively causing a denial of service as the function will not complete successfully for any of the addresses.",999,153,6.448319435119629
137,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function of the `DosOneFunc` contract. An attacker can repeatedly call this function, causing the `listAddresses` array to fill up with the attacker's address. Once the array reaches its maximum size of 1500, the function will clear the array by setting it to a new empty array. This process can be repeated indefinitely, causing the contract to consume resources and potentially leading to a Denial of Service condition.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the `ifillArray` function, which will consume gas and potentially overload the contract's resources. This can lead to a Denial of Service condition, where the contract becomes unresponsive or unavailable to legitimate users.",817,192,8.016341209411621
