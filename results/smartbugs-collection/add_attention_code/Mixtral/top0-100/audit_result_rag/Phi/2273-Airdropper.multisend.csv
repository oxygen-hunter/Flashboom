11,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function of the `MultiOwnable` contract. The issue is that the `newOwner` function allows any user to become an owner of the contract without proper authorization checks.

In the `newOwner` function, the `require` statement checks if the `_owner` address is not zero, but it does not verify if the caller has the necessary permissions to add a new owner. This means that any user can call the `newOwner` function and add themselves or any other address as an owner, which can lead to unautrightful control over the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `newOwner` function should be modified to include an authorization check, ensuring that only the root owner or other authorized users can add new owners. This can be achieved by using the `onlyOwner` modifier or a similar access control mechanism.",1029,200,8.383881092071533

The `multisend` function is marked as `public` and has the `onlyOwner` modifier, which means it can only be called by the contract's owner. However, the vulnerability arises from the fact that the `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function is not explicitly marked as `public`.

In Solidity, if a function is not explicitly marked as `public`, it is implicitly `internal`. This means that the function can only be called by the contract itself or contracts derived from it. In the case of the `Airdropper` contract, it is not derived from the `ERC20` contract, so it cannot call the `transfer` function directly.

To fix this vulnerability, the `transfer` function in the `ERC20` contract should be marked as `public`, allowing the `Airdropper` contract to call it without any issues.

Here's the updated `ERC20` contract:

The vulnerability lies in the `addPayout` function, where the `creator` address is not checked before sending Ether to the `Participant` addresses. This means that any user can call the `addPayout` function and send Ether to the `Participant` addresses, potentially draining the contract's balance.

To fix this vulnerability, the `addPayout` function should be modified to include a check that ensures only the `creator` can call it. This can be done by adding a modifier like `onlyOwner` and applying it to the `addPayout` function. Here's an example of how the modified function would look:

```solidity

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. The `multisend` function is marked as `public` and has a modifier `onlyOwner` that restricts its execution to the contract owner. However, the `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function is not restricted by the `onlyOwner` modifier, which means that any user can call the `transfer` function on the ERC20 token contract.

This can lead to a vulnerability if the `_tokenAddr` address passed to the `multisend` function is an ERC20 token contract that is controlled by an attacker. The attacker can call the `multisend` function on the `Airdropper` contract and transfer tokens from the ERC2EE token contract to their own address.

To fix this vulnerability, the `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function should also be restricted by the `onlyOwner` modifier or by a similar access control mechanism.",892,244,10.107203960418701
15,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. The issue is that the `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function is called without checking if the `_tokenAddr` address is actually an ERC20 token contract. If `_tokenAddr` is not an ERC20 token contract, the call will revert, causing the entire `multisend` function to fail and revert all state changes, including the transfers to the intended recipients.

This vulnerability is known as the ""ERC20 token contract address validation vulnerability"" and can be exploited by an attacker by providing a malicious contract address as the `_tokenAddr` argument. The attacker can then create a contract that reverts when called, causing the `multisend` function to fail and preventing the legitimate transfers from happening.

To fix this vulnerability, the `multisend` function should validate that `_tokenAddr` is an ERC2EE20 token contract before calling its `transfer` function. This can be done by checking the `_tokenAddr`'s code hash against the expected ERC20 code hash.",707,271,11.177314519882202

This means that an attacker could potentially overwrite the `owner` address in the `Map` contract by calling the `set` function with a key that corresponds to the `owner` variable in the `Ownable` contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `map` array should be made private and access to it should be controlled through a public function that checks for proper authorization before allowing modifications.

The issue is that the `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function is not called with the `onlyOwner` modifier, which means that any user can call the `multisend` function and perform airdrops to any address with any amount of tokens. This is a significant access control issue, as it allows unauthorized users to transfer tokens from the contract'sinternal storage.

To fix this vulnerability, the `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function should be called within the `onlyOwner` modifier in the `multisend` function, ensuring that only the owner can perform airdrops. Here's an example of how the `multisend` function should be modified:

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control, which can be bypassed by a malicious actor. However, the code snippet you've provided does not contain the `tx.origin` usage. Instead, it uses the `Ownable` contract, which is a common pattern for implementing access control in Solidity contracts.

The `Ownable` contract uses the `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict certain functions to the contract owner. In the `Airdropper` contract, the `multisend` function is restricted by the `onlyOwner` modifier, meaning only the owner can call this function.

However, the vulnerability in the `Airdropper` contract lies in the `multisend` function. The function takes an array of destination addresses and an array of values to transfer. If an attacker can control the input arrays, they can potentially cause the contract to transfer more tokens than intended or to unintended addresses.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should add additional checks to ensure that the input arrays are of the same length and that the values are within acceptable limits. Additionally, you should consider using a more secure access control mechanism, such as using a whitelist of authorized addresses or implementing a more robust permission system.",926,289,11.976138830184937

The issue arises when the `multisend` function is called by the owner. The `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function is called within the `multisend` function, and since it is public, it can be called by anyone. This means that an attacker can call the `transfer` function directly, bypassing the access control implemented in the `multisend` function.

To fix this vulnerability, the `ERC2EE` contract should be used instead of the `ERC20` contract, or the `transfer` function in the `ERC20` contract should be marked as `internal` or `private` to restrict access to it.",693,264,10.862648487091064

This means that they can then call the `migrateTo` function to transfer all funds to another address, effectively stealing the funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `creator` should be set in the constructor of the contract and not be modifiable. Additionally, the `migrateTo` function should be removed or properly secured to prevent unauthorized transfers.",919,184,7.705169200897217

However, the vulnerability arises from the fact that the `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function is not explicitly defined with the `onlyOwner` modifier or any other access control mechanism.

An attacker could create a malicious ERC20 token contract that calls the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract, potentially leading to unauthorized transfers of tokens. This is because the `multisend` function does not check if the `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function has proper access control.

The `multisend` function is marked as `public` and has the `onlyOwner` modifier, which means it can only be called by the owner of the contract. However, the `onlyOwner` modifier is inherited from the `Ownable` contract, and the `owner` variable is not set in the `Airdropper` contract.

In the `Ownable` contract, the `owner` variable is set in the constructor, but the `Airdropper` contract does not have a constructor to set the `owner`. This means that the `owner` variable in the `Airdropper` contract will be `address(0)` (the zero address) by default. As a result, the `onlyOwner` modifier will always fail, and the `multisend` function will not work as intended.

To fix this vulnerability, the `Airdropper` contract should inherit from the `Ownable` contract and set the `owner` variable in its constructor. Here's an example of how the `Airdropper` contract should be written:

In the `play` function, the state change occurs when a player's information is added to the `players` array, which is public. This information can be observed by other users, and a malicious user can exploit this by sending a higher-fee transaction to preempt the original transaction.",1108,118,5.050819635391235

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract, specifically in the line where the `transfer` function of the `ERC20` contract is called:

```solidity
ERC20(_tokenAddr).transfer(dests[i], values[i]);
```

In Solidity, the `transfer` function of the `ERC20` contract subtracts the `value` from the sender's balance and adds it to the receiver's balance. If the sender's balance is not sufficient to cover the `value`, it will result in an integer underflow, causing the sender's balance to wrap around to a very large number. This can be exploited by an attacker to drain funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the `SafeMath` library from OpenZeppelin Contracts, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflow and underflow. Here's an example of how to use it:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.11;

import ""https://github.com/OpenZeppelinSolidity/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/math/Sa",564,301,12.306385278701782
78,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. Specifically, the issue is with the line:

```solidity
ERC20(_tokenAddr).transfer(dests[i], values[i]);
```

In Solidity, the `transfer` function of the `ERC20` contract can cause an integer overflow if the value being transferred is greater than the current balance of the token contract. This is because the `transfer` function first subtracts the value from the sender's balance and then adds it to the receiver's balance. If the sender's balance is close to the maximum value of a uint256 (2^256 - 1), subtracting the value can cause an underflow, resulting in a very large positive number. When this incorrect balance is added to the receiver's balance, it can cause an overflow, resulting in a smaller positive number.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the `safeTransfer` function instead of `transfer`, which checks for overflow and underflow conditions and reverts the transaction if they occur. Here's an updated version of the `multisend` function:

```solidity
function multisend(address _tokenAddr, address[] dest",534,301,12.309113264083862
79,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. Specifically, the issue is with the `while` loop condition:

```solidity
while (i < dests.length) {
  ERC20(_tokenAddr).transfer(dests[i], values[i]);
  i += 1;
}
```

In Solidity 0.4.25, the `dests.length` property is not checked at runtime, and the length is calculated at compile time. If the `dests` array is empty, the loop condition `i < dests.length` will always be true, causing an infinite loop. This can lead to a denial of service attack, as the contract will be stuck in an infinite loop, and the attacker can repeatedly call the `multisend` function without any termination.

To fix this vulnerability, you can add a check for the length of the `dests` array before entering the loop:

```solidity
if (dests.length > 0) {
  while (i < dests.length) {
    ERC20(_tokenAddr).transfer(dests[i], values[i]);

The vulnerability lies in the `Airdropper` contract's `multisend` function, specifically in the loop where it calls `ERC20(_tokenAddr).transfer(dests[i], values[i]);`. If the `values[i]` array contains a value that, when subtracted from the token balance, causes an underflow, it could lead to an integer underflow vulnerability. This could potentially be exploited to manipulate the token balances in an unintended way.",531,126,5.250937461853027
81,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to an integer overflow in the `increaseLockTime` function. The vulnerability lies in line 22:

```solidity

```

In Solidity, the `uint` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When an overflow occurs, the result wraps around to zero. In this case, if `_secondsToIncrease` is large enough, the `lockTime` value could wrap around to zero, effectively resetting the lock time to zero and allowing the user to withdraw their funds immediately.",840,144,6.041470766067505

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the following lines:

1. Line 23: `require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`
2. Line 25: `balanceOf[msg.sender] += numTokens;`
3. Line 33: `msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`

In Solidity version 0.4.21, the `*` operator does not check for overflow or underflow. This means that if the result of the multiplication exceeds the maximum value of a uint256, it will wrap around to zero, leading to incorrect calculations and potentially allowing attackers to manipulate the contract's behavior.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflow and underflow. You can import the library and use its functions for multiplication and addition.

Here's an example of how to use SafeMath to fix the vulnerability:

```solidity

83,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. Specifically, the issue is with the loop that iterates over the `dests` and `values` arrays to send tokens. If the sum of the `values` array elements exceeds the maximum value of a uint256 (which is 2^256 - 1), an integer overflow will occur. This can lead to an incorrect amount of tokens being sent, potentially causing underflows or overflows in the balances of the recipients.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflows and underflows. Here's an example of how you can modify the `multisend` function to use SafeMath:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.23;

84,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `Airdropper` contract, specifically in the `multisend` function. The issue is that the function does not check if the `values[i]` (the amount of tokens to be transferred) is greater than the remaining balance of the token contract. If `values[i]` is greater than the remaining balance, it will cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect balance calculation.

To fix this vulnerability, the `multisend` function should include a check to ensure that the remaining balance of the token contract is greater than or equal to `values[i]` before performing the transfer. This can be done by adding a line like the following before the transfer:

```solidity
require(ERC20(_tokenAddr).balance() >= values[i], ""Insufficient balance"");
```",542,198,8.189167261123657

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow due to the use of unsigned integer operations without proper checks. Solidity version 0.4.23 does not have built-in overflow checks, and the operations in the functions `overflowaddtostate`, `overflowmultostate`, `underflowtostate`, `overflowlocalonly`, `overflowmulocalonly`, and `underflowlocalonly` can lead to overflow and underflow issues.",959,101,4.335109233856201

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the `transfer` function of the `Token` contract, specifically in the lines:

```solidity
require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);

```

In Solidity version 0.4.18, the `uint` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When subtracting `_value` from `balances[msg.sender]`, if the balance is less than `_value`, it will result in an integer underflow, causing the balance to wrap around to a very large number. This can lead to unintended behavior, such as allowing the sender to transfer more tokens than they actually have, potentially leading to theft or denial of service.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflow and underflow. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath in the `transfer` function:

The vulnerability lies in the `transfer` function of the `ERC20` contract, which uses the `transfer` function from the `IntegerOverflowAdd` contract. The `transfer` function in `IntegerOverflowAdd` does not have any checks for integer overflow or underflow, which can lead to vulnerabilities when used in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract.

In the `multisend` function, the `transfer` function from `IntegerOverflowAdd` is called multiple times to transfer tokens to different addresses. If the sum of the values being transferred exceeds the maximum value of a uint250, an integer overflow can occur, leading to incorrect balances and potential exploitation.

To fix this vulnerability, the `transfer` function in the `IntegerOverflowAdd` contract should be modified to include checks for integer overflow and underflow, or the `ERC20` contract should be used with a library that handles these checks, such as OpenZeppelin's `SafeMath` library.",622,245,10.116995811462402

The vulnerability lies in the use of block.number and block.coinbase for generating randomness. Block.number is predictable and can be influenced by miners, and block.coinbase is also predictable as it is the address of the miner who mined the block. This makes the randomness used in the chooseWinner function predictable and potentially exploitable by a malicious user.

Additionally, the use of block.difficulty as a seed for randomness is also not recommended, as it can be influenced by miners and is not a good source of randomness.

1. The `block.blockhash(block.number - 1)` is predictable, as it is the hash of the previous block, which is publicly available information.
2. The `now` variable is also predictable, as it represents the current timestamp, which can be easily obtained by any user.

Because both inputs to the `keccak256` hash function are predictable, a malicious user can replicate the random number generation process and predict the `answer` value.

This line allows the `msg.sender` to call the `withdrawBalance` function again before the state of the contract is updated (i.e., before the balance is set to 0). This can lead to multiple withdrawals being executed in a single transaction, potentially draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the state (i.e., the user's balance) before making the external call. Here's an example of how the `withdrawBalance` function can be modified to prevent the reentrancy attack:

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same lines as the original code you provided:

These lines ensure that only one transaction can be executed per block by comparing the current block timestamp with the previously stored timestamp. However, miners have some leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, which can be exploited to manipulate the block timestamp.

An attacker with enough mining power could mine a block with a timestamp that is just slightly greater than the previous block's timestamp, allowing them to execute the contract's function multiple times within a short time frame. This could lead to multiple transfers of the contract's balance to the `msg.sender`, which is not the intended behavior.",738,196,8.128929376602173

The vulnerability lies in the `sendCoin` function, which does not check for the validity of the `to` address before transferring the tokens. This can lead to a situation where tokens are sent to an invalid or short address, potentially causing the loss of tokens.

The issue is not directly related to the EVM or the smart contract itself, but rather to the interaction between the smart contract and the client. However, it is the responsibility of the smart contract developer to ensure that the contract handles addresses correctly and securely.

To fix this vulnerability, the `sendCoin` function should include a check to ensure that the `to` address is a valid Ethereum address before proceeding with the transfer. This can be done using Solidity's built-in functions like `address(uint160)` or `address(bytes32)`.",945,195,8.144160270690918

The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the contract attempts to dynamically resize the `array` if `numElements` reaches the current length of the `array`.

In Solidity, arrays are fixed-size data structures, and their size cannot be changed once they are initialized. The line `array.length += 1;` is attempting to increase the size of the array, which is not possible and will result in a panic, causing the transaction to revert. This can be exploited by an attacker by repeatedly calling the `insertNnumbers` function with a large number of elements, causing the contract to panic and potentially leading to a Denial of Service.

To fix this vulnerability, you should initialize the `array` with a fixed size that is sufficient to hold the maximum number of elements you expect to store in it. Alternatively, you can use a dynamic array with a fixed maximum size, and ensure that you never exceed this maximum size when inserting elements.",1037,234,9.753464698791504

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the reset of the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays when a new credit cycle starts. This vulnerability is present in the lines:

```solidity
creditorAddresses = new address[](0);

```

When the `lendGovernmentMoney` function is called and the condition `lastTimeOfNewCredit + TWELVE_HOURS < block.timestamp` is met, the contract resets the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays to empty arrays. This means that all the previously stored creditor addresses and amounts are lost, and the contract cannot process any further transactions for those creditors.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the `lendGovernmentMoney` function with a small amount of Ether, causing the contract to reset the arrays and effectively denying service to legitimate creditors. This can lead to a situation where the contract is unable to process any transactions, rendering it inoperable.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should not reset the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays when a new credit cycle starts. Instead, it should maintain the existing arrays",2461,301,13.238173723220825

The `send` function in Solidity can fail for various reasons, such as if the recipient address does not have enough Ether to cover the transaction fee (gas). If any of the `send` operations fail, the entire `refundAll` function will fail due to the `require` statement, preventing the refunding of all addresses. This can be exploited by an attacker who knows the addresses to be refunded and can send transactions to them just before the `refundAll` function is called, causing the function to fail and denying the refunds.",937,161,6.765688180923462
137,denial of service," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function of the `DosOneFunc` contract. An attacker can repeatedly call this function to fill the `listAddresses` array with their address. Once the array reaches its maximum size of 1500, the function will reset the array to an empty array. This can be done indefinitely, effectively denying service to other users who might need to interact with the `listAddressers` array for legitimate purposes.

The vulnerability is not directly related to the `Airdropper` contract, but if the `DosOneFunc` contract is used in conjunction with the `Airdropper` contract, it could potentially impact the `Airdropper` contract's functionality if the `listAddresses` array is used within it.",755,196,8.140224933624268
138,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `bid()` function of the `DosAuction` contract. When a new bid is placed, the contract attempts to send the current highest bid amount to the previous highest bidder (`currentFrontrunner`). If the `currentFrontrunner` is not the zero address (i.e., there is a previous highest bidder), the contract requires that the `currentFrontrunner` sends the `currentBid` amount back to the contract.

This requirement can be exploited by an attacker who can control the `currentFrontrunner` address. The attacker can simply refuse to send the `currentBid` amount, causing the `require` statement to fail and revert the transaction. This would effectively deny service to other users trying to place a bid, as the contract would be stuck in a state where it cannot process new bids until the `currentFrontrunner` sends the `currentBid` amount.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should not require the `currentFrontrunner` to send the `currentBid` amount back to the contract. Instead, the contract could simply update the `currentFrontrunner` and `currentBid` variables without requiring any action from the previous highest bidder.",745,300,12.366091966629028
