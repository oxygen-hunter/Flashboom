The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function (line 38) of the `MultiOwnable` contract. The function allows any user to become an owner by calling it, without any proper authorization checks. This means that any user can become an owner and gain control over the contract's functions that are restricted to owners only.

To fix this vulnerability, the `newOwner` function should be modified to include proper authorization checks, ensuring that only the root owner or the current owner can add new owners. This can be achieved by adding an `onlyOwner` modifier to the `newOwner` function, similar to the `deleteOwner` function.",1048,159,7.083624601364136
12,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, which inherits from the `BaseToken` contract. The `CustomToken` constructor assigns the entire token supply to a single address (0x873c50dcac16d9db1b67d7c6ff596f69981c4c71) and then emits a `Transfer` event to itself. This means that the single address now has full control over the token supply.

An attacker could create a malicious contract that calls the `CustomToken` constructor and then use the `onlyowner` modifier in the `Missing` contract to call the `withdraw` function, effectively draining the entire token supply to their own address. This is a subtle access control bypass, as the `onlyowner` modifier relies on the `owner` variable, which is set in the `missing` function.

To fix this vulnerability, the `CustomToken` constructor should be modified to distribute the token supply among multiple addresses or use a more secure method for assigning the initial token supply. Additionally, the `Missing` contract should be reviewed to ensure that the `owner` variable is set securely and that the `onlyowner` modifier is used correctly.",709,293,12.74589490890503
13,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `addPayout` function, where the `creator` address is not checked before sending Ether to the `Participant` addresses. This means that any user can call the `addPayout` function and send Ether to the `Participant` addresses, potentially draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `addPayout` function should be modified to include a modifier that checks if the caller is the `creator` before executing the function. This can be done by adding a `creatorOnly` modifier and using it in the `addPayout` function, like this:

```solidity
modifier creatorOnly {
    require(msg.sender == creator);
    _;
}

function addPayout(uint _fee) creatorOnly private {
    //...
}
```

This modification ensures that only the `creator` can call the `addPayout` function, preventing unautptacious access to the contract's funds.",3370,248,11.78064489364624
14,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function, specifically in line 20:

```solidity
require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);
```

This line allows any user to withdraw their balance, which is correct. However, the issue arises when considering the `migrateTo` function in the `Wallet` contract. The `migrateTo` function allows the `creator` to transfer the entire balance of the contract to another address. Since the `creator` is the only one who can call this function, it is not an access control issue in itself.

However, if the `CustomToken` contract is deployed using the `Wallet` contract as its constructor, the `creator` of the `CustomToken` contract would also be the `creator` of the `Wallet` contract. This means that the `creator` of the `CustomToken` contract can call the `migrateTo` function of the `Wallet` contract and transfer the entire balance of the `CustomToken` contract to any address.

This is a potential access control issue because the `creator` of the `CustomToken` contract may not be the intended owner of the funds, and they could transfer the funds to an unintended address. To mitigate this issue",911,301,12.71419906616211
15,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, which inherits from the `BaseToken` contract. The issue is with the constructor of the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the line:

```solidity
balanceOf[0x873c50dcac16d9db1b67d7c6ff596f69981c4c71] = totalSupply;
```

This line assigns the entire supply of tokens to the address `0x873c50dcac16d9db1b67d7c6ff596f69981c4c71` during contract deployment. This means that the deployer of the contract has full control over the tokens, which is a significant access control issue.

The `onlyowner` modifier in the `Missing` contract is not sufficient to prevent this vulnerability, as the `CustomToken` contract does not use the `Missing` contract's functionality. The `CustomToken` contract's constructor is executed during deployment, and the `onlyowner` modifier does not apply to it.

To fix this vulnerability, the `CustomToken` contract should be modified to use the `Missing` contract's functionality, ensuring that the token supply",726,301,12.921655893325806
16,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `set` function, specifically in the line `map[key] = value;`. This function allows anyone to modify the `map` array, which could lead to unauthorized changes in the contract's state.

In the provided code, there is no access control mechanism to restrict who can call the `set` function. This means that any user can call the `set` function and modify the `map` array, potentially leading to unintended consequences or manipulation of the contract's data.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add an access control mechanism to restrict who can call the `set` function. One way to do this is by using a modifier that checks if the caller is the owner of the contract. Here's an example of how you can modify the code to add access control:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Map {
    address public owner;

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the access control issue in the `PopBonusCode` function. The condition `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length);` is always true since array lengths are unsigned and cannot be negative. This means that the `PopBonusCode` function can be called without any restrictions, potentially leading to an underflow error if the bonusCodes array is empty.",945,90,4.310251712799072
19,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function. The `CustomToken` contract inherits from the `BaseToken` contract and has a constructor that assigns the entire token supply to a single address (0x873c50dcac16d9db1b67d7c6ff596f69981c4c71) and then logs a transfer event.

The vulnerability is related to the event logging. The `Transfer` event is emitted with the sender as `address(0)`, which is the zero address. This can be exploited by an attacker to create a malicious contract that listens for `Transfer` events with a zero address as the sender. When the `CustomToken` contract is deployed, the malicious contract will receive the event and can potentially use the information for nefarious purposes, such as phishing attacks or impersonation.

To fix this vulnerability, the `CustomToken` constructor should emit the `Transfer` event with the correct sender address, which is the address of the contract itself (this.address).",712,257,10.862807512283325
20,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `migrateTo` function, which allows the `creator` to transfer the contract's balance to any address. Since the `creator` is set in the `initWallet` function and is not protected, any user who calls `initWallet` can set themselves as the `creator`. This allows them to bypass the `require(creator == msg.sender);` check in the `migrateTo` function and transfer the contract's balance to any address they choose.

To fix this vulnerability, the `creator` should be set in the constructor of the contract and not be accessible or modifiable by any other function. Additionally, the `migrateTo` function should be restricted to only the `creator` or a designated admin address.",938,187,8.05746841430664
21,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the access control issue present in the `sendTo` function of the `MyContract` contract. The vulnerability lies in line 20: `require(tx.origin == owner);`. This line uses `tx.origin` to check if the caller of the function is the owner of the contract. However, `tx.origin` is considered deprecated and unreliable for access control in Solidity, as it can be easily spoofed by malicious actors.

A better approach to access control would be to use a modifier that checks if the caller is the owner, like this:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.2EE;

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `refund` function, which uses `msg.sender.transfer(balances[msg.sender]);` to send the balance back to the caller. This can be exploited by an attacker who is not the intended recipient of the refund.

In Solidity, `msg.sender` is the address that is currently calling the contract. In the context of the `refund` function, `msg.sender` is the address that initiated the refund transaction. However, this does not necessarily mean that the address is authorized to receive the refund. An attacker could call the `refund` function from an unauthorized address and receive the funds intended for the original owner.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should implement proper access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized addresses can call the `refund` function. This can be achieved by using a modifier that checks if the caller is authorized or by implementing a role-based access control system.",970,235,10.212612390518188
23,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, which inherits from the `BaseToken` contract. The constructor of `CustomToken` assigns the entire token supply to a single address (0x873c50dcac16d9db1b67d7c6ff596f69981c4c71) and then immediately transfers all the tokens to the same address. This means that the single address has full control over the token supply, and if this address is compromised or malicious, it could lead to the loss of all tokens.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` contract does not have any access control mechanisms in place to restrict who can call the `CustomToken` constructor or interact with the contract's functions.

The vulnerability lies in the `changeOwner` function in the `Unprotected` contract. This function allows anyone to change the owner of the contract by calling it with the new owner's address as an argument. Since the `changeOwner` function is public and does not have any access control checks, it can be exploited by any user to change the ownership of the contract.

This can lead to various issues, such as unauthorized access to sensitive data, manipulation of contract logic, or even theft of funds if the contract holds any. To fix this vulnerability, the `changeOwner` function should be modified to include access control checks, ensuring that only the current owner or a designated authority can change the ownership of the contract.",707,170,7.282903432846069

The vulnerability lies in the `IntegerOverflowMul` contract, specifically in the `run` function at line 17: `count *= input;`. This line of code is susceptible to integer overflow because it multiplies the `count` variable by the `input` without any checks for overflow.

In Solidity, when an integer overflow occurs, the result wraps around to the minimum value of the data type. This can lead to unexpected and potentially harmful behavior in smart contracts. For example, if the `count` variable reaches a value that, when multiplied by `input`, causes an overflow, the resulting value will be incorrect and could be exploited by an attacker.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library, which provides functions for safe arithmetic operations, or you can manually add overflow checks to the code.",553,201,8.492478132247925

In Solidity, the `uint` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When an overflow occurs, the result wraps around to zero. In this case, if `_secondsToIncrease` is large enough, the `lockTime` value could wrap around to zero, effectively resetting the lock time to zero and allowing the user to withdraw their funds immediately.",859,143,6.195937395095825

In Solidity, the `mapping` data structure is initialized with a default value of 0 for all keys. When assigning a value to a key that has not been accessed before, the assignment operation is equivalent to adding the value to the current value of the key. In this case, the key `0x873c50dcac1sin6d9db1b67d7c6ff596f69981c4c71` has not been accessed before, so the assignment operation is equivalent to adding `totalSupply` to the current value of the key, which is 0.

However, the `totalSupply` value is very large (5000000000000000000000000000), and adding it to 0 may cause an integer overflow, resulting in an incorrect balance value for the address `0x8",561,301,12.874033689498901
85,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the `CustomToken()` constructor function. The issue is that the `totalSupply` is set to a very large number (5000000000000000000000000000), and then the entire supply is transferred to the address `0x873c50dcac16d9db1b67d7c6ff596f69981c4c71`.

The problem arises when the `balanceOf` mapping is accessed with the large `totalSupply` value. Since the `balanceOf` mapping is a key-value storage, the key is hashed to a smaller size (256 bits). If the `totalSupply` is too large, it may cause an integer overflow when hashing the key, leading to an incorrect address being used in the `Transfer` event. This can result in funds being sent to an unintended address, potentially leading to loss of funds or other unintended consequences.

The vulnerability lies in the operations that perform addition, multiplication, and subtraction on the `count` variable, which is of type `uint256`. In Solidity, `uint256` is an unsigned integer type that can lead to overflow and underflow issues if not handled properly.

The vulnerable lines in the code are:

1. Line 18: `count += input;`
2. Line 24: `count *= input;`
3. Line 30: `count -= input;`

When subtracting `_value` from `balances[msg.sender]`, if the sender's balance is less than `_value`, the result will wrap around to a very large number due to the lack of overflow checks. This can lead to an incorrect balance update and potentially allow the sender to transfer more tokens than they actually have.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflow and underflow.

This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploitation.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library provided by OpenZeppelin, which includes overflow checks for arithmetic operations. Here's an example of how you can modify the `add` function to use SafeMath:

This predictability can be exploited by a malicious user who can observe the blockchain and predict the outcome of the `rand` function, thus potentially manipulating the outcome of the contract's logic that relies on this randomness.

In the provided code, the `rand` function uses the block number minus one to generate a hash value, which is then used to produce a pseudo-random number. Since miners have control over the block creation process, they can influence the block number and, consequently, the output of the `rand` function.

The `block.blockhash(block.number - 1)` function returns the hash of the previous block, which is predictable and can be known by miners or anyone with access to the blockchain. The `now` variable is also predictable as it represents the current timestamp. Combining these two predictable values and hashing them with `keccak256` does not provide a secure source of randomness.

In this line, the contract sends `_am` ether to the `msg.sender` and then checks if the call was successful. However, if the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract with a fallback function designed to reenter the contract, it can call the `Collect` function again before the balance is updated, leading to multiple withdrawals and potentially draining the contract's funds.

112,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawAll` function of the `ReentrancyDAO` contract. The issue is the same as in the first example you provided: the contract allows external calls to be made before the state of the contract is updated.

In the `withdrawAll` function, the contract sends Ether to the `msg.sender` before updating the `credit` mapping. This means that if the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract that has a fallback function designed to call back into the `withdrawAll` function, it can potentially withdraw more Ether than it should.

To fix this vulnerability, you should update the `credit` mapping before sending Ether to the `msg.sender`. Here's an updated version of the `withdrawAll` function:

```solidity
function withdrawAll() public {
    uint oCredit = credit[msg.sender];
    if (oCredit > 0) {
        credit[msg.sender] = 0;

The vulnerability lies in line 29:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. In this case, the Collect function is vulnerable to reentrancy because it allows the external contract to call the Put function before the balance is deducted.

An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the Collect function and then calls the Put function in the same transaction. This would result in the attacker being able to withdraw more funds than they should be able to, as the balance would not have been deducted yet.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern, where all checks and effects are performed before any external interactions. In this case, the balance should be deducted before calling the external contract.

Here's an example of how the Collect function can be modified to prevent the reentrancy attack:

At this point, the caller's code is executed, and it can call the `transfer` function, which modifies the state of the contract. This allows for a reentrancy attack, where an attacker can call the `withdrawBalance` function repeatedly before the initial execution is complete, draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests that you should first perform all checks and effects (state changes) before interacting with external contracts. In this case, you should set the user's balance to zero before making the external call:

2. Line 20: `pastBlockTime = now;`

These lines ensure that only one transaction can be executed per block by comparing the current time (`now`) with the `pastBlockTime`. However, miners have the ability to manipulate the timestamp of a block within a certain range, which can be exploited to bypass this check and execute multiple transactions within a single block.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who can mine a block with a manipulated timestamp, allowing them to execute the `()[msg.value == 10 ether]` function multiple times within a single block.

132,short addresses," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to short address attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `sendCoin` function handles the `to` address parameter. In Solidity, addresses are 20 bytes long, but when passed as arguments to functions, they can be padded with zeros. If an attacker uses a short address (less than 20 bytes), the contract might interpret it as a different address, leading to funds being sent to an unintended recipient.

To fix this issue, the `sendCoin` function should explicitly check the length of the `to` address and reject any short addresses. Here's an updated version of the `sendCoin` function:

```solidity
function sendCoin(address to, uint amount) returns(bool sufficient) {

    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[to] += amount;
    Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. An attacker can repeatedly call the `addCreditors` function to fill the `creditorAddresses` array until it reaches a length of 1500. Once this threshold is reached, the `emptyCreditors` function will be triggered, which clears the entire `creditorAddresses` array. This can be done repeatedly, causing the contract to be unable to process legitimate transactions involving the `creditorAddresses` array, effectively denying service to legitimate users.",929,134,6.008162260055542
134,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles the dynamic array `array`. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the array is being resized:

Line 18-22:
```
for(uint i=0;i<numbers;i++) {
    if(numElements == array.length) {
        array.length += 1;
    }
    array[numElements++] = value;
}
```

The issue here is that Solidity does not allow resizing an array by directly modifying its length property. The line `array.length += 1;` is not valid Solidity code and will result in a compilation error.

However, the intention behind this line is to resize the array when it reaches its current length. The correct way to resize an array in Solidity is by using the `push` method, which automatically resizes the array and adds the element to the end.

To fix this vulnerability, the `insertNnumbers` function should be updated to use the `push` method:

```
function insertNnumbers(uint value, uint numbers) public {
    for(uint i=0; i<numbers; i++) {
        array.push(value);

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the reset of the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays in the `lendGovernmentMoney` function. This reset occurs every time a new credit cycle starts, which is defined by the condition `lastTimeOfNewCredit + TWELVE_HOURS < block.timestamp`. When the arrays are reset, all the previously stored creditor addresses and amounts are lost, which can be exploited by repeatedly calling the `lendGovernmentMoney` function to prevent the system from functioning correctly.

An attacker can call the `lendGovernmentMoney` function with a small amount of Ether, triggering the reset of the arrays and effectively halting the system from processing any further transactions. This can lead to a denial of service, as the contract will not be able to process any new transactions until the next credit cycle starts.

To fix this vulnerability, the reset of the arrays should be removed or handled in a more controlled manner, ensuring that the system can continue to function even after a new credit cycle starts.",2480,255,11.836046695709229

If any of the addresses in the array is a contract that has a fallback function that consumes a significant amount of gas or gets stuck in an infinite loop, the transaction will fail, and the entire `refundAll` function will revert. This will result in a denial of service, as the funds will be stuck in the contract and cannot be refunded.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` contract inherits from the `BaseToken` contract, which has a `Transfer` event.
