11,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function in the `MultiOwnable` contract. The function allows any user to become an owner by calling it, without any proper authorization checks. This means that any user can become an owner and gain control over the contract's functions that are restricted to owners only.

The `newOwner` function should be modified to include proper authorization checks, ensuring that only the root owner or the current owner can add new owners. This can be achieved by adding an `onlyOwner` modifier to the `newOwner` function, similar to the `deleteOwner` function.

Here's an updated version of the `MultiOwnable` contract with the `newOwner` function modified to include the `onlyOwner` modifier:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0right(0.4.23);

contract MultiOwnable {
  address public root;
  mapping (address => address) public owners;  

   
  constructor() public {
    root = msg.sender;

12,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `msg.sender` in the `missing()` function to set the `owner` address. This allows any user to call the `missing()` function and become the owner of the contract, bypassing the intended access control mechanism.",765,63,2.738485813140869
13,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `addPayout` function, where the `creator` address is not checked before sending funds to the `Participant` addresses. This means that any user can call the `addPayout` function and send funds to the `Participant` addresses, potentially draining the contract's balance.

To fix this vulnerability, the `addPayout` function should be modified to include a modifier that checks if the caller is the `creator` before allowing the function to execute. This can be done by adding a `onlyOwner` modifier similar to the one used in the `changeOwner` function.

Here's an example of how the `addPayout` function can be modified to include the `onlyOwner` modifier:

```solidity
modifier onlyOwner {
    require(msg.sender == creator);
    _;
}

function addPayout(uint _fee) onlyOwner private {
    //... existing code
}
```

By adding this modification, the `addPayout` function will only be accessible by the `creator` address, preventing unauthorized users from draining the contract's balance.",3426,279,12.609073638916016
14,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);
```

This line checks if the requested withdrawal amount is greater than or equal to the balance of the sender. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent unauthorized access to the contract's funds. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a contract that calls the `withdraw` function with a specific address and amount, effectively stealing funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should implement a proper access control mechanism, such as using a modifier to restrict access to the `withdraw` function only to authorized addresses.",967,175,7.329746961593628
15,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being updated with the `totalSupply` before the constructor has finished executing. This can lead to a situation where the `balanceOf` mapping is accessible and modifiable by other contracts or functions before the contract is fully initialized, potentially leading to an attack where the balance can be manipulated.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` contract inherits from the `BaseToken` contract, which contains a `mapping (address => uint256) public balanceOf;` mapping. This mapping is not explicitly initialized in the `CustomToken` constructor, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

To fix this issue, you should ensure that the `balanceOf` mapping is properly initialized and that the contract's state is fully set up before allowing any external interactions.",782,209,8.700208902359009
16,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `set` function of the `Map` contract, which allows anyone to modify the `map` array by calling the function with any `key` and `value`. This means that the contract does not properly restrict who can modify the `map` data, potentially leading to unauthorized changes.",867,85,3.6592838764190674
17,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of delegatecall in the Proxy contract. The vulnerability lies in the Proxy contract's forward function, which uses delegatecall to call the callee contract with the provided data.

Delegatecall allows a contract to execute the code of another contract in the context of the calling contract. This means that the callee contract can access the storage, variables, and functions of the calling contract. If an attacker can control the callee contract, they can potentially access sensitive data or execute malicious code in the context of the Proxy contract.

In this case, the Proxy contract does not have any access control mechanism to ensure that only trusted contracts can be called through delegatecall. This makes it vulnerable to attacks where an attacker can deploy a malicious contract and use the Proxy contract to execute its code, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data or funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the Proxy contract should implement access control mechanisms to ensure that only trusted contracts can be called through delegatecall. This can be done by maintaining a list of allowed contracts and checking if the callee contract is in the list before executing the delegatecall.",719,264,10.880796194076538

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the access control issue in the `PopBonusCode` function. The condition `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length);` is always true since array lengths are unsigned and cannot be negative.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. Although it is not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, the mention of `tx.origin` in the explanation suggests that it might be used elsewhere in the contract or in the context of the application interacting with the contract.

The `tx.origin` is a global variable in Solidity that represents the original transaction sender, which is the account that initiated the transaction. However, it is deprecated and not recommended for use in smart contracts because it can be easily bypassed by attackers.

For example, if an attacker uses a contract that calls the vulnerable contract, the `tx.origin` will be the attacker's account, not the original transaction sender. This can lead to unautrighted access to the contract's functionality and potentially result in unauthorized actions, such as transferring funds or manipulating data.

To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a more secure approach for access control, such as using a whitelist of authorized addresses or implementing a more robust access control mechanism that does not rely on `tx.origin`.",768,258,10.664646625518799
20,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `msg.sender` in the `initWallet` function without proper access control. This allows any user to set the `creator` address, which is then used as a guard in the `migrateTo` function to prevent the creator from transferring the contract's balance to another address. If an attacker can set the `creator` to their own address, they can bypass this restriction and transfer the contract's funds.",994,111,4.739039182662964

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `refund` function, which uses `msg.sender.transfer(balances[msg.sender]);` to send the balance back to the caller. This can be exploited by an attacker who calls the `refund` function, as it does not properly check if the caller is authorized to withdraw the funds. This could lead to unauthorized transfers of funds from the contract.",1026,108,4.639515161514282
23,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The contract is assigning the entire token supply to a single address (0x57cad6a4c83286406fd0fc9218931b3b83853e65) during deployment. This means that only the deployer of the contract has control over the entire token supply, which is a significant access control issue.

This can lead to various problems, such as the deployer being able to manipulate the token supply, or other contracts or users being unable to interact with the contract in a fair and decentralized manner. Additionally, if the deployer's address is compromised, the entire token supply could be at risk.",659,185,7.664817571640015
24,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the access control issue in the `changeOwner` function. The function allows anyone to change the owner of the contract by simply calling it with a new address.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in both the `withdraw` function and the fallback function. The `delegatecall` allows the contract to execute code in the context of another contract, which can lead to unintended behavior if the caller is not properly controlled. In this case, the `withdraw` function and the fallback function are allowing any caller to execute the `setFibonacci` function of the `FibonacciLib` contract, which can lead to unautrightful manipulation of the `calculatedFibNumber` value. This can be exploited by an attacker to drain funds from the contract by setting the `calculatedFibNumber` to a high value before calling the `withdraw` function.",1354,170,7.226315259933472

The vulnerability lies in the same lines as the original code you provided:

1. Line 54: owner2.send(sum2);
2. Line 65: owner.send(balance);

In both cases, the contract is using the low-level send function without checking its return value. If the transaction fails for any reason (e.g., insufficient gas, the recipient's address is incorrect, or the recipient's account is not funded), the function will return false, but the contract will continue to execute. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the transfer function instead of send, which checks for errors and reverts the transaction if any issues are encountered. Here's an example of how to modify the tokens_buy function:

The issue is that the return value of this function is not checked, which means that if the call fails, the contract will continue to execute without reverting the transaction. This can lead to fail-open situations and other unwanted outcomes.

To fix this vulnerability, the return value of the `call.value` function should be checked, and the transaction should be reverted if the call fails. Here's an example of how to fix the `sendMoney` function:

This can lead to front-running attacks where a malicious user can exploit the information about the upcoming transaction and execute their own transaction with a higher gas fee, effectively stealing the intended transaction's value.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a secure method to approve the value, such as using a commit-reveal scheme or a secure random number generator to generate a nonce that is used in the approval process.

The vulnerability lies in the way the `play` function processes transactions.

In the context of this contract, a malicious user could see a pending transaction where a player is submitting a number to the `play` function. The malicious user could then submit their own transaction with a higher gas fee, causing their transaction to be processed first. This would allow them to potentially win the game before the original transaction is processed, leading to a front running attack.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract could be modified to use an internal queue to process transactions in the order they are received, rather than relying on the order in which they are mined.

The vulnerability lies in the `IntegerOverflowMul` contract, specifically in the `run` function at line 17: `count *= input;`. This line of code is susceptible to integer overflow because it multiplies the `count` variable by the `input` without any checks for overflow.

In Solidity, when an integer overflow occurs, the result wraps around to the minimum value of the type. For example, if `count` is `2**256 - 1` and `input` is `2`, the result of the multiplication would be `0` instead of the expected `2**256`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially be exploited by attackers.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflow and underflow. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath to fix the vulnerability:

The line `balanceOf[0x57cad6a4c83286406fd0fc9218931b3b83853e65] = totalSupply;` assigns the `totalSupply` to the balance of the first account. However, the `totalSupply` is set to a very large number, which can cause an integer overflow when subtracted from or added to other numbers.

In the `BaseToken` contract, the `balanceOf` mapping is defined as `mapping (address => uint256)`, which means that the balance is stored as an unsigned integer (uint256). When performing arithmetic operations on unsigned integers, an integer overflow can occur if the result exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the data type.

In this case, if the `totalSupply` is subtracted from or added to another number, and the result exceeds the maximum value of uint256 (2^256 - 1), an integer overflow will occur. This can lead to incorrect balances and potentially allow attackers to manipulate the contract's state, leading to theft or denial of service.

In this case, if `_secondsToIncrease` is large enough, the `lockTime` value could wrap around to zero, effectively resetting the lock time to zero and allowing the user to withdraw their funds immediately.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who sends a large `_secondsToIncrease` value to the `increaseLockTime` function, causing the `lockTime` value to overflow and reset to zero.

The vulnerability lies in the `run` function of the `IntegerOverflowMultiTxMultiFuncFeasible` contract. The line `count -= input;` can cause an underflow if the `input` is greater than the current value of `count`. In Solidity version 0.4.23, there is no built-in overflow or underflow checking, which means that if `count` becomes negative due to the subtraction, it will wrap around to a very large positive number, leading to incorrect behavior and potential exploitation.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library, which provides arithmetic operations with overflow and underflow checks. Here's an updated version of the contract using SafeMath:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.23;

84,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the `CustomToken()` constructor function. The line `balanceOf[0x57cad6a4c83286406fd0fc9218931b3b83853e65] = totalSupply;` is vulnerable to integer overflow.

In Solidity, when assigning a value to a mapping, the value is implicitly converted to the key type. In this case, the `balanceOf` mapping has a `uint256` type, and the `totalSupply` is also a `uint256`. When assigning the `totalSupply` to the `balanceOf` mapping, the value is implicitly converted to a `uint256`.

However, the `totalSupply` is initialized with a value of `10000000000000000000000000000`, which is a very large number. When this value is assigned to the `balanceOf` mapping, it may cause an integer overflow, as the maximum value of a `uint25EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE",617,301,12.33388376235962
85,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the `CustomToken()` constructor function. The issue is with the following line:

```solidity
balanceOf[0x57cad6a4c83286406fd0fc9218931b3b83853e65] = totalSupply;
```

Here, the `balanceOf` mapping is being set to the `totalSupply` value, which is a very large number (100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000). If the `balanceOf` mapping is not initialized to handle such a large value, it could lead to an integer overflow when trying to store this value.

Additionally, the `Transfer` event is emitted with the `totalSupply` value, which could also cause an integer overflow if the event parameters are not properly handled.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `balanceOf` mapping and event parameters can handle large values without causing an integer overflow.",698,270,11.127061605453491

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. This is because it uses Solidity version 0.4.23, which does not have built-in overflow checks. The operations in the functions `overflowaddtostate`, `overflowmultostate`, `underflowtostate`, `overflowlocalonly`, `overflowmulocalonly`, and `underflowlocalonly` can lead to integer overflow and underflow issues.",1034,97,4.19432520866394
87,arithmetic," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the same type of arithmetic overflow issue as the first contract. The vulnerability lies in the `transfer` function, specifically in the lines:

```solidity
require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
```

In Solidity version 0.4.18, the `uint` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When subtracting `_value` from `balances[msg.sender]`, if the result is less than zero, it will wrap around to a very large positive number due to the nature of unsigned integer arithmetic. This can lead to an incorrect balance update and potentially allow the attacker to drain funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations, or upgrade to a newer Solidity version (0.8.x or above) that includes built-in overflow checks.",876,226,9.40277624130249

The vulnerability lies in the `add` function of the `Overflow` contract. When the `value` being added to `sellerBalance` is large enough, it can cause an overflow, which means the result will wrap around and become a smaller number than expected. This can lead to incorrect balances and potentially allow for exploits where an attacker can manipulate the contract's state.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin or similar libraries that provide safe arithmetic operations. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath to fix the vulnerability:

90,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the line:

```solidity
balanceOf[_to] += _value;
```

In Solidity, the `+=` operator can cause an integer overflow if the result of the addition is greater than the maximum value that can be stored in a `uint256` (which is 2^256 - 1). When an overflow occurs, the result wraps around to 0, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploits.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library provided by OpenZeppelin, which includes overflow-safe arithmetic operations. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath in the contract:

95,bad randomness," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of bad randomness in the `GuessTheRandomNumberChallenge` contract. The vulnerability lies in the way the `answer` variable is generated in the constructor of the contract.

The line `answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));` uses the `block.blockhash(block.number - 1)` and `now` as inputs to the `keccak256` hash function to generate the `answer`. However, both of these values are predictable and can be influenced by miners.

The `block.blockhash(block.number - 1)` is predictable because it is the hash of the previous block, which is publicly available and can be easily obtained. The `now` variable is also predictable because it represents the current timestamp, which can be easily obtained by any user.

As a result, a malicious user can predict the `answer` value and exploit the `guess` function to win the challenge. This vulnerability can be mitigated by using a more secure source of randomness, such as the Ethereum blockchain's commit-reveal scheme or an off-chain random number generation service.",873,281,11.603716135025024

The vulnerability lies in line 29:

```solidity

This line allows the `msg.sender` to make a recursive call to the `Collect` function before the balance update is completed. If the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract with a fallback function designed to drain funds, it can repeatedly call the `Collect` function, potentially draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you should follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern, which means updating the contract's state (effects) before interacting with external contracts (interactions). In this case, you should deduct the `_am` amount from the `acc.balance` before making the external call. Here's an updated version of the `Collect` function:

The vulnerability lies in line 29:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (in this case, the `msg.sender`) and sending Ether to it before updating the balance of the `acc` account. This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `Collect` function before the balance update is completed, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the balance update should be done before the external call, and the contract should use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. Here's an example of how the `Collect` function can be modified to avoid the reentrancy attack:

```solidity
function Collect(uint _am)
    public

}
```

This line allows the `msg.sender` to call the `withdrawBalance` function again before the balance is updated to 0. This can lead to multiple withdrawal calls being made in a single transaction, potentially draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you can update the `withdrawBalance` function to follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern, which means updating the state (userBalance) before interacting with external contracts:

```solidity
function withdrawBalance() {
    userBalance[msg.sender] = 0;
    if(! (msg.sender.call.value(userBalance[msg.sender])() ) ){

In this line, the contract is sending Ether to the `msg.sender` before updating the balance. If the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract with a fallback function that calls back into the `CashOut` function, it can withdraw more Ether than it should, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance before sending Ether to the `msg.sender`. Here's an updated version of the `CashOut` function:

123,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 29:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. In this case, the Collect function is vulnerable to reentrancy because it allows the external contract to call the Put function before the balance is deducted.

An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the Collect function and then calls the Put function before the balance is deducted. This would result in the attacker being able to withdraw more funds than they are entitled to.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, where all checks and effects are performed before any external interactions. In this case, the balance should be deducted before calling the external contract.

126,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract. The issue is that the contract allows external calls to be made before the state of the contract is updated. In this case, the `userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;` line is executed after the external call, which means that if the external call is a reentrant call, it can withdraw the balance again before the balance is set to zero.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the state before making any external calls. Here's an example of a secure implementation:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract SecureReentrancy {

    mapping (address => uint) private userBalances;

    function withdrawBalance() public {
        uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];

In this secure implementation, the `userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;` line is executed before the external call,",801,301,12.360419511795044
127,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `isSaleFinished()` function of the `TimedCrowdsale` contract, which relies on the `block.timestamp` to determine if the sale is finished.

128,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation due to the reliance on block.timestamp for both the payOut function and the randomGen function. This can be exploited by miners to manipulate the reported time, affecting the contract's behavior.",961,59,2.63210391998291
129,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the resetInvestment function, specifically in the line:

if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp+ONE_MINUTE)

This condition checks if the current block timestamp is at least one minute after the last investment timestamp. However, as mentioned in the provided explanation, miners have leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred. This means that an attacker could potentially manipulate the block timestamp to bypass the one-minute restriction and call the resetInvestment function prematurely.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should not rely solely on block.timestamp for time-sensitive operations. Instead, it could use a more reliable time source or implement a time lock mechanism that doesn't rely on block timestamps.",1241,186,7.836078643798828
130,time manipulation," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the logic that checks if the current time (`now`) is not equal to the `pastBlockTime` and then updates `pastBlockTime` to the current time. This logic is intended to ensure that only one transaction per block can execute the `if(now % 15 == 0)` condition. However, miners have control over the timestamp they report for a block, and they can manipulate this value within a certain range (up to 15 minutes in the past or future).

An attacker could exploit this by creating a transaction with a timestamp that is a multiple of 15 minutes ahead of the `pastBlockTime`. This would allow the attacker to bypass the `require(now!= pastBlockTime)` check and execute the `if(now % 15 == 0)` condition, potentially draining funds from the contract.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should not rely solely on the block timestamp for critical logic. Instead, it could use a more robust method for determining eligibility for the transfer, such as using an oracle or a time-lock mechanism that does not depend on the block timestamp.",813,267,11.061456203460693
131,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same line as the first contract:

This line uses block.timestamp to generate a random number, which can be manipulated by miners. An attacker with enough hash power could influence the block timestamp to control the outcome of the random number generation, potentially winning the lottery multiple times or avoiding paying fees.",1027,107,4.594966173171997
132,short addresses," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to short address attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `sendCoin` function handles the `to` address. The `to` address is passed as a parameter without type checking or validation, which means an attacker could pass a short address (a 20-byte address instead of the full 20-byte address) to the function. If the contract interacts with other contracts or libraries that do not properly validate the length of the address, it could lead to unintended behavior or loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `sendCoin` function should validate the length of the `to` address before proceeding with the transaction. Here's an updated version of the `sendCoin` function:

```solidity
function sendCoin(address to, uint amount) returns(bool sufficient) {
    if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) return false;
    if (to.length!= 20) return false;
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[to] += amount;
    Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
    return true;
}

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. An attacker can repeatedly call the `addCreditors` function to fill the `creditorAddresses` array until it reaches a size of 1500. Once this happens, the `emptyCreditors` function will be triggered, which clears the `creditorAddresses` array and sets the `win` variable to true.

134,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the contract attempts to dynamically resize the `array` if `numElements` is equal to `array.length`.

In Solidity, arrays are fixed-size data structures, and their size cannot be changed after they are initialized. The line `array.length += 1;` is attempting to change the size of the array, which is not allowed and will result in a runtime error. This error will cause the transaction to revert, effectively denying service to the user who called the `insertNnumbers` function.

To fix this vulnerability, you should initialize the array with a fixed size that is sufficient to hold the maximum number of elements you expect to store in it. Alternatively, you can use a dynamic array like `uint[]` without specifying the size, which will allow the array to grow as needed. However, keep in mind that resizing a dynamic array can be expensive in terms of gas costs.",1112,230,9.618067264556885

```

This line attempts to send Ether to each address in the `refundAddresses` array. If any of the `send` operations fail, the entire `refundAll` function will fail and roll back all previous transactions, effectively holding up all funds. This can be exploited by an attacker who can control one of the addresses in the `refundAddresses` array, causing the `send` operation to fail and denying service to the contract.",1012,166,6.984354734420776
