11,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function of the `MultiOwnable` contract.

The issue is that the `newOwner` function allows any user to become an owner of the contract by calling the function and passing their address as the `_owner` parameter. This means that any user can become an owner, which can lead to unautrightful access control.

The `newOwner` function should only allow the root owner or the current owner to add new owners. This can be achieved by adding an additional check in the `newOwner` function to ensure that the caller is either the root owner or the current owner.

Here's an updated version of the `MultiOwnable` contract with the fix:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.23;

contract MultiOwnable {
  address public root;
  mapping (address => address) public owners;

  constructor() public {
    root = msg.sender;
    owners[root] = root;
  }

  modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(owners[msg.sender]!= 0);

12,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `balanceChecker` contract's `checkBals` function. The issue is that the `ERC20` contract address is passed as a parameter to the `checkBals` function, which can be manipulated by an attacker. This allows the attacker to potentially call the `balanceOf` function on any ERC20 token contract, leading to access control issues.

An attacker can create a malicious ERC20 token contract with a fallback function that calls the `balanceChecker`'s `checkBals` function with the `Missing` contract's address as an argument. This would allow the attacker to call the `balanceOf` function on the `Missing` contract, bypassing the access control implemented in the `onlyowner` modifier.

To fix this vulnerability, the `balanceChecker` contract should not accept arbitrary ERC20 contract addresses as parameters. Instead, it should only work with a specific ERC20 token contract that is known and trusted.",623,244,10.0915687084198
13,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues.

The vulnerability lies in the `addPayout` function, where the `creator` address is not checked before sending Ether to the `etherAddress` of the participant. This means that any user can call the `addPayout` function and send Ether to their own address, effectively stealing funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `addPayout` function should be modified to include a check that ensures the `msg.sender` is the same as the `creator` address before sending Ether. This can be done by adding a modifier like `onlycreator` and using it in the `addPayout` function.

Here's an example of how the `addPayout` function can be modified to include the `onlycreator` modifier:

```solidity
modifier onlycreator {
    require(msg.sender == creator, ""Caller is not the creator"");
    _;
}

function addPayout(uint _fee) public onlycreator {
    //... existing code
}
```

By adding this modification, the contract will only allow the `creator` to call the `addPayout` function, preventing unautrighted users from stealing funds.",3284,294,13.234769105911255
14,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function, specifically in the line `require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);`. This line checks if the requested withdrawal amount is greater than or equal to the balance of the sender. However, this check is unnecessary and can lead to a vulnerability known as a reentrancy attack.

In a reentrancy attack, an attacker can call the `withdraw` function and then call another function in the contract before the state is updated. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially allow the attacker to drain funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `require` statement should be removed, and the `withdraw` function should be refactored to update the sender's balance before sending the funds. Here's an updated version of the `withdraw` function:

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
    uint256 senderBalance = balances[msg.sender];
    require(senderBalance >= amount, ""Insufficient balance"");
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;

15,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `balanceChecker` contract, specifically in the `checkBals` function. The issue is that the `ERC20` contract address is passed as a parameter to the `checkBals` function, but there is no access control mechanism in place to ensure that only authorized users can call this function. This means that any user can call the `checkBals` function and retrieve the balances of the addresses passed as a parameter.

This can lead to a privacy breach, as the balances of ERC20 tokens held by the addresses can be exposed to unauthorized users. To fix this vulnerability, an access control mechanism should be implemented in the `checkBals` function to ensure that only authorized users can call it.",640,181,7.531551122665405

17,access control," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of delegatecall in the Proxy contract. The vulnerability lies in the fact that delegatecall allows the callee contract to execute in the context of the proxy contract, which means it can modify the state of the proxy contract. If an attacker can control the callee contract, they could potentially exploit this to manipulate the state of the proxy contract or even the contracts that the proxy contract interacts with.

In the given code, the Proxy contract uses delegatecall to forward calls to the callee contract. This can be dangerous if the callee contract is not trusted or if it has not been properly audited for security vulnerabilities. An attacker could create a malicious contract that, when called through the Proxy contract, could perform unautrightful actions or access sensitive data.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use call instead of delegatecall when forwarding calls to other contracts. Additionally, it is crucial to ensure that the callee contracts are trusted and have been thoroughly audited for security vulnerabilities before using them with a proxy contract.",577,244,10.102661609649658

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` to validate callers, which can lead to access control bypasses. However, in the given code snippet, there is no direct evidence of `tx.origin` being used. The vulnerability mentioned in the initial code review (line 27) is not present in the provided code snippet.

But, the code still has an access control issue. The `PushBonusCode` function is marked as `public`, which means it can be called by any external account. This allows any user to add bonus codes to the `bonusCodes` array, which should ideally be restricted to the owner or a specific role.

To fix this issue, you can change the visibility of the `PushBonusEE` function to `internal` or `private` and add a role-based access control mechanism to restrict who can add bonus codes.",859,203,8.48151445388794
19,access control," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `balanceChecker` contract, specifically in the `checkBals` function.

The `checkBals` function allows any caller to access the balances of addresses in the `_location` ERC20 token. Since the `checkBals` function does not have any access control checks, an attacker can call this function and obtain the balances of other addresses. This can lead to privacy issues and potentially be used for further attacks.

To fix this vulnerability, the `checkBals` function should have access control checks to ensure that only authorized users can access the balances.",626,150,6.2517945766448975
20,access control," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `migrateTo` function, which allows the `creator` to transfer the contract's balance to any address. Since the `creator` is set in the `initWallet` function and is not protected, any user who calls `initWallet` can set themselves as the `creator`. This means they can then call `migrateTo` to transfer the contract's funds to any address they choose, effectively draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `creator` should be set in the constructor of the contract and not be modifiable by any public function. Additionally, the `migrateTo` function should be restricted to only allow the `creator` to transfer funds, or it should be removed if it's not needed.",852,191,7.98818039894104

23,access control," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable due to the presence of the `checkBals` function in the `balanceChecker` contract. This function can be exploited through an access control bypass.

The vulnerability lies in the `checkBals` function, which allows an attacker to call the `balanceOf` function of the `ERC20` contract without proper access control. The `ERC20` contract's `balanceOf` function is public and can be called by anyone. However, the `checkBals` function in the `balanceChecker` contract does not have any access control checks, allowing an attacker to call the `balanceOf` function of the `ERC20` contract through this function.

An attacker can create an instance of the `balanceChecker` contract and call the `checkBals` function with the `ERC20` contract address and an array of addresses as arguments. This will return the balances of the specified addresses in the `ERC2EE` contract. Since the `ERC20` contract's `balanceOf` function is public, the attacker can access the balances of the specified addresses without proper authorization.

The vulnerability lies in the same line as the previous example, line 44:

```solidity

This line is using the low-level `call` function without checking the return value. If the call fails, the function will continue to execute, potentially leading to fail-open behavior and other unwanted outcomes.

The vulnerability lies in the lines where the contract sends Ether to the addresses `owner2` and `owner`. These lines are:

Line 54: `owner2.send(sum2);`
Line 65: `owner.send(balance);`

The issue with these lines is that they do not check the return value of the `send()` function. The `send()` function in Solidity returns a boolean value indicating whether the transaction was successful or not. If the transaction fails, the function returns `false`.

In the given code, if the transaction fails, the contract will continue to execute the remaining code without reverting the current execution. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should check the return value of the `send()` function and handle the failure case appropriately. For example, the contract could revert the transaction or take other corrective actions.

Here's an updated version of the `tokens_buy()` function that checks the return value of the `send()` function:

```solidity
function tokens_buy() payable returns (bool) {
    require(active > 0);
    require(msg.value >= token_price);

The vulnerability lies in the `Command` function, specifically in line 39: `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);`. This line is using the low-level `call` function without checking its return value. If the call fails, the contract will continue to execute without reverting the entire transaction, which can lead to fail-open situations and other unwanted outcomes.

To fix this vulnerability, the return value of the `call` function should be checked, and the transaction should be reverted if the call fails. Here's an example of how to fix the vulnerability:

In each of these lines, the `send` function is used without checking its return value. If the `send` function fails, it will return `false`, but the code will continue to execute without handling the failure. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploits.

To fix this vulnerability, the developer should check the return value of the `send` function and handle the failure case appropriately. For example:

This line makes a low-level call to send Ether to the `_target` address without checking the return value of the call. If the call fails, the function will continue to execute, potentially leading to fail-open scenarios and other unwanted outcomes.

To fix this vulnerability, the return value of the low-level call should be checked, and appropriate error handling should be implemented.",760,144,6.04146933555603
72,unchecked low level calls," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable due to unchecked low-level calls. The vulnerability lies in the `Proxy` contract's `proxy` function, specifically in line 14:

```solidity

```

This line makes a low-level call to the `target` contract, which can potentially lead to a failure without reverting the entire transaction. The `target.call.value(msg.value)(data)` line does not check the return value of the call, which can result in a fail-open situation where the transaction continues even if the call fails. This can lead to unexpected outcomes and potential exploitation by malicious actors.

To fix this vulnerability, the return value of the low-level call should be checked, and the transaction should be reverted if the call fails. Here's an updated version of the `proxy` function:

```solidity
function proxy(address target, bytes data) public payable {
    (bool success, ) = target.call{value: msg.value}(data);

The vulnerability lies in the `claimReward` function, specifically in line 31: `msg.sender.transfer(reward);`. This line allows any user to claim the reward by transferring the reward amount to their address. Since the Ethereum blockchain is public, other users can see this transaction and potentially front-run it by sending a transaction with higher gas fees to claim the reward before the original transaction is mined.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should implement a mechanism to prevent front running, such as using a commit-reveal scheme or a secret random number to ensure that the reward is claimed by the intended user and not by a front-runner.",793,168,7.038724184036255

The vulnerability lies in the `solve` function of the `FindThisHash` contract. When a user submits a solution to the puzzle, the contract checks if the hash of the solution matches the predefined constant hash. If it does, the user is rewarded with 1000 ether. However, since the Ethereum blockchain is public, other users can see the transaction and its contents. A malicious user can then submit a transaction with a higher gas fee to solve the puzzle first and steal the reward.

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to front-running due to the public visibility of pending transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. This allows malicious users to observe and potentially exploit the order of transactions, especially in the context of the `approve` function where a user specifies a value to be transferred to a spender. If a malicious user sees a pending `approve` transaction with a high value, they could quickly submit their own transaction with a higher gas fee to be mined first, effectively stealing the intended approval value.",2204,119,5.543855905532837
76,front running," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to front running. The vulnerability lies in the combination of the publicly visible state variable `players` and the `play` function that allows users to submit their number and pay 1 ether to play the game. Since the `players` array is public, anyone can see the current state of the game, including the addresses and numbers of the players who have already played.

A malicious user can observe the state of the game and submit their transaction with a higher gas price to be mined first, effectively stealing the prize from the original player. This is because the `andTheWinnerIs` function is called when `tot` is equal to 2, meaning that the game is over and the winner is determined. If a malicious user sees that the game is about to end and they have a higher chance of winning, they can submit their transaction with a higher gas price to be mined first, thus stealing the prize from the original player.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should not make the `players` array public, or the `andTheWinnerIs` function should be called immediately after a player submits their number and payment, without waiting for the game to end.",1041,265,11.060495615005493

78,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `checkBals` function of the `balanceChecker` contract. The function retrieves the balance of an array of addresses from an ERC20 token contract. If the balance of an address is very large and the array index is incremented, it could potentially cause an integer overflow when accessing the array element.

In Solidity, the `uint` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When an integer overflow occurs, the value wraps around to zero. In the context of this contract, if an integer overflow occurs when accessing the `bals` array, it could lead to incorrect balance values being returned. This could be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the contract's behavior or cause denial of service.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflows and underflows. Here's an example of how you can modify the `checkBals` function to use SafeMath:

The issue is that the `balanceOf` function of the `ERC20` contract returns a `uint` type, which is an unsigned integer. When subtracting from an unsigned integer, if the result is negative, it will wrap around to a very large positive number due to the nature of unsigned integer arithmetic.

In the `checkBals` function, if the balance of an address is zero or negative (which is not possible in a well-implemented ERC20 contract), subtracting it from the `bals` array will cause an integer underflow, leading to an incorrect balance value. This can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate balances or cause unexpected behavior in the contract.

In Solidity, the `balanceOf` function returns a `uint256` type, which is an unsigned integer. If the balance of an address is very large, subtracting a non-zero value from it could cause an integer underflow, leading to an incorrect balance value.

For example, if the balance of an address is `2**256 - 1` (the maximum value of a `uint256`), and we subtract `1` from it, the result will be `0` instead of the expected `2**256 - 2`. This can lead to incorrect balances being returned and potentially being exploited by attackers.

106,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 55:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the `msg.sender` to make a recursive call to the `Collect` function before the initial execution is complete. If the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract, it can exploit this vulnerability by calling an external function that drains funds from the contract before the `Collect` function finishes executing.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests that you should first perform all checks and effects (state changes) before interacting with external contracts. In this case, you should deduct the `_am` amount from the `balances[msg.sender]` before making the external call.

Here's an updated version of the `Collect` function that fixes the reentrancy vulnerability:

132,short addresses," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to short address attacks. The vulnerability lies in the `sendCoin` function, which uses the `address` type for the `to` parameter. The `address` type in Solidity is 20 bytes, which is the same size as an Ethereum address. However, when an address is used in a transaction, it needs to be padded to 32 bytes. If the padding is not done correctly, it can lead to short address attacks.

In the provided code, the `sendCoin` function does not perform any padding on the `to` address, which makes it vulnerable to short address attacks. An attacker can exploit this by using a specially crafted address that is shorter than 20 bytes, causing the EVM to accept it as a valid address. This can lead to the transfer of funds to an unintended recipient.

To fix this issue, the `sendCoin` function should use the `address payable` type instead of `address` for the `to` parameter. The `address payable` type automatically handles the padding and ensures that the address is 32 bytes long.

- Line 22: `array[numElements++] = value;`

The issue is that Solidity does not allow direct resizing of arrays. The line `array.length += 1;` is not valid Solidity code and will result in a compilation error. However, the intention seems to be to resize the array when `numElements` reaches the current length of the array.

The correct way to resize an array in Solidity is to use the `push` method, which automatically resizes the array and adds an element to it. The vulnerability arises because the code attempts to manually resize the array, which is not allowed in Solidity.

However, if any of the `send` operations fail (due to insufficient gas, or the receiving address not being able to process the transaction), the entire `refundAll` function will fail and revert. This means that if an attacker can control or influence one of the addresses in the `refundAddresses` array, they can prevent the entire function from completing, effectively causing a Denial of Service.

Additionally, the `balanceChecker` contract is not directly related to the vulnerability in the `Refunder` contract.

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `ifillArray` function in the `DosOneFunc` contract. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function allows any user to fill the `listAddresses` array with up to 350 of their own addresses if the array's length is less than 1500. This can be exploited by an attacker to fill the array with their address, causing the contract to allocate a significant amount of storage for the array, which can lead to a denial of service by exhausting the contract's storage or causing high gas costs for other operations on the contract.",688,151,6.314018726348877
138,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `checkBals` function of the `balanceChecker` contract. The issue is that the `ERC20` contract is not explicitly defined in the code snippet, and the `balanceOf` function is called on the `_location` variable, which is of type `ERCEE20`. If the `_location` variable is not properly initialized or if the `_location` is a malicious contract that behaves maliciously when being the recipient of a transaction, it can lead to a denial of service.

For example, if the `_location` is a malicious contract that consumes a large amount of gas when the `balanceOf` function is called, it can cause the transaction to run out of gas and fail, leading to a denial of service. This can be particularly problematic if the `checkBals` function is called frequently or if it is called with a large array of addresses.

To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the `_location` variable is properly initialized and that the `ERC20` contract is correctly defined and deployed. Additionally, consider adding checks to ensure that the `_location` is a valid and trusted contract before calling the `balanceOf` function.",678,285,11.755735158920288
