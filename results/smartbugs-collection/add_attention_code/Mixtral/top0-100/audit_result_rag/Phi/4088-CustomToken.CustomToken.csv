The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function of the `MultiOwnable` contract. The function allows any user to become an owner by calling it, without any proper authorization checks. This means that any user can become an owner and gain control over the contract's functionality, which is a serious security flaw.

The `newOwner` function should only be callable by the root owner or a designated admin, but the current implementation allows any user to call it. This can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the contract's state.

To fix this vulnerability, the `newOwner` function should be restricted to only be callable by the root owner or a designated admin, and proper authorization checks should be implemented to ensure that only authorized users can call it.",1053,185,7.784273386001587

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the access control issue in the `DynamicPyramid` function. The `creator` address is set to `msg.sender` when the contract is deployed, which means any user can call the `DynamicPyramid` function and set themselves as the `creator`. This allows them to change the contract's logic and potentially exploit it.

To fix this vulnerability, the `DynamicPyramid` function should only be callable by the contract's owner or a specific role with the necessary permissions. This can be achieved by using the `onlyOwner` modifier, which checks if the `msg.sender` is the owner before executing the function.",3375,154,7.345028638839722
14,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function, specifically in line 20:

require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);

This line allows any user to withdraw their balance, but it does not prevent the user from withdrawing more than their balance. The `require` statement checks if the requested amount is greater than or equal to the user's balance, but it does not prevent the user from requesting more than their balance. This can lead to a situation where a user can drain the contract's funds by repeatedly calling the `withdraw` function with an amount greater than their balance.

To fix this vulnerability, the `require` statement should be modified to check if the requested amount is less than or equal to the user's balance:

require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);",916,195,8.14623761177063
15,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being updated with the `totalSupply` amount for the address `0xfb2555c0d788c0583b5f5a3a31744c73b0370fc6` before the `Transfer` event is emitted. This can lead to an issue where the `Transfer` event is not emitted for the initial supply transfer, which can cause problems with event tracking and logging.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` contract does not have any access control mechanisms in place, which means that any function in the contract can be called by any external account. This can lead to potential vulnerabilities if the contract is extended or modified in the future.

To fix this issue, the `Transfer` event should be emitted before updating the `balanceOf` mapping, and access control mechanisms should be implemented in the `CustomToken` contract to ensure that only authorized accounts can call its functions.",731,256,10.604710340499878

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `set` function, specifically in the line `map[key] = value;`. This function allows anyone to overwrite the values in the `map` array without any form of access control or authorization checks. An attacker could exploit this by calling the `set` function with a key that already exists in the `map` and setting it to a malicious value.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` contract inherits from the `BaseToken` contract, which has a public `balanceOf` mapping. This means that anyone can access the balance of the token for any address, which is a significant access control issue.",816,154,6.47036337852478

The vulnerability lies in the Proxy contract's forward function, which uses delegatecall to call the callee contract. This can be exploited if an attacker finds a way to control the callee contract or if the callee contract has a vulnerability that can be triggered by the delegatecall.

In this case, the CustomToken contract is a potential target for such an attack. If an attacker can deploy a malicious contract with the same address as the CustomToken contract, they can potentially exploit the delegatecall in the Proxy contract to execute malicious code or manipulate the CustomToken contract's state.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a more secure proxy pattern, such as the ""Proxy"" pattern from OpenZeppelin, which includes access control checks to ensure that only authorized contracts can be called through the proxy.",668,197,8.196682929992676

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the access control issue in the `PopBonusCode` function. The condition `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length);` is always true since array lengths are unsigned and cannot be negative. This means that the `PopBonusCode` function can be called without any restrictions, potentially leading to an underflow error if the bonusCodes array is empty.",950,90,3.8944036960601807
19,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function. The `CustomToken` contract inherits from the `BaseToken` contract, which defines a `mapping` for `balanceOf`. However, the `mapping` is not initialized properly in the `CustomToken` constructor.

In the `CustomToken` constructor, the `balanceOf` mapping is not initialized for all possible addresses. This can lead to an issue where the `balanceOf` mapping does not have a default value for addresses that are not explicitly set. When the `balanceOf` function is called for an address that has not been explicitly set, it will return zero, which can lead to incorrect calculations and potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the token balances.

To fix this vulnerability, the `balanceOf` mapping should be initialized for all possible addresses, or a default value should be set for addresses that are not explicitly set.",717,211,8.752281188964844

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `migrateTo` function, which allows the `creator` of the wallet to transfer the entire balance to another address. Since the `creator` is set in the `initWallet` function and is not restricted to a specific address, any user who calls the `initWallet` function can become the `creator`. This means that any user can potentially transfer the entire balance of the wallet to another address, leading to a loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `creator` should be set to a specific address (e.g., the owner of the wallet) and not be changeable by any user. Additionally, the `migrateTo` function should be restricted to the `creator` only, ensuring that only the owner of the wallet can transfer the funds.",943,197,8.23482370376587

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `refund` function, which uses `msg.sender.transfer(balances[msg.sender]);` to send the balance back to the caller. This can be exploited by an attacker who is not the owner of the contract but has some funds in the contract.

In Solidity, `msg.sender` refers to the address that is currently calling the function. In the case of the `refund` function, an attacker can call this function and receive the funds, even though they are not the owner of the contract. This is because the function does not check if the caller is the owner of the contract or has any authorization to perform the refund.

To fix this vulnerability, the `refund` function should be modified to only allow the owner of the contract to perform the refund. This can be achieved by adding a modifier that checks if the caller is the owner and using it in the `refund` function.

Here's an example of how to fix the vulnerability:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Wallet {
    address creator;

    mapping(address => uint256) balances;

    constructor() public {
        creator = msg.sender",975,301,12.412956953048706
23,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the CustomToken contract, specifically in the constructor function CustomToken(). The issue is that the contract's creator (address 0xfb2555c0d788c0583b5f5a3a31744c73b0370fc6) is also the initial owner of the entire token supply. This means that the creator has full control over the token and can manipulate it without any restrictions.

This is a common access control issue in smart contracts, where the creator has unrestricted access to the contract's functionality and can potentially exploit it. In this case, the creator can transfer tokens to themselves or other addresses without any checks or balances, leading to potential loss of funds or other unintended consequences.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should be designed in a way that the creator does not have full control over the token supply and can't manipulate it without proper authorization. This can be achieved by implementing a more robust access control mechanism, such as using a separate contract to manage token ownership and transfers, or by introducing a multi-signature mechanism for critical operations.",608,269,11.099311590194702
24,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `changeOwner` function in the `Unprotected` contract. This function allows anyone to change the owner of the contract by calling it with the new owner's address as an argument. Since the `changeOwner` function is public and does not have any access control checks, it can be exploited by any user to change the ownership of the contract.

This can lead to various issues, such as unauthorized access to sensitive data, manipulation of contract logic, or even theft of funds if the contract holds any. To fix this vulnerability, the `changeOwner` function should be modified to include access control checks, ensuring that only the current owner or a designated authority can change the ownership of the contract.",712,170,7.129803657531738

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in both the `withdraw` function and the fallback function. The `delegatecall` allows the contract to execute code in the context of another contract, which can lead to access control issues if not properly managed. In this case, the `delegatecall` is used to call functions in the `fibonacciLibrary`, which could potentially be controlled by an attacker. If the attacker can deploy a malicious contract with the same selector as the `fibSig` or `msg.data`, they could execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the `FibonacciBalance` contract. This could lead to unauthorized access to funds or other sensitive operations.",1303,162,6.908088207244873

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function. The line `balanceOf[0xfb2555c0d788c0583b5f5a3a31744c73b0370fc6] = totalSupply;` is vulnerable to integer overflow.

In Solidity, the `mapping` data structure is initialized with a default value of 0. When assigning a value to a mapping key that does not exist, the default value is used. In this case, the default value is 0.

When the constructor function is called, the `balanceOf` mapping is being assigned the `totalSupply` value. However, since the mapping is initialized with a default value of 0, the assignment operation will result in an integer underflow. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities in the smart contract.

To fix this issue, the constructor function should be modified to ensure that the `balanceOf` mapping is properly initialized with the correct values.",555,247,10.19198203086853

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the `increaseLockTime` function, where the lock time for an address is increased by a certain number of seconds. If `_secondsToIncrease` is a very large number, it could cause an integer overflow, leading to unexpected behavior.

In Solidity, the `uint` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When an overflow occurs, the value wraps around to zero. This can lead to situations where the lock time is set to zero or a very small value, allowing the user to withdraw their funds earlier than intended.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflow and underflow. Here's an example of how you can use SafeMath to fix the vulnerability:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.10;

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the following lines:

1. Line 23: `require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`
2. Line 25: `balanceOf[msg.sender] += numTokens;`
3. Line 33: `msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`

In Solidity version 0.4.21, the `+=` and `*=` operators do not check for overflows and underflows. This means that if the result of the operation exceeds the maximum value of a uint256 (2^256 - 1), it will wrap around to 0, leading to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations that check for overflows and underflows. You can import the library and use its functions for addition and multiplication:

The line `count -= input;` can cause an underflow if the `input` is greater than the current value of `count`. In Solidity version 0.4.23, there is no built-in overflow or underflow checking, which makes the contract susceptible to this issue.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by calling the `run` function with a large `input` value, causing the `count` variable to underflow and potentially leading to unexpected behavior or even loss of funds.",667,153,6.380681753158569

In Solidity, the `uint256` type is an unsigned integer with a maximum value of 2^256 - 1. When assigning the `totalSupply` to the `balanceOf` mapping, if the `totalSupply` value is greater than the maximum value of `uint256`, it will cause an integer overflow.

In this case, the `totalSupply` is set to 1000000000000000000000000000 (1e23), which is within the range of `uint256`. However, if the `totalSupply` value were to be increased beyond the maximum value of `uint256`, it would cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect balance being assigned to the `balanceOf` mapping.

85,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the `CustomToken()` constructor function. The issue is that the `totalSupply` is set to a very large number (1000000000000000000000000000), and then the `balanceOf` mapping is updated with this value for the address `0xfb2555c0d788c0583b5f5a3a31744c73b0370fc6`.

The problem arises when the `balanceOf` mapping is accessed later in the contract. Since the `balanceOf` mapping is a `mapping` type, it does not have a default value. If the contract tries to access the balance for an address that has not been assigned a balance yet, it will result in an underflow, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially be exploited.

To fix this vulnerability, you can initialize the `balanceOf` mapping with a default value, such as 0, for all addresses. This can be done by adding a loop in the constructor function that iterates through all possible addresses and sets their balance to 0.

An attacker with sufficient resources could potentially predict or influence the block hash, thus affecting the outcome of the `rand` function.

Additionally, the use of a constant factor and the division by the maximum value in the `rand` function can lead to a limited and predictable range of outputs, which could be exploited by an attacker who can observe the contract's behavior over time.

The vulnerability lies in line 29:

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. In this case, the Collect function is vulnerable to reentrancy because it allows the external contract to call the Put function before the balance is updated.

An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the Collect function and then calls the Put function in the same transaction. This would result in the attacker being able to withdraw more funds than they should be able to, as the balance would not have been updated yet.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance before calling the external contract, or use a check-effect-interaction pattern to ensure that the balance is updated before any external calls are made.",1438,203,8.588810682296753
117,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function, specifically in line 24:

```solidity
(bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""");
```

At this point, the caller's code is executed, and it can call the `transfer` function, which modifies the state of the contract. This allows for a reentrancy attack, where an attacker can call the `withdrawBalance` function repeatedly before the initial execution is complete, draining funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which involves separating the logic that checks conditions and effects (updates the state) from the interactions (external calls). In this case, you should update the `userBalances` mapping before making the external call in the `withdrawBalance` function:

```solidity
function withdrawBalance() public {
    uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
    userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""");
    require(success);

126,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract. The issue is that the contract allows external calls to be made before the state changes (updating the user's balance) are completed. This can be exploited by a malicious contract that calls `withdrawBalance` recursively, potentially draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests that you should first perform all checks and effects (state changes) before interacting with external contracts. Here's an updated version of the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract that is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks:

129,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `resetInvestment` function, where the condition `if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp+ONE_MINUTE) throw;` is used to prevent the reset from happening too soon after the last investment. However, miners have the ability to manipulate the timestamp within a certain range, which could allow an attacker to bypass this condition by mining a block with a timestamp that is just over the `lastInvestmentTimestamp + ONE_MINUTE`. This would enable the attacker to call `resetInvestment` and potentially steal the jackpot.",1190,145,6.167216062545776
130,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same lines as the original code you provided:

1. Line 18: `require(now!= pastBlockTime);`
2. Line 20: `pastBlockTime = now;`

These lines ensure that only one transaction can be executed per block by comparing the current time (`now`) with the previously stored time (`pastBlockTime`). However, miners have some leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, which can be exploited to manipulate the time and potentially execute multiple transactions per block.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who can control a mining node, allowing them to manipulate the block timestamp and execute multiple transactions per block, leading to potential financial losses for the contract's users.",762,184,7.653962135314941
131,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same line as the first contract:

var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;

This line uses block.timestamp to generate a random number, which can be manipulated by miners. An attacker with enough hash power could influence the block timestamp to control the outcome of the random number generation, potentially winning the lottery multiple times or avoiding paying fees.",976,107,4.5815629959106445
132,short addresses," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to short address attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `sendCoin` function handles the `to` address parameter. In Solidity, addresses are 20 bytes long, but when passed as arguments to functions, they can be padded with zeros. If an attacker uses a short address (less than 20 bytes), the contract might interpret it as a different address, leading to funds being sent to an unintended recipient.

To fix this issue, the `sendCoin` function should explicitly check the length of the `to` address and reject any short addresses. Here's an updated version of the `sendCoin` function:

```solidity
function sendCoin(address to, uint amount) returns(bool sufficient) {
    if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) return false;
    if (to.length!= 20) return false;
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[to] += amount;
    Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
    return true;
}
```

This updated function checks the length of the `to` address and only proceeds with the transaction if the address is exactly 20 bytes long. This prevents short address attacks and ensures that funds are sent to the intended recipient.",969,301,12.45553183555603
133,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. An attacker can repeatedly call the `addCreditors` function to fill the `creditorAddresses` array until it reaches a length greater than 1500. Once this happens, the `emptyCreditors` function will be triggered, which clears the `creditorAddresses` array and sets the `win` variable to true. This can be exploited to disrupt the normal operation of the contract by repeatedly adding and removing creditors, effectively causing a DoS condition.",934,134,5.678717136383057
134,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles the dynamic resizing of the `array`. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the contract checks if `numElements` is equal to `array.length` and then increments `array.length` by 1.

In Solidity, when you try to access an array element that doesn't exist (i.e., the index is out of bounds), it will throw an exception and revert the transaction. However, in this case, the contract is not checking if the new `array.length` is within bounds before trying to access it. This can lead to an out-of-bounds access, causing the transaction to revert and potentially leading to a DoS attack if an attacker can repeatedly call this function with a large enough `numbers` value.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the `push` method to add elements to the array, which automatically handles resizing and prevents out-of-bounds access:

```solidity
function insertNnumbers(uint value, uint numbers) public {
    for (uint i = 0; i < numbers; i++) {
        array.push(value);
    }
}

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the reset of the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays when a new credit cycle starts.

136,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function, specifically in the line where it sends Ether to the addresses in `refundAddresses`. If any of the addresses in `refundAddresses` is a contract that requires a lot of gas to execute its fallback function, or if it's a contract that is not willing to accept Ether, the transaction will fail. Since the `refundAll` function sends Ether to each address in a loop, a single failure will cause the entire function to fail and revert all previous transactions in the loop. This can be exploited by an attacker to prevent the contract from refunding Ether to legitimate addresses.",961,161,6.806748628616333
137,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `ifillArray` function in the `DosOneFunc` contract. An attacker can repeatedly call this function, causing the contract to continuously fill the `listAddresses` array with the attacker's address until it reaches the limit of 1500 addresses. Once the limit is reached, the contract resets the array to an empty array, which is a wasteful operation and can potentially lead to a DoS condition if the contract is not designed to handle such a reset efficiently.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` contract inherits from the `BaseToken` contract, which means that the `ifillArray` function can be called on instances of the `CustomToken` contract as well. This could lead to a situation where the `CustomToken` contract is repeatedly called, causing the `listAddresses` array to be filled and reset, potentially leading to a DoS condition.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `ifillArray` function should be reviewed and potentially removed or modified to prevent abuse. Additionally, access control mechanisms should be implemented to restrict who can call this function.",779,263,10.897311687469482

```solidity
require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));
```

This line attempts to send the current bid amount to the current frontrunner. If the current frontrunner is a contract or a wallet that does not have enough Ether to cover the transaction, the transaction will fail, and the `require` statement will revert the entire transaction. This can be exploited by an attacker to repeatedly call the `bid` function with a high enough bid amount, causing the contract to revert and potentially exhaust the gas limit of the calling account, leading to a denial of service.",769,174,7.2668256759643555
