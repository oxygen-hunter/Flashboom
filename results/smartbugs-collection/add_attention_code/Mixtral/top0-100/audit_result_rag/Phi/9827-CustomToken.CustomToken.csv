11,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function of the `MultiOwnable` contract. The issue is that the `newOwner` function allows any user to become an owner of the contract by calling the function and passing their address as the `_owner` parameter. This means that any user can become an owner without the consent of the current owners, which is a significant access control issue.

The `newOwner` function should only allow the current owners to add new owners to the contract. This can be achieved by adding a check in the `newOwner` function to ensure that the caller is an existing owner before allowing them to add a new owner.

Here's an updated version of the `MultiOwnable` contract with the fix:

```solidity

12,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the `CustomToken()` constructor function. The issue is that the `owner` address is hardcoded and set to a fixed address, which could be controlled by an attacker if they manage to deploy the contract. This could lead to unauthorized access control issues if the `owner` address is not properly secured.",746,91,4.037304401397705
13,access control," YES

The given code is vulnerable due to the `creator` variable being publicly accessible and modifiable by anyone calling the `DynamicPyrami` function. This means that any user can change the `creator` address, which would allow them to bypass the `onlyowner` modifier and potentially execute unautrightful actions such as changing the owner, multiplier, fee percentage, and collecting fees.

To fix this vulnerability, the `creator` variable should be made `private` and the `DynamicPyrami` function should be modified to only allow the original creator to call it. This can be achieved by adding a constructor that sets the `creator` to the `msg.sender` and modifying the `DynamicPyrami` function to check if the `msg.sender` is equal to the `creator`.

The issue is that the `owner` address is hardcoded and set to a fixed address, which could be a mistake or an oversight. If this address is not intended to be the owner, it could lead to unauthorized access control issues.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` contract inherits from the `BaseToken` contract, which has a public `owner` variable. This means that the `owner` address is exposed and can be accessed by anyone. If the `owner` address is not meant to be public, this could also lead to access control issues.

Moreover, the `CustomToken` contract does not have any access control modifiers or checks in place to restrict access to its functions. This could potentially allow anyone to call the contract's functions, which could lead to unautrighted access and manipulation of the contract's state.",763,218,10.09947657585144

23,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the `CustomToken()` constructor function.

The issue is that the `CustomToken()` constructor function is public, which means that any user can call it and create a new instance of the `CustomToken` contract. This can lead to unauthorized creation of tokens and potential loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `CustomToken()` constructor function should be made private or restricted to a specific address (e.g., the owner of the contract). This can be done by adding the `internal` or `private` keyword to the function declaration, or by using a modifier to restrict access to the owner.

Here's an example of how to fix the vulnerability:

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract's constructor, specifically in the `CustomToken()` function. The `owner` address is hardcoded and set to a fixed address, which is publicly visible. This means that anyone can see the owner's address and potentially target it for further attacks.

Additionally, the `changeOwner` function in the `Unprotected` contract allows anyone to change the owner of the contract by calling it with a new address. This function should be restricted to only the current owner, but since the `owner` address is hardcoded in the `CustomToken` contract, it can be exploited by anyone who knows the address.

To fix this vulnerability, the `changeOwner` function should be modified to use the `onlyowner` modifier, ensuming that the `owner` address is not hardcoded and can be changed by the current owner.",744,203,8.689900159835815

The `delegatecall` allows the contract to execute code in the context of another contract, which can lead to access control issues if not properly managed. In this case, the `delegatecall` is used to call functions in the `fibonacciLibrary`, which could potentially be controlled by an attacker. If the attacker can deploy a malicious contract with the same selector as the `fibSig` or `msg.data`, they could execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the `FibonocciBalance` contract.",1335,147,6.395842790603638

In both cases, the contract is using the low-level send function without checking the return value. If the transaction fails for any reason (e.g., insufficient gas, the recipient's address is incorrect, or the recipient's account is empty), the contract will continue to execute without reverting the entire transaction. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the transfer function instead of send, which checks for errors and reverts the transaction if any issues are encountered. Here's an example of how to modify the code:

This can lead to incorrect balances and potentially allow for exploits where an attacker can manipulate the contract's state.

In Solidity version 0.4.1EE, the recommended way to prevent this is to use the SafeMath library, which includes built-in overflow checks. However, since the code is using Solidity version 0.4.15, the SafeMath library is not available.

To fix this vulnerability, you can manually check for overflows before performing the addition operation. Here's an example of how you can modify the `add` function to prevent overflow:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.15;

contract Overflow {
    uint private sellerBalance = 0;

    function add(uint value) public returns (bool) {
        if (sellerBalance + value < sellerBalance) {
            // Overflow occurred, return false
            return false;
        }
        sellerBalance += value;
        return true",615,301,12.505447387695312
90,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the line where the balance is updated for the recipient address:

```solidity
balanceOf[_to] += _value;
```

In Solidity, the `+=` operator performs an addition and then assigns the result back to the variable. If the result of the addition exceeds the maximum value of a uint256 (which is 2^256 - 1), it will wrap around to 0, causing an integer overflow. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as transferring more tokens than intended or even transferring 0 tokens, effectively stealing the tokens.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library provided by OpenZeppelin, which includes safe arithmetic operations that check for overflows and underflows. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath in the contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.10;

import ""https://github.com/OpenZeppelinSolidity/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol"";

93,bad randomness," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the randomness generation function `rand(uint max)` which is used to determine which entry gets paid. The function uses the block hash of the last block to generate a pseudo-random number. However, miners have some control over the block hash, and they can influence the outcome of the function by choosing a block hash that results in a specific index being selected. This can be exploited by a miner who is also a user of the contract to increase their chances of receiving a payout.

Additionally, the function `join()` allows users to join the game by sending ether, and the contract does not have any mechanism to prevent a user from joining multiple times with different addresses. This could potentially be exploited by a user who joins with multiple addresses to increase their chances of receiving a payout.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `supportsToken()` function within the `attack` contract. When the `supportsToken()` function is called, it checks if it has been called before. If not, it sets `hasBeenCalled` to true and calls the `airDrop()` function of the `ModifierEntrancy` contract. However, the `airDrop()` function modifies the state of the contract by adding tokens to the sender's balance.

The issue arises when the `airDrop()` function is called, and before it completes, the `supportsToken()` function returns control to the calling contract (the `attack` contract). This allows the `attack` contract to call the `airDrop()` function again, potentially leading to multiple calls to the `airDrop()` function in a single transaction. This can result in the `ModifierEntrancy` contract being reentered multiple times, leading to the loss of tokens.

123,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 29:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (the `msg.sender`) and sending Ether to it before updating the balance of the `acc` account. This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `Collect` function before the balance update is completed, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the balance update should be done before the external call, and the contract should use the `transfer` or `send` function instead of `call.value` to send Ether to the external contract.",1474,171,7.295413017272949

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (the `msg.sender`) and sending Ether to it before updating the balance of the sender. This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `CashOut` function before the balance update is completed, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance of the sender before calling the external contract. Here's an updated version of the `CashOut` function:

```solidity
function CashOut(uint _am)
{
    if(_am <= balances[msg.sender])

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (the msg.sender) and sending Ether to it before updating the balance of the msg.sender. This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `Collect` function before the balance update is completed, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance of the msg.sender before calling the external contract. Here's an updated version of the `Collect` function:

126,reentrancy," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract. The issue is that the contract allows external calls to be made before the state of the contract is updated. In this case, the `userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;` line is executed after the external call, which means that if the external call is a reentrant call, it can withdraw the balance again before the balance is set to zero.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the state before making any external calls. Here's an example of a secure implementation:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^00.5.0;

contract Reentrancy_secure {

    mapping (address => uint) private userBalances;

    function withdrawBalance() public {
        uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];

        userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;

        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""");
        require(success);
    }
}

In this secure implementation, the `userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;` line is executed before the external call",782,301,12.939257383346558
127,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `isSaleFinished()` function of the `TimedCrowdsale` contract, which relies on the `block.timestamp` to determine if the sale is finished. As mentioned earlier, the `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners to some extent, which can lead to incorrect results for time-based logic in smart contracts.",663,97,4.174524307250977
128,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation due to its reliance on block.timestamp for both the payOut function and the randomGen function. This can be exploited by miners who have control over the timestamp of the block they mine, potentially affecting the outcome of the contract's logic.",942,69,3.103492498397827
129,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the resetInvestment function, specifically in the line:

if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp+ONE_MINUTE) throw;

This line checks if the current block timestamp is at least one minute after the last investment timestamp before allowing the resetInvestment function to proceed. However, as mentioned in the provided explanation, the block.timestamp can be manipulated by miners, which means an attacker could potentially manipulate the timestamp to bypass this check and execute the resetInvestment function prematurely.",1222,134,5.749927759170532
130,time manipulation," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `require(now!= pastBlockTime);` statement, which ensures that only one transaction can be executed per block. However, miners have some leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, which can be exploited to manipulate the outcome of the contract's logic.",794,83,3.653348922729492
131,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same line as the first contract, line 43:

var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;

This line uses block.timestamp to generate a random number, which can be manipulated by miners. An attacker with control over the mining process could manipulate the block timestamp to influence the outcome of the random number generation, potentially affecting the distribution of winnings in the EtherLotto contract.",1008,117,5.755615472793579
132,short addresses," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to short address attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `sendCoin` function handles the `to` address. The `to` address is passed as a parameter without type checking or validation, which means an attacker could pass a short address (a shorter version of a full address) that still resolves to a valid address in the Ethereum network. This could lead to funds being sent to an unintended recipient.

To fix this vulnerability, the `sendEE` function should be updated to use the `address` type for the `to` parameter and perform proper validation on the address before processing the transaction. Additionally, the Ethereum community has proposed a solution called EIP-2959, which aims to address the short address issue by introducing a new address format that includes a checksum.",1001,186,7.853237867355347
133,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. This function can be exploited by repeatedly calling it to keep the `creditorAddresses` array at a length of 1500 or less. When the array length exceeds 150EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE",966,301,12.518139123916626
134,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the contract attempts to dynamically resize the `array` if `numElements` reaches the current length of the `array`.

In Solidity, arrays are fixed-size data structures, and their size cannot be changed after they are initialized. The line `array.length += 1;` is attempting to change the size of the array, which is not allowed in Solidity and will result in a compilation error. However, even if this line were to be removed, the logic of the function would still be problematic.

The function `insertNnumbers` takes two parameters: `value` and `numbers`. It then iterates `numbers` times, attempting to insert `value` into the `array`. If the `array` is not large enough to hold all the elements, the contract will attempt to resize the `array` (which is not possible), leading to an out-of-gas error and causing the transaction to fail. This can be exploited by an attacker by repeatedly calling the `insertNnumbers` function with a large value of `numbers`, causing the contract to run out of gas and become unresponsive.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should be modified to use a dynamic array type, such as `uint[]`, which allows",1093,301,14.018906831741333
135,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the reset of the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays when a new credit cycle starts. This can be exploited by repeatedly calling the `lendGovernmentMoney` function, which resets the arrays and potentially drains the contract's balance by repeatedly sending funds to the `corruptElite` address.",2517,98,4.867496013641357
136,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function, specifically in line 24:

```solidity
require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[sin]]);
```

The `send` function in Solidity can fail for various reasons, such as the recipient address not having enough balance or the transaction running out of gas. If any of the `send` calls fail, the entire `refundAll` function will fail due to the `require` statement, causing a denial of service. This means that if any of the refund addresses have insufficient balance or if there is an issue with the transaction, the refund process will be halted, and the funds will not be refunded.

Additionally, the `send` function is not the recommended way to transfer Ether in Solidity, as it can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential vulnerabilities. Instead, the `transfer` function should be used, which reverts the transaction if the transfer fails. However, even with the `transfer` function, the contract would still be vulnerable to a denial of service attack if the recipient address is not properly validated or if there are other issues with the recipient address.",993,294,12.620711326599121
137,denial of service," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function of the `DosOneFunc` contract. An attacker can repeatedly call this function, causing the contract to continuously fill the `listAddresses` array with the attacker's address. This can lead to the contract consuming all available gas, potentially causing it to become unresponsive or ""offline"" for other users.

The specific lines that make the contract vulnerable are:

1. Line 17: `for(uint i=0;i<350;i++) {`
2. Line 18: `listAddresses.push(msg.sender);`

These lines cause the contract to add 350 addresses to the `listAddresses` array for each call to the `ifillArray` function. If an attacker continuously calls this function, the contract will eventually run out of gas, making it unresponsive to other users.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you could add a gas limit to the `ifillArray` function or implement a mechanism to prevent repeated calls from the same address within a certain time frame.",811,269,11.319692850112915
138,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the same reason as the first contract: the require statement on line 23 that attempts to send the currentBid to the currentFrontrunner. If the currentFrontrunner's address is a contract that does not handle the Ether sent to it properly, or if it's a contract that requires a specific function to be called to accept Ether, the transaction will fail, causing a denial of service.",801,111,5.111361980438232
