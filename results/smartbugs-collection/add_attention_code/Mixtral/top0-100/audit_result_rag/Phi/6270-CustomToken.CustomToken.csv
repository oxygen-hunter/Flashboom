11,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function in the `MultiOwnable` contract. The issue is that the `newOwner` function allows any user to become an owner of the contract by calling the function and passing their address as the `_owner` parameter. This means that any user can become an owner without the consent of the current owners, which is a significant access control issue.

The `newOwner` function should only allow the current owner (root) to add new owners. This can be achieved by adding a check in the `newOwner` function to ensure that the `msg.sender` is the root owner before allowing the addition of a new owner.

Here's an updated version of the `MultiOwnable` contract with the fix:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.23;

contract MultiOwnable {
  address public root;
  mapping (address => address) public owners;  

   
  constructor() public {
    root = msg.sender;
    owners[root] = root;
  }

    require(owners[msg.sender]!= EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE",1105,301,12.498043775558472
12,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `msg.sender` in the `missing()` function to set the `owner` address. This allows any user to call the `missing()` function and become the owner of the contract, bypassing the intended access control mechanism.",766,64,2.7901084423065186
13,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `addPayout` function, where the `creator` address is not checked before sending Ether to the `Participant` addresses. This means that any user can call the `addPayout` function and send Ether to themselves, effectively draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `addPayout` function should be modified to include a check for the `creator` address before sending Ether to the `Participant` addresses. This can be done by adding a modifier that checks if the `msg.sender` is the `creator` and only allows the function to be called by the `creator`.

Here's an example of how the `addPayout` function can be modified to fix the vulnerability:

```solidity
modifier onlyCreator {
    require(msg.sender == creator, ""Caller is not the creator"");
    _;
}

function addPayout(uint _fee) onlyCreator public {
    //... existing code...
}
```

By adding the `onlyCreator` modifier and applying it to the `addPayout` function, we ensure that only the `creator` can call this function and send Ether to the `Participant",3427,301,13.53551435470581
14,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function, specifically in line 20:

require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);

This line allows any user to withdraw their balance, which is correct. However, the issue arises when considering the `migrateTo` function in the `Wallet` contract. The `migrateTo` function allows the `creator` to transfer the entire balance of the contract to another address. Since the `creator` is the only one who can call this function, it might seem like there is no access control issue.

However, if the `creator` address is compromised or controlled by an attacker, the attacker can transfer the entire balance of the contract to their own address. This is a significant access control issue, as it allows an attacker to drain the funds from the contract if they gain control of the `creator` address.

To mitigate this issue, the `migrateTo` function should be restricted to only allow the `creator` to transfer their own funds, not the entire balance of the contract. This can be achieved by adding an additional check in the `migrateTo` function to ensure that the `to` address is the same as the `creator` address.",968,290,12.043270111083984
15,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being updated with the `totalSupply` amount to the address `0x349a6206972761f0902a69930ca07977254c88c3` before the constructor finishes execution. This means that if the constructor is called multiple times (which can happen in a deployment scenario), the `balanceOf` mapping will be overwritten, and the previous balance will be lost.

This can lead to an incorrect distribution of tokens and potential loss of funds. To fix this issue, the `balanceOf` mapping should be updated after the constructor has finished executing.",783,186,7.7720046043396
16,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `set` function (line 20), which allows anyone to modify the `map` array by providing a `key` and a `value`. This means that any user can overwrite the values in the `map` array, potentially leading to unauthorized changes and data loss.

To fix this vulnerability, you should implement proper access control mechanisms, such as using a modifier to restrict access to the `set` function only to the owner or authorized users.",868,123,5.223531484603882
17,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in the `Proxy` contract. The `forward` function in the `Proxy` contract allows any contract to execute its code within the context of the `Proxy` contract, which can lead to unintended access control issues if the `callee` contract is not trusted.",720,77,3.309574604034424
18,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the access control issue in the `PopBonusCode` function. The condition `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length);` is always true because array lengths are unsigned and cannot be negative. This means that the `require` statement does not effectively prevent unauthorized access to the `PopBonusCode` function.",1002,83,3.6063740253448486
19,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. The `onlyowner` modifier checks if the `msg.sender` is equal to the `owner`, which is fine for basic access control. However, the issue arises with the `CustomToken` contract, which inherits from `BaseToken`. The constructor of `CustomToken` is marked as `public`, which means it can be called by any external account, not just the owner.

When the `CustomToken` contract is deployed, the `Constructor()` function of the `Missing` contract is called, and the `msg.sender` is set to the deployer of the `CustomToken` contract. This means that the deployer of the `CustomToken` contract becomes the owner of the `Missing` contract.

Now, if an attacker deploys a malicious contract that inherits from `CustomToken`, the attacker can call the `CustomToken()` constructor and become the owner of the `Missing` contract. This allows the attacker to call the `withdraw()` function and drain the funds from the `Missing` contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `Constructor()` function of the `Missing` contract should be marked as `internal` or `private`, so it can only be called from within the contract itself or by derived contracts.",769,301,12.384804248809814
20,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `migrateTo` function, which allows the `creator` of the contract to transfer the entire balance of the contract to any address they choose. Since the `creator` is set in the `initWallet` function and is not changed afterwards, any user who calls `initWallet` can set themselves as the `creator`. This means they can then call `migrateTo` to transfer all the funds to another address, effectively draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `creator` should be set to a fixed address (e.rights of the contract owner) and not be changeable by any other user. Additionally, the `migrateTo` function should be removed or restricted to only allow the contract owner to transfer funds.",995,190,7.979753017425537

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `refund` function, which uses `msg.sender.transfer(balances[msg.sender]);` to send the balance back to the caller. This can be exploited by an attacker who calls the `refund` function, as it does not properly check if the caller is authorized to perform the refund. This could lead to unauthorized transfers of funds from the contract.",1027,109,4.6930766105651855
23,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the access control issue present in the `CustomToken` contract. The vulnerability lies in the constructor of the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the line where the `Transfer` event is emitted:

```solidity
Transfer(address(0), 0x349a6206972761f0902a69930ca07977254c88c3, totalSupply);
```

This line emits a `Transfer` event that transfers the entire supply of tokens to the address `0x349a6206972761f0902a69930ca07977254c88c3`. This means that the creator of the contract has given themselves all the tokens, which is a significant access control issue.

A better approach would be to create a separate function to transfer tokens to the creator's address, and call that function in the constructor. This would make the access control more explicit and allow for better control over the token distribution.",660,258,10.663634300231934
24,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The `changeOwner` function in the `Unprotected` contract allows the owner to be changed, but there is no mechanism in place to prevent the `CustomToken` contract from calling `changeOwner` and changing the owner of the `Unprotected` contract.

In the `CustomToken` constructor, the `Transfer` event is emitted, which is not a vulnerability by itself. However, if the `Transfer` event is used to call the `changeOwner` function in the `Unprotected` contract, it would allow an attacker to change the owner of the `Unprotected` contract by sending a transaction to the `CustomToken` contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `changeOwner` function should be made private or removed, and the owner should be set in the constructor of the `Unprotected` contract. Additionally, the `CustomToken` contract should not be able to call the `changeOwner` function.",764,230,9.546427726745605

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `tx.origin` for access control in the `Phishable` contract. This can be exploited through phishing attacks where an attacker tricks the owner into signing a transaction that calls the `withdrawAll` function, allowing the attacker to drain the contract's funds.",745,78,3.3541626930236816
26,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in both the `withdraw` function and the fallback function. The `delegatecall` allows the contract to execute code in the context of another contract, which can lead to access control issues if not properly managed. In this case, the `withdraw` function and the fallback function are allowing any contract to call the `FibonacciLib` functions, which could lead to unauthorized access to the `calculatedFibNumber` state variable.

To fix this vulnerability, you should remove the `delegatecall` from both the `withdraw` function and the fallback function, and instead use direct function calls to the `FibonacciLib` contract. This will ensure that only the intended contract can access the `calculatedFibNumber` state variable.",1355,185,7.844908714294434

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function. The line `balanceOf[0x349a6206972761f0902a69930ca07977254c88c3] = totalSupply;` is vulnerable to integer overflow.

In Solidity, when assigning a value to a mapping, the value is implicitly converted to the key type. In this case, the `balanceOf` mapping has a `uint256` type, and `totalSupply` is also a `uint256`. When assigning `totalSupply` to the balanceOf mapping, the value is implicitly converted to `uint256`.

However, the `totalSupply` is initialized with a value of `1000000000000000000000000000`, which is a decimal literal. This literal is implicitly converted to a `uint256` type, but the conversion may cause an overflow if the literal is too large to fit in a `uint256`.

In this case, the literal is within the range of a `uint2048`, but not a `uint256",607,301,12.33869981765747

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an integer overflow in the `increaseLockTime` function. The issue lies in the line:

```solidity
lockTime[msg.sender] += _secondsToIncrease;
```

In Solidity, the `uint` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When an overflow occurs, the result wraps around to zero. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as setting the lock time to zero, which would allow the user to withdraw their funds immediately, even if they were not supposed to be able to do so.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflows and underflows. Here's an example of how you can modify the `increaseLockTime` function to use SafeMath:

```solidity
import ""@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol"";

pragma solidity ^0.4.10;

contract TimeLock {
    using SafeMath for uint;

2. Line 25: `balanceOf[msg.sender] += numTokens;`
3. Line 33: `msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`

In Solidity version 0.4.21, the `*` operator does not check for overflow or underflow. This means that if the result of the multiplication exceeds the maximum value of a uint256, it will wrap around to zero, leading to incorrect calculations and potentially allowing attackers to manipulate the contract's behavior.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflow and underflow. You can import the SafeMath library and use its functions for multiplication and addition.

Here's an example of how you can use SafeMath to fix the vulnerability:

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. In this case, the Collect function can be reentered by an attacker, potentially draining funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the state (acc.balance -= _am) before making the external call. This can be done by changing the order of lines 29 and 30:

acc.balance -= _am;
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

119,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 52:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (the withdrawal function) and sending Ether to it before updating the balance of the sender. This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `CashOut` function again, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance of the sender before sending Ether to the external contract. This can be done by moving the line `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;` before the external call.

Here's the updated `CashOut` function:

```solidity
function CashOut(uint _am)

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (in this case, the msg.sender) and sending Ether to it before updating the balances. This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `Collect` function before the balance update is completed, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance before sending Ether to the external contract. Here's an example of how to fix the vulnerability:

```solidity

123,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 29:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. In this case, the Collect function is vulnerable to reentrancy because it allows the external contract to call the Put function before the balance is deducted.

An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the Collect function and then calls the Put function before the balance is deducted. This would result in the attacker being able to withdraw more funds than they are entitled to.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, where all checks and effects are performed before any external interactions. In this case, the balance should be deducted before calling the external contract.

Here's an example of how the Collect function can be modified to prevent the reentrancy attack:

function Collect(uint _am)
    public
    payable
    {
        var acc = Acc[msg.sender];

126,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract. The issue is that the contract allows external calls to be made before the state of the contract is updated. In this case, the `userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;` line is executed after the external call, which means that if the external call is a reentrant call, it can withdraw the balance again before the balance is updated to 0.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the state before making any external calls. Here's an example of a secure implementation:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract SecureReentrancy {

    mapping (address => uint) private userBalances;

    function withdrawBalance() public {
        uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];

        userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;

        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""");
        require(success);
    }
}

127,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `isSaleFinished()` function of the `TimedCrowdsale` contract, which relies on the `block.timestamp` to determine if the sale is finished.

129,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the resetInvestment function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp+ONE_MINUTE)
```

This line checks if the current block timestamp is at least one minute after the last investment timestamp. However, miners have the ability to manipulate the block timestamp within a certain range (usually 15 seconds). This means that an attacker could potentially mine a block with a timestamp that is just under one minute after the last investment timestamp, bypassing the resetInvestment function and allowing them to reset the jackpot without actually waiting for the required time to pass.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a more reliable source of time or implement a mechanism that is not solely dependent on the block timestamp.",1242,193,8.14356541633606
130,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same lines as the previous code:

- Line 18: `require(now!= pastBlockTime);`
- Line 20: `pastBlockTime = now;`

These lines ensure that only one transaction per block can transfer the balance to the sender. However, miners have some leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, which can be manipulated to a certain extent. This means that a miner could potentially delay the block confirmation to manipulate the outcome of the contract's logic.

In this case, a malicious miner could delay the block confirmation to make sure that the `now % 15 == 0` condition is not met, preventing the transfer of funds to the sender. This could be exploited by the miner to keep the funds in the contract for a longer period, potentially leading to other vulnerabilities or manipulations.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a more reliable time source or to implement a time lock mechanism that does not rely soleright on the block timestamp.",814,253,10.45988941192627

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. An attacker can repeatedly call the `addCreditors` function to fill the `creditorAddresses` array until it reaches a size of 1500. Once this threshold is reached, the `emptyCreditors` function will be triggered, which clears the `creditorAddresses` array and sets the `win` variable to true. This can be exploited to disrupt the normal operation of the contract by repeatedly triggering the `emptyCreditors` function, effectively denying service to legitimate users who are trying to interact with the contract.",986,149,6.300705432891846
134,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the contract attempts to dynamically resize the `array` if `numElements` is equal to `array.length`.

In Solidity, arrays are fixed-size data structures, and their size cannot be changed once they are initialized. The line `array.length += 1;` is attempting to change the size of the array, which is not allowed and will result in a runtime error. This error will cause the transaction to revert, effectively denying service to the user who initiated the transaction.

To fix this vulnerability, you should initialize the array with a fixed size that is sufficient to hold the maximum number of elements you expect to store in it. Alternatively, you can use a dynamic array like `uint[]` without specifying the size, which will allow the array to grow as needed. However, keep in mind that resizing a dynamic array can be expensive in terms of gas costs, so it's essential to consider the trade-offs between fixed and dynamic arrays in your specific use case.",1113,248,10.363989353179932
135,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the reset of the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays when a new credit cycle starts.

136,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));
```

This line attempts to send Ether to each address in the `refundAddresses` array. If any of these addresses fail to accept the Ether (either because they are not online, or they have insufficient gas, or for any other reason), the entire transaction will fail and all Ether sent to that point will be stuck in a pending state. This can lead to a denial of service, as the contract will not be able to refund the Ether to the original sender.

Additionally, the `send` function is a low-level function that only sends Ether and does not revert the transaction if the Ether transfer fails. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as the contract being in an inconsistent state.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you can use the `transfer` function instead of `send`, which reverts the transaction if the Ether transfer fails. You can also add checks to ensure that the addresses in the `refundAddresses` array are valid and can receive Ether.",1013,291,12.110968351364136
137,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function of the `DosOneFunc` contract. An attacker can repeatedly call this function to fill the `listAddresses` array with their address. Once the array reaches its maximum size (1500 in this case), the function will clear the array, but the attacker can keep calling the function to keep the contract busy and potentially disrupt its normal operation.

This type of DoS attack can be particularly harmful in the context of smart contracts, as it can lead to service disruption and potentially prevent legitimate users from interacting with the contract.",831,153,6.425779819488525
