11,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function in the `MultiOwnable` contract.

The issue is that the `newOwner` function allows any user to become an owner by calling the function and passing their address as the `_owner` parameter. This means that any user can become an owner, even if they are not the root owner or an existing owner. This can lead to unauthorized users gaining control over the contract's functionality and potentially causing harm.

To fix this vulnerability, the `newOwner` function should be modified to only allow the root owner or existing owners to add new owners. This can be achieved by adding an additional check in the `newOwner` function to ensure that the user calling the function is either the root owner or an existing owner.",1103,184,7.96513819694519
12,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, which inherits from the `BaseToken` contract. The issue is with the constructor of the `CustomToken` contract, specifically the line:

```solidity
balanceOf[0x57cad6a4c83286406fd0fc9218931b3b83853e65] = totalSupply;
```

This line assigns the entire token supply to a single address (0x57cad6a4c83286406fd0fc9218931b3b83853e65) during contract deployment. This means that the owner of this address will have full control over the token supply, which is a significant access control issue.

The `owner` variable in the `Missing` contract is set to `msg.sender` when the `missing` function is called. Since the `missing` function is public, any user can call it and set themselves as the owner of the `Missing` contract. This allows them to call the `withdraw` function and transfer all the balance of the `Missing` contract to themselves.

In summary, the vulnerability is due to the combination of the `CustomToken` contract assigning",764,301,12.540191411972046

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the `msg.sender` check in the `DynamicPyramid` function. This function allows any user to call it and set the `creator` variable to their address. This means that any user can become the owner of the contract, which can lead to unauthorized access and control over the contract's functionality.

To fix this vulnerability, the `DynamicPyramid` function should only be callable by the original deployer of the contract or a designated admin address. This can be achieved by using a modifier that checks if the `msg.sender` is the deployer or admin address.",3425,143,7.222316741943359

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);
```

This line allows any user to withdraw their balance, which is correct. However, the issue arises when considering the `migrateTo` function:

```solidity
function migrateTo(address to) public {
    require(creator == msg.sender);
    to.transfer(this.balance);
}
```

In this function, the `creator` can transfer the entire contract balance to any address. This means that the `creator` has unrestricted access to the contract's funds, which is a significant access control vulnerability.

To fix this issue, the `migrateTo` function should be restricted to only allow the `creator` to transfer their own balance, not the entire contract balance. This can be achieved by adding an additional check in the `migrateTo` function to ensure that the `to` address is the `creator`'s address.",966,253,11.218151092529297
15,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being updated with the `totalSupply` before the constructor has finished executing. This can lead to a situation where the `balanceOf` mapping is accessible and modifiable by other contracts or functions before the contract is fully initialized, potentially leading to an attack where the initial balance is changed.

To fix this vulnerability, the `balanceOf` mapping should be updated after the constructor has finished executing. This can be done by moving the line `balanceOf[0x57cad6a4c83286406fd0fc9218931b3b83853e65] = totalSupply;` after the `Transfer` event emission line.",781,198,8.215989589691162

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `set` function (line 20), which allows anyone to modify the `map` array by providing a `key` and a `value`.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the access control issue in the `PopBonusCode` function. The condition `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length);` is always true because array lengths are unsigned and cannot be negative. This means that the `require` statement does not effectively prevent unauthorized access to the `PopBonusCode` function.",1000,83,3.789376974105835
19,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. The `onlyowner` modifier checks if the `msg.sender` is equal to the `owner`, which is fine for basic access control. However, the issue arises with the `CustomToken` contract, which inherits from `BaseToken`. The constructor of `CustomToken` is marked as `public`, which means it can be called by any external account, not just the owner.

When the `CustomToken` contract is deployed, the `Constructor` function of the `CustomToken` contract is called, which sets the `totalSupply` and other token properties. However, since the `Constructor` function is public, any external account can deploy the `CustomToken` contract, effectively bypassing the `onlyowner` modifier in the `Missing` contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `CustomToken` contract's constructor should be marked as `internal` or `private`, so that only the deploying account can call it. Additionally, the `Missing` contract should be updated to use the `msg.sender` instead of `tx.origin` for access control checks.",767,261,11.464738607406616

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `msg.sender` in the `initWallet` function without proper access control. This allows any user to set the `creator` address, which is then used as a guard in the `migrateTo` function to prevent the creator from transferring the contract's balance to another address.

23,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the access control issue present in the `CustomToken` contract. The vulnerability lies in the constructor of the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the line where it assigns the total supply to the address `0x57cad6a4c83286406fd0fc9218931b3b83853e65`:

```solidity
balanceOf[0x57cad6a4c83286406fd0fc9218931b3b83853e65] = totalSupply;
```

This line of code assigns the entire token supply to a single address, which is a security risk. If an attacker gains control of this address, they would have control over the entire token supply. This is a form of access control bypass, as the contract is not properly validating or restricting who can receive the entire token supply.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should implement a more secure way of distributing the token supply, such as using a crowdsale or airdrop mechanism that distributes tokens to multiple addresses, or by implementing a more secure access control mechanism to ensure that only authorized addresses can receive the entire token supply.",658,293,12.503496170043945
24,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The `balanceOf` mapping is being set for the address `0x57cad6a4c83286406fd0fc9218931b3b83853e65` with the entire total supply of tokens. This means that the address `0x57cad6a4c83286406fd0fc9218931b3b83853e65` has full control over the tokens, and if this address is compromised or falls into the wrong hands, the entire token supply could be at risk.

Additionally, the `changeOwner` function in the `Unprotected` contract allows anyone to change the owner of the contract without any restrictions. This means that if the `CustomToken` contract is somehow linked to the `Unprotected` contract, an attacker could change the owner of the `Unprotected` contract and gain control over the `CustomToken` contract as well.

To fix this vulnerability, the `CustomToken` contract should not pre-assign the entire token supply to a single address. Instead, the tokens should be distributed among multiple addresses or through a more secure distribution mechanism. The `change",762,301,12.635047435760498

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in both the `withdraw` function and the fallback function. The `delegatecall` allows the contract to execute code in the context of another contract, which can lead to access control issues if not properly managed. In this case, the `withdraw` function and the fallback function are allowing any contract to call the `FibonacciLib` functions, which could lead to unauthorized access to the `calculatedFibNumber` state variable.

To fix this vulnerability, you should remove the `delegatecall` from both the `withdraw` function and the fallback function, and instead use direct function calls to the `FibonacciLib` contract.

The vulnerability lies in the same lines as the original code you provided:

1. Line 54: owner2.send(sum2);
2. Line 65: owner.send(balance);

In both cases, the contract is using the low-level send function to transfer funds. The send function does not revert the transaction if the transfer fails, and it does not throw an error. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds if the transfer fails for some reason.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the transfer function instead of send. The transfer function will revert the transaction if the transfer fails, providing better error handling and preventing potential loss of funds.

31,unchecked low level calls," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to unchecked low-level calls.

The vulnerability lies in the `transfer` function of the `airPort` contract, which uses the `call` low-level function to transfer tokens from one address to another. The `call` function is used without checking its return value, which can lead to fail-open situations and other unwanted outcomes.

In the provided code, the `transfer` function in the `airPort` contract calls the `call` function on the `caddress` with the `id`, `from`, `_tos[i]`, and `v` parameters. However, it does not check the return value of the `call` function, which can be either `true` or `false`. If the `call` function returns `false`, it means that the transaction has failed, but the code will continue to execute without handling the failure.

In the context of the OddsAndEvens contract, this could allow a malicious user to predict the outcome of the game and copy the transaction with a higher gas fee to receive the winnings before the original transaction is processed. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that the contract does not have any mechanism to prevent duplicate transactions or to ensure that only one transaction per user is processed.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract could implement a mechanism to prevent duplicate transactions or to ensure that only one transaction per user is processed.

Solidity version 0.4.23 does not have built-in overflow checks, and the operations in the functions `overflowaddtostate`, `overflowmultostate`, `underflowtostate`, `overflowlocalonly`, `overflowmulocalonly`, and `underflowlocalonly` can lead to overflow and underflow issues.",1033,101,4.646981477737427
87,arithmetic," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the same type of arithmetic overflow issue as the first example. The vulnerability lies in the `transfer` function, specifically in the lines:

```solidity
require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
```

In Solidity version 0.4.18, the `uint` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When subtracting `_value` from `balances[msg.sender]`, if the result is less than zero, it will wrap around to a very large positive number due to the nature of unsigned integer arithmetic. This can lead to an incorrect balance update and potentially allow the attacker to drain funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations, or upgrade to a newer Solidity version (0.8.x or above) that includes built-in overflow checks.",875,226,9.473003149032593
88,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the `CustomToken()` constructor function. The line `balanceOf[0x57cad6a4c83286406fd0fc9218931b3b83853e65] = totalSupply;` is vulnerable to integer overflow.

In Solidity, when assigning a value to a mapping, the right-hand side of the assignment is implicitly converted to the type of the mapping's value. In this case, the `balanceOf` mapping has a type of `uint256`, and `totalSupply` is also a `uint256`. However, the value of `totalSupply` is 1e24, which is a very large number.

When assigning this large value to the `balanceOf` mapping, there is a risk of integer overflow. If the value of `totalSupply` exceeds the maximum value of a `uint2EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE` (2^256 - 1), the assignment will result in an incorrect value being stored in the `balanceOf` mapping. This can lead to incorrect balances and potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the contract's state.

89,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to arithmetic overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `add` function of the `Overflow` contract. When the `value` being added to `sellerBalance` is large enough, it can cause an overflow, leading to incorrect results. This can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the contract's state or cause unexpected behavior.

In Solidity version 0.4.15, there is no built-in overflow protection, so it's essential to implement checks manually to prevent overflows.",633,122,5.365552663803101
90,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the line `balanceOf[_to] += _value;` in the `transfer` function of the `IntegerOverflowAdd` contract. In Solidity version 0.4.10, there is no built-in overflow checking for unsigned integer operations. If the addition of `_value` to `balanceOf[_to]` results in an overflow, the value will wrap around to a smaller number, leading to incorrect balances and potential loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflows. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath in the `transfer` function:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.10;

import ""./SafeMath.sol"";

contract IntegerOverflowAdd {
    using SafeMath for uint256;

    mapping (address => uint256) public balanceOf;

91,bad randomness," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `blockhash` for randomness. The `blockhash` function returns the hash of the block at a given block number. However, this hash is predictable and can be influenced by miners, as they can choose which transactions to include in a block. This predictability can be exploited by a malicious user who can observe the blockchain and predict the `blockhash` for future blocks.

In the `settle` function, the contract uses `blockhash(guesses[msg.sender].block)` to generate the answer. Since the `blockhash` is predictable, a malicious user can observe the blockchain and predict the `blockhash` for the block number specified in the `guesses` mapping. This allows them to lock in a guess that will always match the `blockhash`, enabling them to win the challenge and receive the 2 ether reward.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a more secure source of randomness, such as an off-chain random number generation service or a decentralized randomness beacon like Chainlink VRF.",1043,248,10.480602741241455

If the external contract is malicious and has a fallback function that calls back into the CashOut function, it can repeatedly withdraw funds until the balance is depleted.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance before making the external call, or use checks-effects-interactions pattern to ensure that all state changes are made before any external calls are made.",1372,185,7.949630498886108
123,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 29:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the `msg.sender` to make a recursive call to the `Collect` function before the initial execution is complete. If the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract, it can exploit this vulnerability by implementing a reentrancy attack, which can lead to unauthorized withdrawals or other unintended behaviors.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests that you should first perform all checks and effects (state changes) before interacting with external contracts. In this case, you should deduct the `_am` amount from the `acc.balance` before making the external call. Here's an updated version of the `Collect` function:

function Collect(uint _am)
    public
    payable
    {
        var acc = Acc[msg.sender];
        if( acc.balance>=MinSum && acc.balance>=_am && now>acc.unlockTime)
        {
            acc.balance-=_am;

124,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 38 of the CashOut function:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This line allows the `msg.sender` to make a call to an external contract before the execution of the CashOut function is complete. If the external contract being called is malicious and has a fallback function designed to re-enter the CashOut function, it can repeatedly withdraw funds from the PrivateBank contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you should follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern, which means performing all necessary checks and updates before interacting with external contracts. Here's an updated version of the CashOut function:

```solidity
function CashOut(uint _am) public payable {
    if (_am <= balances[msg.sender]) {
        balances[msg.sender] -= _am;
        TransferLog.AddMessage(msg.sender, _am, ""CashOut"");

        (bool sentVal, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _am}("""");

The vulnerability lies in line 54:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (the msg.sender) and sending Ether to it before updating the balance. If the external contract is malicious and has a fallback function that calls back into the `Collect` function of the `BANK_SAFE` contract, it can potentially withdraw more funds than it should be allowed to. This is because the balance update (`balances[msg.sender]-=_am;`) is not executed until after the external call returns, allowing the malicious contract to drain funds from the `BANK_SAFE` contract.",1548,183,8.29094648361206
126,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract. The issue is that the contract allows external calls to be made before the state of the contract is updated. In this case, the `userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;` line is executed after the external call, which means that if the external call is a reentrant call, it can withdraw the balance again before the balance is updated to zero.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the state before making external calls, or use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which involves checking conditions, updating the state, and then interacting with external contracts.",800,172,7.711759090423584
127,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `isSaleFinished()` function of the `TimedCrowdsale` contract, which relies on the `block.timestamp` to determine if the sale is finished. As mentioned earlier, the `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners to some extent, which can lead to incorrect results for time-based logic in smart contracts.",681,97,4.120810508728027
128,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation due to the reliance on block.timestamp for both the payOut function and the randomGen function. This can be exploited by miners to manipulate the reported time, affecting the contract's behavior.",960,59,2.6343677043914795
129,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the resetInvestment function, specifically in the line:

if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp+ONE_MINUTE) throw;

This line checks if the current block timestamp is at least one minute after the last investment timestamp before allowing the resetInvestment function to proceed. However, miners have the ability to manipulate the block timestamp within a certain range (usually 15 seconds). This means that an attacker could potentially mine a block with a timestamp that is just under one minute after the last investment timestamp, bypassing the time check and triggering the resetInvestment function.

As a result, the attacker could exploit this vulnerability to reset the jackpot and steal the funds from the last investor, as well as the owner's balance.",1240,194,8.312627077102661
130,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same lines as the previous code:

- Line 18: `require(now!= pastBlockTime);`
- Line 20: `pastBlockTime = now;`

These lines ensure that only one transaction per block can transfer the balance to the sender. However, miners have some leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred. An attacker can exploit this by mining a block with a timestamp that is a multiple of 15 seconds after the previous block's timestamp. This would allow the attacker to transfer the balance to themselves multiple times within a short period, potentially draining the contract's funds.",812,162,7.094630718231201
131,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same line as the first contract, line 43:

var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;

This line uses block.timestamp to generate a random number, which can be manipulated by miners. An attacker with control over the mining process could manipulate the block timestamp to influence the outcome of the random number generation, potentially affecting the distribution of winnings in the EtherLotto contract.",1026,117,5.014989852905273
132,short addresses," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to short address attacks. The vulnerability lies in the `sendCoin` function, where the `address` type is used without explicitly checking for the full length of the address. In Solidity, the `address` type is 20 bytes, but when passing an address to a function, it is recommended to use the `address payable` type and check for the full length of the address to prevent short address attacks.

To fix this vulnerability, you can modify the `sendCoin` function to use `address payable` and check for the full length of the address:

```solidity
function sendCoin(address payable to, uint amount) returns(bool sufficient) {
    if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) return false;
    balances[msgEE.sender] -= amount;
    balances[to] += amount;
    Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
    return true;
}
```

By using `address payable` and checking for the full length of the address, you can prevent short address attacks in this smart contract.",1019,253,10.75151777267456
133,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `emptyCreditors` function can be called repeatedly to keep clearing the `creditorAddresses` array, which can lead to a situation where the contract is unable to process legitimate transactions or functions that depend on the `creditorAddresses` array.

In the provided code, the `emptyCreditors` function checks if the length of the `creditorAddresses` array is greater than 1500. If it is, the function clears the array and sets the `win` variable to true. An attacker can repeatedly call the `addCreditors` function to add addresses to the `creditorAddresses` array, and then call the `emptyCreditors` function to clear the array. This can be done in a loop or by using recursive calls, leading to a Denial of Service attack.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you can add a check to prevent the `emptyCreditors` function from being called too frequently or by the same address. Additionally, you can limit the rate at which the `addCreditors` function can be called or implement a mechanism to prevent the same address from adding multiple times in a short period.",984,286,12.090222358703613
134,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles the dynamic resizing of the `array` when inserting elements. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the contract checks if `numElements` is equal to `array.length` and then increments `array.length` by 1.

In Solidity, when you try to access an element of an array at an index that is out of bounds, it will throw an exception and revert the transaction. However, in this case, the contract is not checking if the new `array.length` is within bounds before trying to access it. This can lead to an out-of-bounds access, causing the transaction to revert and effectively denying service to the user who initiated the transaction.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the `push` method to add elements to the array, which automatically handles resizing and prevents out-of-bounds access. Here's an updated version of the `insertNnumbers` function:

```solidity
function insertNnumbers(uint value, uint numbers) public {
    for (uint i = 0; i < numbers; i++) {
        array.push(value);
    }
}

135,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the reset of the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays when a new credit cycle starts. This can be exploited by repeatedly calling the `lendGovernmentMoney` function, which resets the arrays and effectively clears the list of creditors and their amounts. This could be used to disrupt the contract's intended functionality and potentially cause financial harm to legitimate users.",2535,111,5.539231538772583
136,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function, specifically in line 24:

```solidity
require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));
```

This line attempts to send Ether to each address in the `refundAddresses` array. If any of the `send` operations fail, the entire `refundAll` function will fail due to the `require` statement. This can be exploited by an attacker who can control one of the addresses in the `refundAddresses` array. By sending a transaction to that address, the attacker can cause the `refundAll` function to fail, effectively denying service to all other addresses in the array.

Additionally, the `send` function itself is considered unsafe and can lead to denial of service attacks. It is recommended to use the `transfer` function instead, which reverts the entire transaction if the transfer fails. However, even with `transfer`, the same vulnerability would still exist if an attacker can control one of the addresses in the `refundAddresses` array.",1011,267,11.177095890045166
137,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function of the `DosOneFunc` contract. An attacker can repeatedly call this function, causing the `listAddresses` array to fill up with the attacker's address. Once the array reaches its maximum size of 1500, the function will clear the array by setting it to a new empty array. This process can be repeated indefinitely, causing the contract to consume resources and potentially leading to a Denial of Service condition.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the `ifillArray` function, which will consume gas and potentially overload the contract's execution environment. This can lead to a Denial of Service condition, where the contract becomes unresponsive or unavailable to legitimate users.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should implement a mechanism to limit the rate at which the `ifillArray` function can be called, or to prevent the function from being called by the same address repeatedly.",829,240,10.123104095458984
138,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the same reason as the first contract. The vulnerability lies in line 23:

```solidity
require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));
```

This line attempts to send the current bid amount to the current frontrunner. If the current frontrunner's address is a contract that does not have a fallback function or if the fallback function is not implemented correctly, the transaction will fail, and the contract will revert. This can be exploited by an attacker to repeatedly call the `bid` function with a higher bid, causing the contract to revert and effectively denying service to other users trying to bid.",819,165,7.0300092697143555
