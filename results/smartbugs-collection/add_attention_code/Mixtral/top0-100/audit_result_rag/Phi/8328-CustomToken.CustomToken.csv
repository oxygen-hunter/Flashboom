11,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. Although it is not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, it is a common practice in Solidity contracts to use `tx.origin` to check the original sender of a transaction. However, this approach is not secure because it can be bypassed by contracts that call the vulnerable contract.

In the provided code, the `onlyOwner` modifier is used to restrict access to certain functions. However, if a malicious contract calls the `newOwner` or `deleteOwner` functions, it can bypass the `onlyOwner` check because the `msg.sender` in the context of the malicious contract will not be the original owner.

To fix this vulnerability, you should replace the `onlyOwner` modifier with a more secure access control mechanism, such as using a whitelist of authorized addresses or implementing a proxy pattern with a separate contract for access control.",1042,216,9.026597023010254
12,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. The `onlyowner` modifier checks if the `msg.sender` is equal to the `owner` address, which is a good practice. However, the vulnerability arises from the fact that `msg.sender` can be spoofed in certain situations, such as when interacting with the contract through a contract that does not properly forward the original sender's address.

In this case, the `CustomToken` contract inherits from the `BaseToken` contract and does not override the `transfer` function. If an attacker deploys a malicious contract that calls the `transfer` function of `CustomToken`, the `msg.sender` will be the address of the malicious contract, not the actual user. This can bypass the `onlyowner` modifier and allow unauthorized access to the `withdraw` function.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a more secure method for access control, such as using a whitelist of authorized addresses or implementing a more robust access control mechanism that does not rely soleright on `msg.sender`.",703,261,10.70849061012268
13,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `addPayout` function, where the `creator` address is not checked before sending Ether to the `Participant` addresses. This means that any user can call the `addPayout` function and send Ether to the `Participant` addresses, potentially draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `addPayout` function should be modified to include a modifier that checks if the caller is the `creator` address before executing the function. This can be done by adding a modifier like `onlycreator` and using it in the `addPayout` function.

Here's an example of how the modified code would look like:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.15;

contract Rubixi {

    
    uint private balance = 0;
    uint private collectedFees = 0;

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function, specifically in line 20:

require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);

This line allows any user to withdraw their balance, but it does not prevent the user from withdrawing more than their balance. The `require` statement checks if the requested amount is greater than or equal to the user's balance, but it does not prevent the user from withdrawing more than their balance. This can lead to a situation where a user can drain the contract's funds by repeatedly calling the `withdraw` function with an amount greater than their balance.

To fix this vulnerability, the `require` statement should be modified to check if the requested amount is less than or equal to the user's balance:

require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);

This change ensures that users can only withdraw their balance or a portion of it, preventing them from draining the contract's funds.",905,226,9.395134210586548
15,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being accessed using a hardcoded address `0x1052ed7429d00a45fff1dbc52c2a28e398fe81db` without any access control checks. This means that any function within the `CustomToken` contract can access and modify the balance of this address without any restrictions.

This can lead to potential issues if other functions in the `CustomToken` contract are not properly designed with access control in mind. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious contract that interacts with the `CustomToken` contract and manipulates the balance of the hardcoded address.

To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement access control checks within the `CustomToken` contract, ensuring that only authorized functions can access and modify the `balanceOf` mapping.",720,229,9.460819005966187

19,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function. The issue is that the `CustomToken` contract is deploying the `CustomToken` contract itself, which can lead to an infinite loop of deployments if not handled correctly. This is a form of reentrancy attack, where the constructor function is called recursively without proper checks.

In the `CustomToken` constructor, the `CustomToken()` function is called, which in turn calls the `CustomToken()` constructor again, leading to an infinite loop. This can cause the contract to run out of gas or potentially be exploited by an attacker.

To fix this issue, you can remove the constructor call from the `CustomToken` contract and deploy the contract separately.",706,172,7.158177137374878

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `migrateTo` function, which allows the `creator` to transfer the contract's balance to any address. Since the `creator` is set in the `initWallet` function and is not protected, any user who calls `initWallet` can set themselves as the `creator`. This allows them to bypass the `require(creator == msg.sender);` check in the `migrateTo` function and transfer the contract's balance to any address they choose.

To fix this vulnerability, the `creator` should be set in the constructor of the contract and not be modifiable by any public function. Additionally, it would be better to use a modifier to restrict access to the `migrateTo` function only to the `creator`.",932,189,7.911888837814331

The vulnerability lies in the `changeOwner` function of the `Unprotected` contract. This function allows anyone to change the owner of the contract by calling it with the new owner's address as an argument. Since the `changeOwner` function is public and does not have any access control checks, it can be exploited by any user to change the ownership of the contract.

This can lead to various issues, such as unauthorized access to sensitive data, manipulation of contract logic, or even theft of funds if the contract holds any. To fix this vulnerability, the `changeOwner` function should be modified to include access control checks, ensuring that only the current owner or a designated authority can change the ownership of the contract.",701,170,7.084509611129761

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in both the `withdraw` function and the fallback function. The `delegatecall` allows the contract to execute code in the context of another contract, which can lead to access control issues if not properly managed. In this case, the `withdraw` function and the fallback function are allowing any contract to call the `FibonacciLib` functions, which could lead to unauthorized access to the contract's logic and state.",1292,114,4.93489933013916

pragma solidity ^0.4.10;

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the following lines:

1. Line 23: `require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`
2. Line 25: `balanceOf[msg.sender] += numTokens;`
3. Line 33: `msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`

In Solidity version 0.4.21, the `uint256` type does not have built-in overflow and underflow checks. This means that if the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum value of `uint256` (2^256 - 1), it will wrap around to 0, leading to incorrect results and potential vulnerabilities.

In the provided code, if the `numTokens` variable is large enough, the multiplication operation in lines 23 and 33 could result in an overflow, causing incorrect calculations and potentially allowing attackers to manipulate the contract's behavior.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use a library like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath, which provides arithmetic operations with built-in overflow and underflow checks. Alternatively, you can upgrade to a newer Solidity version (0",1032,301,12.41562533378601
83,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being set to a large value (totalSupply) for the address `0x1052ed7429d00a45fff1dbc52c2a28e398fe81db`. If the `balanceOf` mapping does not have enough space to store such a large value, it could cause an integer overflow.

In Solidity, the `mapping` type is a hash table, and the key-value pairs are stored in an array. The size of the array is determined by the number of elements stored in it. If the `balanceOf` mapping does not have enough space to store the large value, it could cause an integer overflow, leading to incorrect balances and potential vulnerabilities.

To fix this issue, you can use the `uint256` type with a modifier that checks for overflow, such as the `SafeMath` library from OpenZeppelin Contracts. This library provides functions that perform arithmetic operations with built-in overflow checks.",656,269,11.07017183303833
84,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the CustomToken contract, specifically in the constructor function. The line `balanceOf[0x1052ed7429d00a45fff1dbc52c2a28e398fe81db] = totalSupply;` can cause an integer overflow.

In Solidity, the uint256 type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When the value of a uint256 variable reaches its maximum value (2^256 - 1) and an operation causes it to increase further, it wraps around to 0. This is known as an integer overflow.

In the constructor function, the totalSupply is set to 200000000000000000000000000, and then the entire supply is transferred to the address 0x1052ed7EE29D00A45FF1dbc52C2A28E398FE81DB. If the balanceOf mapping for this address was previously non-zero, the addition of the totalSupply would cause an integer overflow, resulting in an incorrect balance value.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate",555,301,12.368740558624268
85,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the `CustomToken()` constructor function. The issue is that the `totalSupply` is set to a very large number, and then the `balanceOf` mapping is updated with this value for the address `0x1052ed7429d00a45fff1dbc52c2a28e398fe81db`.

The problem arises when the `balanceOf` mapping is accessed later in the code. Since the `balanceOf` mapping is a `mapping` data structure in Solidity, it does not have a default value for non-existent keys. When accessing a non-existent key, the default value is zero.

If the `balanceOf` mapping is accessed for an address that has not been assigned a balance yet, the value will be zero. This can lead to an integer underflow when subtracting from the balance, as the code may attempt to subtract a positive value from zero, resulting in a negative balance.

To fix this vulnerability, you can initialize the `balanceOf` mapping with a default value of zero for all addresses, or you can check if the address exists in the mapping before performing any operations on the balance.",636,292,11.984136581420898
86,arithmetic," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the operations that perform arithmetic on the `count` variable without checking for overflow or underflow conditions. In Solidity, when an overflow or underflow occurs, the result wraps around the maximum or minimum value of the type, which can lead to unexpected and potentially exploitable behavior.

In this case, the vulnerable lines are:

- Line 18: `count += input;`
- Line 24: `count *= input;`
- Line 30: `count -= input;`
- Line 36: `uint res = count + input;`
- Line 42: `uint res = count * input;`
- Line 48: `uint res = count - input;`

These lines can cause integer overflow or underflow if the input value is large enough. To mitigate this vulnerability, you can use Solidity's built-in overflow and underflow protection by importing the `SafeMath` library from OpenZeppelin Contracts or by using the `SafeMath` library from the `solidity-bignumber` package.",972,261,10.812418699264526

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the `transfer` function, specifically in the lines where the sender's balance is decremented and the receiver's balance is incremented.

In Solidity version 0.4.18, the `uint` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When subtracting `_value` from `balances[msg.sender]`, if the sender's balance is less than `_value`, the result will wrap around to a very large number due to the lack of overflow checks. This can lead to an incorrect balance update and potentially allow the sender to transfer more tokens than they actually have.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflow and underflow. You can also upgrade to a newer Solidity version (0.8.x or above) where overflow checks are automatically performed for unsigned integer operations.",814,217,9.00331163406372

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the `CustomToken()` constructor function. The line `balanceOf[0x1052ed7429d00a45fff1dbc52c2a28e398fe81db] = totalSupply;` can cause an integer overflow.

In Solidity, the `uint256` type is an unsigned integer with a maximum value of 2^256 - 1. When you try to assign a value that exceeds this maximum value, it will wrap around to 0, causing an integer overflow. In this case, the `totalSupply` is set to 200000000000000000000000000, which is a very large number but still within the range of `uint256`. However, if the `totalSupply` were to be increased further, it could cause an integer overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflows and underflows. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath in the `CustomToken` contract:

The vulnerability lies in the `add` function of the `Overflow` contract. When the `value` parameter is added to `sellerBalance`, there is no check to ensure that the result does not overflow the maximum value of a uint type. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploitation by attackers.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin, which provides arithmetic operations with built-in overflow checks. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath to fix the vulnerability:

By using SafeMath, the `add` function will now check for overflow and revert the transaction if an overflow occurs, preventing any potential exploitation.",572,299,12.286152362823486
90,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the line 18 of the IntegerOverflowAdd contract:

balanceOf[_to] += _value;

This line does not check for overflow when adding the value to the recipient's balance. If the recipient's balance plus the value to be transferred exceeds the maximum value of a uint256 (2^256 - 1), it will wrap around to 0, leading to an incorrect balance and potentially allowing the attacker to drain funds from the contract.

The vulnerability lies in the use of block.number and block.coinbase for generating randomness. Block.number is predictable and can be manipulated by miners, and block.coinbase is also predictable as it is the address of the miner who mined the block. This makes the randomness used in the chooseWinner function predictable and potentially exploitable by a miner or a user with enough knowledge and resources.

Additionally, the use of block.difficulty as a seed for randomness is also not recommended, as it can be influenced by miners and is not a truly random value.

To fix this vulnerability, a more secure source of randomness should be used, such as the OPCODE_RANDOM opcode in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) or an off-chain randomness provider like Chainlink VRF.",3141,204,9.371925830841064

The `block.blockhash(block.number - 1)` function returns the hash of the previous block, which is predictable and can be known by miners or anyone with access to the blockchain. The `now` variable is the current timestamp, which is also predictable and can be influenced by miners. Combining these two predictable values and hashing them with `keccak256` does not provide a secure source of randomness.

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (in this case, the `msg.sender`) and sending Ether to it before updating the balance of the `acc` struct. This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `Collect` function before the balance update is completed, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the balance update should be done before the external call, and the contract should use the `transfer` or `send` function instead of `call.value` to send Ether to the external contract.",1427,175,7.436326026916504
117,reentrancy," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function, specifically in line 24, where the contract sends Ether to the caller before updating the sender's balance. This allows a malicious contract to call the `transfer` function during the execution of `withdrawBalance`, potentially draining funds from the contract.",859,90,3.857814311981201
118,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function, specifically in line 24:

```solidity

}
```

This line of code allows the `msg.sender` to call the `withdrawBalance` function again before the state of the contract is updated, which can lead to the reentrancy attack. The attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the `withdrawBalance` function and then calls another function in the `withdrawBalance` function, effectively draining the funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the state before calling external contracts or use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which ensures that all state changes are made before any external calls are made.",799,214,8.923642635345459

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (the `msg.sender`) and sending Ether to it before updating the balance of the sender. This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `CashOut` function before the balance update is completed, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance of the sender before sending Ether to the external contract. This can be done by moving the line `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;` before the line `if(msgEE.call.value(_am)())`.

Here's the updated `CashOut` function:

```solidity
function CashOut(uint _am)
{
    if(_am<=balances[msg.sender])
    {
        balances[msg.sender]-=_am;

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (the msg.sender) and sending Ether to it before updating the balances. If the external contract is malicious and has a fallback function that calls back into the `Collect` function of the `PRIVATE_ETH_CELL` contract, it can potentially withdraw more funds than it should, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balances before sending Ether to the external contract. Here's an example of how to fix the vulnerability:

The vulnerability lies in line 29:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. In this case, the Collect function is vulnerable to reentrancy because it allows the external contract to call the Put function before the balance is deducted.

An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the Collect function and then calls the Put function within the malicious contract. This would result in the balance being increased before it is deducted, effectively stealing funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern, where all state changes are made before any external calls are made. In this case, the balance should be deducted before the external call is made in the Collect function.",1431,209,8.808362245559692

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (the msg.sender) and sending Ether to it before updating the balance of the msg.sender. This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `Collect` function before the balance update is completed, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance of the msg.sender before calling the external contract. Here's an updated version of the `Collect` function:

126,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract. The issue is that the contract allows external calls to be made before the state of the contract is updated. In this case, the `userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;` line is executed after the external call, which means that if the external call is a reentrant call, it can call `withdrawBalance` again before the balance is updated to 0. This can lead to multiple withdrawals of the same funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the state before making external calls, or use checks-effects-interactions pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks.",739,176,7.309481859207153
127,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `isSaleFinished()` function of the `TimedCrowdsale` contract, which relies on the `block.timestamp` to determine if the sale is finished.

128,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation due to the reliance on block.timestamp for both the payOut function and the randomGen function.

129,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `resetInvestment` function, where the condition `if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp+ONE_MINUTE) throw;` is used to prevent the reset from happening too soon after the last investment. However, miners have the ability to manipulate the timestamp within a certain range, which could allow an attacker to bypass this condition by mining a block with a timestamp that is just over the `lastInvestmentTimestamp + ONE_MINUTE`. This would enable the attacker to call `resetInvestment` and potentially steal the jackpot.",1179,145,6.172948122024536
130,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same lines as the previous code:

- Line 18: `require(now!= pastBlockTime);`
- Line 20: `pastBlockTime = now;`

These lines ensure that only one transaction per block can successfully execute the `if(now % 15 == 0)` condition, which transfers the contract's balance to the sender. However, miners have the ability to manipulate the timestamp of a block within a certain range. This means that a miner could potentially delay the execution of the contract's function by a few seconds or minutes, allowing multiple transactions to pass the `require(now!= pastBlockTime)` check and execute the `if(now % 15 == 0)` condition.

This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who wants to drain the contract's balance by sending multiple transactions with the required value (10 ether) and manipulating the block timestamp to ensure that the `if(now % 15 == 0)` condition is met multiple times.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should not rely solely on the block timestamp to determine the eligibility of a transaction. Instead, it could use a more secure method to generate random numbers or rely on external oracles to provide accurate time information.",751,301,12.36536169052124
131,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same line as the first contract:

var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;

An attacker with enough hash power could influence the block timestamps to control the outcome of the random number generation, potentially winning the lottery multiple times or avoiding paying fees.",965,109,4.666423320770264
132,short addresses," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to short address attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `sendCoin` function handles the `to` address. The `to` address is passed as a parameter without type checking or validation, which can lead to short address attacks if an attacker uses a short address that is a prefix of a legitimate address. This can result in the transfer of tokens to an unintended recipient.",958,94,4.049214601516724
133,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. An attacker can repeatedly call the `addCreditors` function to fill the `creditorAddresses` array until it reaches a length greater than 1500. Once this happens, the `emptyCreditors` function will be triggered, which clears the `creditorAddresses` array and sets the `win` variable to true. This can be exploited to disrupt the normal operation of the contract by repeatedly adding and removing creditors, potentially causing a DoS condition if the contract is expected to maintain a certain state or perform specific actions based on the `creditorAddresses` array.",923,158,6.642974138259888
134,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles the dynamic array `array`. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the array is being resized:

Line 19: `if(numElements == array.length)`
Line 20: `array.length += 1;`

When the `insertNnumbers` function is called with a large number of elements to insert, the contract will continuously resize the array, which is an expensive operation. This can lead to a DoS attack by consuming all available gas, preventing other transactions from being processed.

Additionally, the `clearDOS` function can also be exploited by calling it with a large number of elements to clear, which would also consume a significant amount of gas and potentially lead to a DoS attack.

To mitigate this vulnerability, consider using a fixed-size array or a more efficient data structure, and ensure that the contract does not allow for excessive gas consumption by limiting the number of elements that can be inserted or cleared at once.",1050,250,10.386922121047974
135,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the reset of the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays when a new credit cycle starts.

```solidity
require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));
```

This line attempts to send Ether to each address in the `refundAddresses` array. If any of these addresses fail to accept the Ether (e.g., due to insufficient gas, or the address being a contract that reverts the transaction), the entire transaction will fail and roll back all state changes, including the refunds sent to other addresses.

137,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function of the `DosOneFunc` contract. An attacker can repeatedly call this function, causing the `listAddresses` array to fill up. Once the array reaches its maximum size (1500 in this case), the function will clear the array, but this does not prevent further calls to the function. This can lead to a DoS attack by continuously filling and clearing the array, consuming resources and potentially preventing legitimate calls to the contract.",768,132,5.550759553909302

The vulnerability lies in the same line 23: require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));

This line of code attempts to send the currentBid amount to the currentFrontrunner. If the currentFrontrunner is a contract or a wallet that does not have enough Ether to cover the transaction, the transaction will fail, causing the bid function to revert. This will result in a denial of service as the bid will not be processed, and the auction will not be able to accept new bids.",758,141,5.8989808559417725
