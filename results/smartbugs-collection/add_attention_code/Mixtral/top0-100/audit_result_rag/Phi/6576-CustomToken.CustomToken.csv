The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. Although it is not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, the vulnerability is common in Solidity contracts that use `tx.origin` to validate callers. This can lead to access control bypasses, as attackers can use lower-level calls to execute functions as if they were the original sender.",1049,93,4.042419672012329
12,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being updated with the `totalSupply` amount for the address `0x178f97a55b02eead22b895e6525de97689dd05e9` before the `Transfer` event is emitted. This can lead to an issue where the `Transfer` event is not emitted for the initial supply transfer, which can cause problems with event tracking and logging.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` contract does not have any access control mechanisms in place, which means that any user can call the `CustomToken()` constructor and potentially reinitialize the contract with a new token supply. This can lead to loss of funds and other unintended consequences.

To fix this vulnerability, the `CustomToken()` constructor should be made private to prevent external calls, and the `Transfer` event should be emitted before updating the `balanceOf` mapping. Also, access control mechanisms should be implemented to restrict who can call the constructor.",710,266,10.975481271743774

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `addPayout` function, where the `creator` address is not checked before sending Ether to the `Participant` addresses. This means that any user can call the `addPayout` function and send Ether to the `Participant` addresses, potentially draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `addPayout` function should be modified to include a modifier that checks if the caller is the `creator` before executing the function. This can be done by adding a `creatorOnly` modifier and using it in the `addPayout` function, like this:

```solidity
modifier creatorOnly {
    require(msg.sender == creator);
    _;
}

function addPayout(uint _fee) creatorOnly private {
    //...
}

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `migrateTo` function, which allows the creator of the contract to transfer the entire balance of the contract to any address they choose. This could potentially lead to the loss of funds if the creator's address is compromised or if they are malicious.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` contract inherits from the `BaseToken` contract, which has a public `balanceOf` mapping. This means that anyone can access the balance of any address, which could lead to privacy issues and potential manipulation of the token's balances.",912,142,5.985590219497681
15,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being accessed and modified before the contract is fully deployed and before the constructor has finished executing. This can lead to an incorrect initial balance being set for the owner, which is a form of reentrancy attack.

In the `CustomToken` constructor, the `balanceOf` mapping is accessed with the owner's address (`0x178f97a55b02eead22b895e6525de97689dd05e9`) before the constructor has finished executing. This can lead to a situation where the balance is not set correctly, as the contract is not fully deployed yet.

To fix this issue, the `CustomToken` constructor should be modified to ensure that the `balanceOf` mapping is accessed and modified only after the constructor has finished executing. This can be achieved by using a separate function to set the initial balance, which is called after the constructor has finished executing.

Here's an updated version of the `CustomToken` contract:

16,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `set` function, which allows anyone to modify the `map` array by providing a `key` and a `value`.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the access control issue in the `PopBonusCode` function. The condition `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length);` is always true since array lengths are unsigned and cannot be negative. This means that the `PopBonusCode` function can be called without any restrictions, potentially leading to an underflow if the bonusCodes array is empty.",946,89,3.8501317501068115
19,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being updated with the `totalSupply` before the constructor function has finished executing. This can lead to a situation where the `balanceOf` mapping is accessible and modifiable by other contracts or functions before the contract is fully initialized, potentially leading to an incorrect or insecure state.

In Solidity, the constructor function is executed before the contract is deployed, and the state variables are not yet fully initialized. In this case, the `balanceOf` mapping is being updated with the `totalSupply` value before the contract is fully deployed. This can lead to a situation where the `balanceOf` mapping is accessible and modifiable by other contracts or functions before the contract is fully initialized, potentially leading to an incorrect or insecure state.

To fix this issue, the `CustomToken` constructor should be modified to ensure that the `balanceOf` mapping is only updated after the contract is fully deployed and initialized. This can be achieved by using a separate function to update the `balanceOf` mapping after the constructor function has finished executing.",713,267,11.047069549560547
20,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `migrateTo` function, which allows the `creator` of the wallet to transfer the entire balance to any address they want. Since the `creator` is set in the `initWallet` function and is not changed afterwards, any user who calls `initWallet` can set themselves as the `creator`. This means they can then call `migrateTo` to transfer the entire balance to any address, effectively stealing the funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `creator` should be set to a specific address (e.g., the owner of the contract) and not be changeable by any user. Additionally, the `migrateTo` function should be restricted to only the `creator` or an authorized address.",939,186,7.771408319473267
21,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the access control issue present in the `sendTo` function of the `MyContract` contract. The vulnerability lies in line 20: `require(tx.origin == owner);`. This line uses `tx.origin` to check if the caller of the function is the owner of the contract. However, `tx.origin` can be easily spoofed by malicious actors, allowing them to bypass the access control check and call the `sendTo` function as if they were the owner.

In addition, the contract uses an outdated version of Solidity (0.4.24), which is no longer supported and may contain other vulnerabilities. It is recommended to update the contract to a more recent version of Solidity and use a more secure method for access control, such as using a modifier or implementing a role-based access control system.",657,196,8.136482238769531
22,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `refund` function, which uses `msg.sender.transfer(balances[msg.sender]);` to send the balance back to the caller. This can be exploited by an attacker who is not the owner of the contract but has some funds in the contract.

An attacker can create a contract and call the `deposit` function to deposit some funds into the Wallet contract. Then, the attacker can call the `refund` function, which will send the deposited funds back to the attacker's contract. This is because the `refund` function does not check if the caller is the owner of the contract, allowing anyone to withdraw funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `refund` function should be modified to only allow the owner of the contract to call it, similar to the `migrateTo` function. This can be done by adding a modifier that checks if the caller is the owner and using it in the `refund` function.",971,236,9.799315214157104
23,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the access control issue present in the `CustomToken` contract. The vulnerability lies in the constructor of the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the line where the `Transfer` event is emitted:

```solidity
Transfer(address(0), 0x178f97a55b02eead22b895e6525de97689dd05e9, totalSupply);
```

This line emits a `Transfer` event, which is supposed to indicate a transfer of tokens from one account to another. However, in this case, it is emitting a transfer from the zero address (`address(0)`) to the contract's owner (`0x178f97a55b02eead22b895e6525de97689dd05e9`). This is misleading and can be considered a vulnerability because it may give the impression that tokens are being transferred when they are not.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` contract inherits from the `BaseToken` contract, which contains a `Transfer` event. This event is not properly secured, as it can be emitted by any function in the `CustomToken` contract, potentially leading to unautrightful token",604,301,12.365037441253662
24,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `changeOwner` function in the `Unprotected` contract. This function allows anyone to change the owner of the contract by calling it with the new owner's address as an argument. Since the `changeOwner` function is public and does not have any access control checks, it can be exploited by any user to change the ownership of the contract.

This can lead to various issues, such as unauthorized access to sensitive data, manipulation of contract logic, or even theft of funds if the contract holds any. To fix this vulnerability, the `changeOwner` function should be modified to include access control checks, ensuring that only the current owner or a designated authority can change the ownership of the contract.",708,170,7.11889123916626

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in both the `withdraw` function and the fallback function. The `delegatecall` is used to call a function in the `fibonacciLibrary` contract, which could potentially be controlled by an attacker. If the attacker can deploy a malicious contract with the same selector as `setFibonacci` and deploy it to the same address as `fibonacciLibrary`, they could manipulate the `calculatedFibNumber` value.

The send function does not revert the transaction if the transfer fails, and it does not provide any error information. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds if the transfer fails for some reason.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the transfer or transferFrom functions provided by the ERC20 token standard, which will revert the transaction if the transfer fails and provide error information.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the operations that perform addition, multiplication, and subtraction on the `count` variable, which is of type `uint256`. In Solidity, `uint256` is an unsigned integer type that can lead to overflow and underflow issues when arithmetic operations exceed the maximum or minimum values that can be represented by this type.

The vulnerable lines in the code are:

- Line 18: `count += input;`
- Line 24: `count *= input;`
- Line 30: `count -= input;`
- Line 36: `uint res = count + input;`

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the `transfer` function, specifically in the lines where the sender's balance is decremented and the receiver's balance is incremented.

In Solidity version 0.4.18, the `uint` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When subtracting `_value` from `balances[msg.sender]`, if the sender's balance is less than `_value`, the result will wrap around to a very large number due to the lack of overflow checks. This can lead to an incorrect balance update and potentially allow the sender to transfer more tokens than they actually have.

In Solidity, the `mapping` data structure is initialized with a default value of 0. When assigning the `totalSupply` to the `balanceOf` of the first account, the value of `totalSupply` is added to the existing value of `balanceOf[0x178f97a55b02eead22b895e6525de97689dd05e9]`. Since the initial value of `balanceOf` is 0, this operation should not cause an overflow. However, if the `totalSupply` were to be set to a value that, when added to the existing balance, exceeds the maximum value of a uint256, an overflow would occur.

The vulnerability lies in the use of block.number and block.coinbase for generating randomness. Block.number is predictable and can be manipulated by miners, and block.coinbase is also predictable as it is the address of the miner who mined the block. This makes the randomness in the chooseWinner function predictable and can be exploited by a malicious user.

Additionally, the use of block.difficulty as a seed for randomness is also not secure, as miners can influence the difficulty of the block they mine, which can affect the randomness generated.

To fix this vulnerability, a more secure source of randomness should be used, such as the Ethereum RNG (Random Number Generator) or a decentralized oracle service that provides randomness from multiple sources.",3148,193,8.928490161895752
93,bad randomness," YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the randomness generation function `rand(uint max)`. The issue is that the function uses the block hash of the previous block to generate a pseudo-random number. However, block hashes are not truly random and can be influenced by miners. This means that a miner with enough computational power could potentially predict the block hash and thus the outcome of the `rand(uint max)` function. This predictability can be exploited by a malicious user to manipulate the outcome of the function, which is supposed to be unpredictable.

Additionally, the use of a constant factor in the `rand(uint max)` function can also be considered a vulnerability. The constant factor is used to scale the block hash and then modulo it with the maximum value to get a random number. However, this does not guarantee true randomness, as the block hash is not truly random.

The `block.blockhash(block.number - 1)` function returns the hash of the previous block, which is predictable and can be known by miners or anyone with access to the blockchain data. The `now` variable is also predictable as it represents the current timestamp. Combining these two predictable values and hashing them with `keccak256` does not provide a secure source of randomness.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in line 54, where the contract allows an external call to be made before the state changes are finalized:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

In this line, the contract sends `_am` ether to the `msg.sender` and then checks if the call was successful. However, if the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract with a fallback function designed to reenter the contract, it can call the `Collect` function again before the state changes are finalized. This can lead to multiple withdrawals of funds from the contract, potentially draining the entire balance.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the state before making the external call, or use a pattern like checks-effects-interactions to ensure that the state is updated before any external calls are made.",1596,209,8.893458604812622
112,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawAll` function of the `ReentrancyDAO` contract. The issue is the same as in the first example you provided: the contract allows external calls to be made before the state of the contract is updated.

In the `withdrawAll` function, the contract sends Ether to the `msg.sender` before updating the `credit` mapping. This means that if the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract that has a fallback function designed to call back into the `withdrawAll` function, it can potentially withdraw more Ether than it is entitled to.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the `credit` mapping before sending Ether to the `msg.sender`. Here's an example of how the `withdrawAll` function can be modified to prevent the reentrancy attack:

```solidity
function withdrawAll() public {
    uint oCredit = credit[msg.sender];
    if (oCredit > 0) {
        credit[msg.sender] = 0;

This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `Collect` function before the balance update is completed, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the balance update should be done before the external call, and the contract should use the `transfer` or `send` function instead of `call.value` to send Ether to the external contract.",1434,175,7.463493347167969

At this point, the caller's code is executed, and it can call the `transfer` function. If the `transfer` function is called by an untrusted contract, it can lead to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests that you should first perform all checks and effects (state changes) before interacting with external contracts. In this case, you should set the user's balance to zero before making the external call.

The issue is that the contract allows external calls to be made before the state of the contract is updated, which can lead to reentrancy attacks.

In the `withdrawBalance` function, the contract sends the user's balance to the `msg.sender` before updating the user's balance to 0. This means that if the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract, it can call the `withdrawBalance` function again before the balance is updated, leading to multiple withdrawals.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the user's balance before sending the funds. Here's an example of a secure implementation:

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `resetInvestment` function, where the condition `if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp+ONE_MINUTE) throw;` is used to prevent the reset from happening too soon after the last investment. However, miners have the ability to manipulate the timestamp within a certain range, which could allow an attacker to bypass this condition by mining a block with a timestamp that is just over the `lastInvestmentTimestamp + ONE_MINUTE`.

The issue is that the contract relies on the current time (now) to determine when to transfer funds to the sender. Miners have some leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, which can be manipulated to a certain extent. This means that a malicious miner could potentially manipulate the block timestamp to trigger the transfer condition earlier or later than intended.

132,short addresses," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to short address attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `sendCoin` function handles the `to` address parameter. In Solidity, addresses are 20 bytes long, but when passed as arguments to functions, they can be padded with zeros. If an attacker uses a short address (less than 20 bytes), the contract might interpret it as a different address, leading to funds being sent to an unintended recipient.

To fix this issue, the `sendCoin` function should explicitly check the length of the `to` address and reject any short addresses:

```solidity
function sendCoin(address to, uint amount) returns(bool sufficient) {
    if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) return false;
    if (to.length!= 20) return false;
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. An attacker can repeatedly call the `addCreditors` function to fill the `creditorAddresses` array until it reaches a length of 1500. Once this threshold is reached, the `emptyCreditors` function will be triggered, which clears the entire `creditorAddresses` array. This can be done repeatedly, causing the contract to be unable to process legitimate transactions or functions that rely on the `creditorAddresses` array, effectively denying service to legitimate users.",930,138,5.834364414215088

The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the contract attempts to dynamically resize the `array` if `numElements` reaches the current length of the `array`.

In Solidity, arrays are fixed-size data structures, and their size cannot be changed once they are initialized. The line `array.length += 1;` is attempting to change the size of the array, which is not allowed and will result in a runtime error. This error will cause the transaction to revert, effectively denying service to the user who initiated the transaction.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should be modified to allocate enough space for the `array` before inserting elements into it. This can be done by initializing the `array` with a fixed size or by using a dynamic array with a predefined maximum size.",1057,201,8.412994146347046
135,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the reset of the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays when a new credit cycle starts.

This line attempts to send Ether to each address in the `refundAddresses` array. If any of the addresses in the array is a contract that has a fallback function that consumes a significant amount of gas or gets stuck in an infinite loop, the transaction will fail, and the entire `refundAll` function will revert. This will result in a denial of service, as the funds will be stuck in the contract and cannot be refunded.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` contract inherits from the `BaseToken` contract, which has a `Transfer` event. If the `CustomToken` contract is used in conjunction with the `Refund` contract, it could potentially lead to a denial of service if the `Transfer` event is triggered during the execution of the `refundAll` function.",957,252,10.506694793701172
137,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function of the `DosOneFunc` contract. An attacker can repeatedly call this function, causing the contract to continuously fill the `listAddresses` array with the attacker's address. This can lead to the contract consuming a significant amount of gas and potentially exhausting the blockchain's resources, resulting in a Denial of Service attack.

In a DoS attack, the attacker can prevent legitimate users from interacting with the contract by consuming the available gas and resources, effectively taking the contract offline. This can have severe consequences, as smart contracts are immutable and cannot be easily fixed or updated once deployed.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should implement rate limiting or other mechanisms to prevent an attacker from repeatedly calling the `ifillArray` function and consuming excessive resources.",775,215,8.943040132522583
