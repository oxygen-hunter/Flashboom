11,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function in the `MultiOwnable` contract. The issue is that the `newOwner` function allows any user to become an owner of the contract without proper authorization checks.

In the `newOwner` function, the `require` statement checks if the `_owner` address is not zero, but it does not verify if the caller has the necessary permissions to add a new owner. This means that any user can call the `newOwner` function and add themselves or another address as an owner, which can lead to unautrightful control over the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `newOwner` function should be modified to include an authorization check, ensuring that only the root owner or another authorized user can add new owners. This can be achieved by adding an `onlyOwner` modifier to the `newOwner` function, similar to the `deleteOwner` function.",1087,209,8.806107759475708
12,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, which inherits from the `BaseToken` contract. The `CustomToken` constructor function is marked as `public`, which means it can be called by any external account. However, the function `transfer` in the `BaseToken` contract, which is responsible for transferring tokens, is not marked as `onlyowner` or restricted in any way. This means that any external account can call the `transfer` function and potentially manipulate the token balances.

To fix this vulnerability, the `transfer` function in the `BaseToken` contract should be marked with an access control modifier like `onlyowner` to ensure that only the owner or authorized accounts can call it.",748,174,7.262727499008179

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `addPayout` function, where the `pyramidMultiplier` is set to a new value based on the number of participants. This function is not marked as `onlyowner`, which means any user can call it and change the `pyramidMultiplier` value. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploitation by malicious actors.

To fix this vulnerability, the `addPayout` function should be marked as `onlyowner` to ensure that only the contract owner can call it and modify the `pyramidMultiplier` value.",3409,144,6.888662576675415

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function, specifically in line 21:

require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);

This line allows any user to withdraw their balance, which is correct. However, the issue arises in the next line:

msg.sender.transfer(amount);

This line allows the user to transfer their balance to any address they want, which is not a proper access control mechanism. A better approach would be to use the `transferFrom` function from the `ERC20` interface, which would require the user to approve the contract to spend their tokens.

Additionally, the `migrateTo` function in the `Wallet` contract allows the creator to transfer the entire balance to any address. This could be exploited if the creator's address is compromised.

To fix these issues, you should implement proper access control mechanisms, such as using the `ERC20` interface for token transfers and adding checks to ensure that only authorized users can perform certain actions.",950,248,10.304283142089844
15,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being updated with the `totalSupply` before the constructor has finished executing. This can lead to a situation where the `balanceOf` mapping is accessible and modifiable by other contracts or functions before the contract is fully initialized, potentially leading to an incorrect state or unintended behavior.

To fix this vulnerability, the `balanceOf` mapping should be updated after the constructor has finished executing. This can be achieved by moving the `balanceOf` update statement after the constructor's body:

```solidity

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `migrateTo` function, which allows the `creator` of the contract to transfer the entire balance of the contract to any address they choose. Since the `creator` is set in the `initWallet` function and is not changed afterwards, any user who calls `initWallet` can set themselves as the `creator`. This means they can then call `migrateTo` to transfer all the funds to another address, effectively draining the contract's funds.",977,126,5.355736255645752

However, `tx.origin` can be easily spoofed by malicious actors, allowing them to bypass the access control check and call the `sendTo` function as if they were the owner.

In addition, the contract uses an outdated version of Solidity (0.4.24), which is no longer supported and may contain other vulnerabilities. It is recommended to update the contract to a more recent version of Solidity and use a more secure method for access control, such as using a modifier or implementing a role-based access control system.",695,196,8.153120279312134

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in both the `withdraw` function and the fallback function. The `delegatecall` allows the contract to execute code in the context of another contract, which can lead to access control issues if not properly managed. In this case, the `withdraw` function and the fallback function are allowing any contract to call the `FibonacciLib` functions, which could lead to unauthorized access to the `calculatedFibNumber` state variable.

To fix this vulnerability, you should remove the `delegatecall` from both the `withdraw` function and the fallback function, and instead use direct function calls to the `FibonacciLib` contract.

This line uses the low-level `call.value` function to send Ether and execute arbitrary code on the `_target` address. The issue is that the return value of this function is not checked, which means that if the call fails, the contract will continue to execute without reverting the transaction.

The vulnerability lies in the `run` function of the `IntegerOverflowMultiTxOneFuncFeasible` contract. Specifically, the line `count -= input;` can cause an integer underflow if the `input` is greater than the current value of `count`. In Solidity version 0.4.23, there is no built-in overflow or underflow checking, which makes the contract susceptible to this issue.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the `run` function with a large `input` value, causing the `count` to underflow and potentially leading to unexpected behavior or even loss of funds.",681,156,6.506701231002808
86,arithmetic," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. This is because it uses Solidity version 0.4.23, which does not have built-in overflow checks. The operations in the functions `overflowaddtostate`, `overflowmultostate`, `underflowtostate`, `overflowlocalonly`, `overflowmulocalonly`, and `underflowlocalonly` can lead to integer overflow and underflow issues.",1017,97,4.181390047073364

```solidity
require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
```

In Solidity, the `uint` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When subtracting `_value` from `balances[msg.sender]`, if the result is less than zero, it will wrap around to a very large positive number due to the nature of unsigned integer arithmetic. This can lead to an incorrect balance and potentially allow the attacker to drain funds from the contract.",859,168,7.066357612609863
88,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the `CustomToken()` constructor function. The line `balanceOf[0x5ebc4B61A0E0187d9a72Da21bfb8b45F519cb530] = totalSupply;` is vulnerable to integer overflow.

In Solidity, when dealing with fixed-point numbers (like `uint256`), the number of decimals is taken into account when performing arithmetic operations. In this case, the `decimals` variable is set to 4, which means that the actual value of `totalSupply` is `totalSupply / (10 ** decimals)`.

When assigning `totalSupply` to the `balanceOf` mapping, the value is divided by `10 ** decimals`, which can result in an integer overflow if the actual value of `totalSupply` is too large. This can lead to incorrect balances and potentially allow for theft or denial of service.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflows and underflows.",587,285,11.742304801940918
89,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to arithmetic overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `add` function of the `Overflow` contract. When the `value` being added to `sellerBalance` is large enough, it can cause an overflow, which means the result will wrap around and become a smaller number than expected. This can lead to incorrect balances and potentially allow for exploits where an attacker can manipulate the contract's state.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin or similar libraries that provide safe arithmetic operations. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath to fix the vulnerability:

93,bad randomness," YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the randomness generation function `rand(uint max)` which is used to determine which entry gets paid. The function uses the block hash of the last block to generate a pseudo-random number. However, miners have some control over the block hash, and they can influence the outcome of the `rand` function by manipulating the nonce of the block. This could potentially allow a miner to favor their own entry or entries, thus compromising the fairness of the payout mechanism.

Additionally, the contract does not have a mechanism to prevent a single address from winning multiple times in a row, which could lead to a situation where one user receives multiple payouts before others have received any. This could be considered unfair and could discourage users from participating in the game.

To mitigate these issues, the contract could use a more secure source of randomness, such as an oracle that provides a random number from a trusted source, or implement a more complex algorithm that ensures a fair distribution of payouts over time.",3454,235,10.745888710021973

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `supportsToken()` function within the `attack` contract. When the `supportsToken()` function is called, it checks if `hasBeenCalled` is false. If it is, it sets `hasBeenCalled` to true and calls the `airDrop()` function of the `ModifierEntrancy` contract. However, the `airDrop()` function does not have any internal calls to the `attack` contract or any other contract that could potentially call back into the `attack` contract.

In this specific case, the reentrancy vulnerability is not directly exploitable due to the absence of internal calls in the `airDrop()` function. However, if the `airDrop()` function had any internal calls to the `attack` contract or other contracts that could call back into the `attack` contract, it would be vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance of the sender before sending Ether to the external contract. This can be done by moving the line `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;` before the external call.",1340,172,7.31937837600708

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in line 54, where the contract allows an external call to be made before the state changes are finalized:

The vulnerability lies in line 40:

```solidity

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (msg.sender) and sending Ether to it before updating the balance of the sender. This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `CashOut` function before the balance update is completed, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance of the sender before sending Ether to the external contract. Here's an updated version of the `CashOut` function:

```solidity
function CashOut(uint _am)
    public

By updating the balance first and then sending Ether, the contract is no longer vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.",1340,296,12.335620641708374
125,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 54:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (in this case, the msg.sender) and sending Ether to it before updating the balance of the msg.sender. This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `Collect` function before the balance update is completed, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance of the msg.sender before calling the external contract. Here's an example of how to fix the vulnerability:

```solidity
function Collect(uint _am)
    public
    payable
    {
        if(balances[msg.sender]>=MinSum && balances[msgEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE",1532,301,12.551411390304565
126,reentrancy," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract. The issue is that the contract allows external calls to be made before the state of the contract is updated. In this case, the `userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;` line is executed after the external call, which means that if the external call is a reentrant call, it can withdraw the balance again before the balance is set to zero.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the state before making any external calls. Here's an example of how the `withdrawBalance` function can be modified to prevent reentrancy attacks:

```solidity
function withdrawBalance() public {
    uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
    userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""");
    require(success);
}
```

By updating the `userBalances[msg.sender]` before the external call, the contract ensures that the balance is set to zero before any external calls are made, preventing reentrancy attacks.",784,290,11.97051739692688
127,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `isSaleFinished()` function of the `TimedCrowdsale` contract, which relies on the `block.timestamp` to determine if the sale is finished. As mentioned earlier, the `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners to some extent, which can lead to incorrect results for time-based logic in smart contracts.",665,97,4.115750789642334
128,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation due to the reliance on block.timestamp for both the payOut function and the randomGen function. This can be exploited by miners to manipulate the reported time, affecting the contract's behavior.",944,59,2.6227853298187256
129,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the resetInvestment function, specifically in the line:

if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp+ONE_MINUTE) throw;

This line checks if the current block timestamp is at least one minute after the last investment timestamp before allowing the resetInvestment function to proceed. However, as mentioned in the provided explanation, the block.timestamp can be manipulated by miners to some extent. An attacker could potentially mine a block with a timestamp that is just under one minute after the lastInvestmentTimestamp, thus bypassing the time check and triggering the resetInvestment function.

This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to drain the funds from the Governmental contract by repeatedly calling the resetInvestment function within a short time frame, causing the jackpot to be sent to the lastInvestor and the owner's balance to be reduced by 1 ether.",1224,219,9.203083753585815
130,time manipulation," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same lines as the original code you provided:

1. Line 18: `require(now!= pastBlockTime);`
2. Line 20: `pastBlockTime = now;`

These lines ensure that only one transaction per block can transfer the balance to the sender. However, miners have some leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, which can be manipulated to a certain extent. This means that a miner could potentially delay the block confirmation to manipulate the timing of the transfer.

In a scenario where a malicious miner wants to prevent a transfer from happening, they could delay the block confirmation, causing the `now` value to be different from the `pastBlockTime` and thus preventing the transfer. Conversely, if a miner wants to make the transfer happen earlier, they could speed up the block confirmation, causing the `now` value to be the same as the `pastBlockTime` and triggering the transfer.

This vulnerability can be exploited by miners with a significant amount of hash power, and it can lead to unexpected behavior in the contract. To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to use block.timestamp with caution and avoid relying on it for critical logic in smart contracts.",796,300,12.394561290740967
131,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same line as the first contract:

var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;

This line uses block.timestamp to generate a random number, which can be manipulated by miners. An attacker with enough hash power could influence the block timestamps to control the outcome of the random number generation, potentially winning the lottery multiple times or avoiding paying fees.",1010,109,4.676079988479614

133,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. This function can be exploited by repeatedly calling it to keep the `creditorAddresses` array at a length of 1500 or more, which triggers the line `creditorAddresses = new address[](0);`. This action resets the `creditorAddresses` array to an empty array, potentially causing the contract to behave unexpectedly or even become unusable if the `win` state is relied upon by other parts of the contract or external contracts.",968,133,5.649003028869629
134,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the contract attempts to dynamically resize the `array` if `numElements` is equal to `array.length`.

In Solidity, arrays are fixed-size data structures, and their size cannot be changed once they are initialized. The line `array.length += 1;` is attempting to change the size of the array, which is not allowed and will result in a runtime error. This error can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service by repeatedly calling the `insertNnumbers` function with a large number of elements, causing the contract to fail and potentially become unresponsive.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should be modified to use a dynamic array type, such as `uint[]`, which allows for dynamic resizing. Alternatively, the contract could be designed to allocate a fixed-size array with a maximum capacity and handle the case when the array is full by rejecting the transaction or returning an error.",1095,234,9.768282175064087
135,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the reset of the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays when a new credit cycle starts. This can be exploited by repeatedly calling the `lendGovernmentMoney` function, which resets the arrays and potentially drains the contract's balance by sending funds to the `corruptElite` address.",2519,97,4.678781032562256
136,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function, specifically in the line where it sends Ether to the addresses in `refundAddresses`. If any of the addresses in `refundAddresses` is a contract that requires a lot of gas to execute its fallback function, or if it's a contract that has a bug causing it to fail to execute properly, the `send` operation will fail. Since the `require` statement is used, the entire `refundAll` function will revert if any single `send` operation fails. This means that if an attacker can control or predict the addresses in `refundAddresses`, they can cause the `refundAll` function to fail and prevent legitimate refunds from being processed.",995,177,7.43387246131897
137,denial of service," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function of the `DosOneFunc` contract. An attacker can repeatedly call this function to fill the `listAddresses` array with their address. This can potentially exhaust the contract's storage space, leading to a DoS condition where the contract may fail to execute other functions or even become unusable.

The vulnerability is present in the following lines:

```solidity
for(uint i=0;i<350;i++) {
    listAddresses.push(msg.sender);

This line attempts to send the current bid amount to the current frontrunner. If the current frontrunner's address is a contract that does not have a fallback function or if the contract is not designed to handle incoming Ether, the transaction will fail, causing the bid function to revert. This will result in a denial of service as the bid will not be processed, and the auction will not be able to accept new bids.",803,160,6.705016613006592
