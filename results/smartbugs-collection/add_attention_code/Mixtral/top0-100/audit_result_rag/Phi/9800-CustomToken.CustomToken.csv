The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. Although it is not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, it is a common practice in Solidity contracts to use `tx.origin` to check the original sender of a transaction. However, this approach is not secure because it can be bypassed by contracts that call the vulnerable contract.

In the provided code, the `onlyOwner` modifier is used to restrict access to certain functions. However, if a malicious contract calls the `newOwner` or `deleteOwner` functions, it can bypass the `onlyOwner` check because the `msg.sender` will be the address of the malicious contract, not the original sender.

To fix this vulnerability, you should replace the `onlyOwner` modifier with a more secure access control mechanism, such as using a whitelist of authorized addresses or implementing a proxy contract pattern with a separate logic contract and a proxy contract that delegates calls to the logic contract.",1052,227,10.059393167495728
12,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, which inherits from the `BaseToken` contract. The issue is with the constructor of the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the line:

```solidity
balanceOf[0x7F3224B57CBdD3fB2848896F1c31c8aFe91A9aBc] = totalSupply;
```

This line assigns the entire token supply to the address `0x7F3224B57CBdD3fB2848896F1c31c8aFe91A9aBc`. This means that this address has full control over the entire token supply.

The vulnerability is an access control issue, as the `onlyowner` modifier in the `Missing` contract does not prevent the `CustomToken` contract from being deployed by any address. This means that an attacker can deploy the `CustomToken` contract and gain control over the entire token supply.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `CustomToken` contract is deployed by the owner of the `Missing` contract, or implement a mechanism to transfer the token supply to the owner after deployment.",713,295,12.834477424621582

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `addPayout` function, where the `creator` address is not checked before sending Ether to the `etherAddress` of the participant. This means that any participant can call the `addPayout` function and send Ether to their own address, effectively stealing funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `addPayout` function should be modified to include a check that ensures the `etherAddress` being sent Ether to is the same as the `msg.sender` (the address calling the function). This can be done by adding a modifier that checks if the `msg.sender` is the same as the `etherAddress` before sending Ether.

Here's an example of how the `addPayout` function can be modified to fix the vulnerability:

```
modifier onlyOwnerOrCreator(address _creator) {
    require(msg.sender == _creator || msg.sender == creator);

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function, specifically in line 20:

```solidity
require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);
```

This line allows the `msg.sender` to withdraw an amount equal to or greater than their current balance. This could potentially lead to a situation where an attacker can drain the contract's funds by repeatedly calling the `withdraw` function with the maximum balance value.

Additionally, the `migrateTo` function in the `Wallet` contract allows the `creator` to transfer the entire balance of the contract to another address. This could be exploited if the `creator` address is compromised, leading to the loss of funds.

To fix these vulnerabilities, the `withdraw` function should be modified to only allow the `msg.sender` to withdraw their current balance or a smaller amount, and the `migrateTo` function should be restricted to only allow the `creator` to transfer a specific amount or under certain conditions.",915,241,10.295963048934937
15,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being updated with the `totalSupply` value for the address `0x7F3224B57CBdD3fB2848896F1c31c8aFe91A9aBc` before the `Transfer` event is emitted. This can lead to an issue where the `Transfer` event is not emitted for the initial supply transfer, which can cause problems with event tracking and logging.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` contract does not have any access control mechanisms in place, which means that any user can call the `CustomToken()` constructor and potentially reinitialize the contract with a new owner. This can lead to a loss of funds and control over the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you should emit the `Transfer` event before updating the `balanceOf` mapping, and you should add access control mechanisms to the `CustomToken()` constructor to prevent unauthorized reinitialization of the contract.",730,261,11.346367359161377

19,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, which inherits from the `BaseToken` contract. The issue is with the constructor of the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the line where it assigns the total supply to the initial address and then calls the `Transfer` event.

The problem is that the `CustomToken` contract is deploying the `Transfer` event before the `onlyowner` modifier is set in the `Missing` contract. This means that the `Transfer` event is calling the `transfer` function in the `Missing` contract, which is only supposed to be callable by the `owner`. Since the `CustomToken` contract is calling it before the `owner` is set, it bypasses the access control and can potentially lead to unauthorized transfers.

To fix this issue, the `CustomToken` contract should first set the `owner` in the `Missing` contract before calling the `transfer` function.",716,224,9.515549659729004

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `migrateTo` function, which allows the `creator` of the wallet to transfer the entire balance to any address they want. Since the `creator` is set in the `initWallet` function and is not changed afterwards, any user who calls `initWallet` can set themselves as the `creator` and then call `migrateTo` to transfer all funds to another address. This is a serious vulnerability as it allows anyone to drain the wallet's funds.",942,130,5.667790412902832
21,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the access control issue present in the `sendTo` function of the `MyContract` contract. The vulnerability lies in the line `require(tx.origin == owner);`, which uses `tx.origin` to validate the caller of the function.

The `tx.origin` is deprecated and can be bypassed by an attacker using a simple technique called ""transaction forwarding."" In this technique, an attacker can create a transaction that calls the `sendTo` function of the `MyContract` contract, but the actual sender of the transaction will be the attacker, not the intended receiver. This way, the attacker can bypass the `require(tx.right == owner)` check and gain unauthorized access to the contract's functionality.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a more secure method for access control, such as using a modifier or implementing a whitelist of authorized addresses.",660,211,8.978240489959717
22,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `refund` function, which uses `msg.sender.transfer(balances[msg.sender]);` to send the balance back to the caller. This can be exploited by an attacker who is not the owner of the contract but has some funds in the contract.

In Solidity, `msg.sender` refers to the address that is currently calling the contract. In the context of the `refund` function, an attacker can call this function and receive the funds, even though they are not the owner of the contract. This is because the function does not check if the caller is the owner of the contract or has any authorization to perform the refund.

To fix this vulnerability, the `refund` function should be modified to only allow the owner of the contract to perform the refund. This can be achieved by adding a modifier that checks if the caller is the owner and using it in the `refund` function.

Here's an example of how to fix the vulnerability:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Wallet {
    address creator;

    mapping(address => uint256) balances;

    constructor() public {
        creator = msg.sender",974,301,13.014636516571045
23,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the CustomToken contract, specifically in the constructor function CustomToken(). The issue is that the contract's creator (address 0x7F3224B57CBdD3fB2848896F1c31c8aFe91A9aBc) is hardcoded into the contract and is given the entire token supply. This means that the creator has full control over the tokens and can manipulate the contract's state, potentially leading to unintended consequences or exploitation.

Additionally, the use of the deprecated tx.origin to validate callers can also be a potential vulnerability, as it can be exploited by attackers to bypass access control mechanisms. However, in this specific code snippet, tx.origin is not used.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, it is recommended to use a more secure method for assigning the token supply, such as using a separate contract or a trusted oracle, and to avoid using deprecated functions like tx.origin.",607,237,10.447549104690552

The vulnerability lies in the `changeOwner` function in the `Unprotected` contract. The function allows anyone to change the owner of the contract by calling it with the new owner's address as the argument. This is a serious access control issue because the function is public and does not have any checks to ensure that the caller is authorized to change the owner.

In a secure implementation, the `changeOwner` function should be restricted to the current owner or another authorized address. This can be achieved by using the `onlyowner` modifier in the `changeOwner` function, like this:

```solidity
function changeOwner(address _newOwner) public onlyowner {
    owner = _newOwner;
}

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in both the `withdraw` function and the fallback function. The `delegatecall` allows the contract to execute code in the context of another contract, which can lead to access control issues if not properly managed. In this case, the `delegatecall` is used to call functions in the `fibonacciLibrary`, which could potentially be controlled by an attacker.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `fibonacciLibrary` address is set during contract creation and is not verified or controlled afterwards. An attacker could deploy a malicious contract with the same function signature as `setFibonacci` and `fibonacci` in the `fibonacciLibrary`, and then trick the `FibonacciBalance` contract into calling these malicious functions. This could lead to unauthorized access to the contract's funds or other sensitive data.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should verify the `fibonacciLibrary` address and ensure that it only calls functions from a trusted and controlled contract. Additionally, the contract should avoid using `delegatecall` for critical operations like transferring funds, and instead use direct function calls with proper access control checks.",1302,275,12.251660823822021

In this case, if `_secondsToIncrease` is large enough, the `lockTime` value could wrap around to zero, effectively resetting the lock time to zero and allowing the user to withdraw their funds immediately.",863,143,6.1981894969940186

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the following lines:

1. Line 23: `require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`
2. Line 25: `balanceOf[msg.sender] += numTokens;`
3. Line 33: `msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`

In Solidity version 0.4.21, the `+=` and `*=` operators do not check for overflows or underflows. This means that if the result of the operation exceeds the maximum value of a uint256 (2^256 - 1), it will wrap around to 0, leading to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations that check for overflows and underflows. You can import the library and use its functions for addition and multiplication:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.21;

import ""./SafeMath.sol"";

83,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `run` function of the `IntegerOverflowMultiTxMultiFuncFeasible` contract. The line `count -= input;` can cause an underflow if the `input` is greater than the current value of `count`. In Solidity version 0.4.23, there is no built-in overflow or underflow checking, which makes the contract susceptible to this issue.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the `run` function with a large `input` value, causing the `count` to underflow and potentially leading to unexpected behavior or even loss of funds.",666,153,6.807413816452026
84,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The line `balanceOf[0x7F3224B57CBdD3fB2848896F1c31c8aFe91A9aBc] = totalSupply;` is vulnerable to integer overflow.

In Solidity, the `mapping` data structure is initialized with a default value of 0. When assigning the `totalSupply` to the `balanceOf` mapping for the address `0x7F3224B57CBdD3fB2848896F1c3EE036Ac8a1743`, the value of `totalSupply` is added to the existing value of the mapping, which is 0.

However, if the `totalSupply` value is larger than the maximum value of a uint256 (2^256 - 1), an integer overflow will occur, and the resulting value will wrap around to a smaller number. This can lead to incorrect balances and potentially allow attackers to manipulate the contract's state.

85,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being set to `totalSupply` for the address `0x7F3224B57CBdD3fB2848896F1c31c8aFe91A9aBc`. However, the `balanceOf` mapping is not initialized to zero for all addresses before this assignment.

In Solidity, when a mapping is accessed for the first time, its default value is zero. But when a mapping is accessed for the first time with a non-zero value, the default initialization behavior does not apply. In this case, the `balanceOf` mapping is accessed with a non-zero value (`totalSupply`) for the address `0x7F3224B57CBdD3fB2848896F1c31c8aFe91A9aBc`. This can lead to an integer overflow vulnerability if the `totalSupply` value is larger than the maximum value of a uint256 (2^256 - 1).

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the `transfer` function, specifically in the lines where the sender's balance is decremented and the receiver's balance is incremented.

In Solidity version 0.4.18, the `uint` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When subtracting `_value` from `balances[msg.sender]`, if the sender's balance is less than `_value`, an underflow will occur, resulting in an incorrect balance value. This can be exploited by an attacker to drain funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflow and underflow. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath in the `transfer` function:

In Solidity, the `uint256` type is an unsigned integer with a maximum value of 2^256 - 1. When assigning the `totalSupply` to the `balanceOf` mapping, if the `totalSupply` value is greater than or equal to 2^256, it will cause an integer overflow. This can lead to an incorrect balance being assigned to the address, which can be exploited by attackers to manipulate the token balances.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin Contracts, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflows and underflows. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath in the `CustomToken` contract:

The vulnerability lies in the line `balanceOf[_to] += _value;` in the `transfer` function of the `IntegerOverflowAdd` contract. If the `_value` being transferred is large enough, it could cause an integer overflow, leading to incorrect balances and potential loss of funds.

In Solidity, the `+=` operator does not check for overflows, and since the `uint25EE64` type is unsigned, it can wrap around to zero when it overflows. This can result in a recipient receiving more tokens than intended or even all the tokens in the contract if the sender has a large enough balance.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `supportsToken()` function in the `attack` contract. When this function is called, it checks if `hasBeenCalled` is false, and if so, it sets it to true and calls `ModifierEntrancy(msg.sender).airDrop()`.

In a reentrancy attack, an attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the `supportsToken()` function. This would trigger the `airDrop()` function, which transfers tokens to the attacker's address. Since the `airDrop()` function is called before the state of the `attack` contract is updated, the attacker can call the `supportsToken()` function again, leading to another token transfer.

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (in this case, the `msg.sender`) and sending Ether to it before updating the balance of the `acc` struct. This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `Collect` function before the balance update is completed, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the balance update should be done before the external call, and the contract should use the `transfer` or `send` function instead of `call.value` to send Ether to the external contract.",1437,175,7.7366766929626465
117,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function (line 14-18). When the `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""")` line is executed, it allows the caller's code to be executed before the execution of the `withdrawBalance` function is completed. This means that the caller's code can call the `transfer` function, which modifies the state of the contract.

In this case, if an attacker has a malicious contract that calls the `withdrawBalance` function and then calls the `transfer` function, the attacker can drain the funds from the contract before the balance is set to zero. This is because the `transfer` function is called before the balance is updated to zero in the `withdrawBalance` function.

To fix this vulnerability, the balance update should be done before the external call, or the external call should be made in a non-reentrant way.",869,233,10.213650226593018
118,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function, specifically in line 24:

```solidity
if(! (msg.sender.call.value(userBalance[msg.sender])() ) ){
    throw;
}
```

This line allows the `msg.sender` to call the `withdrawBalance` function again before the balance is updated to 0. This can lead to multiple withdrawal calls being made in a single transaction, potentially draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you can update the `withdrawBalance` function to follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern, which means updating the state (userBalance) before interacting with external contracts:

```solidity
function withdrawBalance() {
    userBalance[msg.sender] = userBalance[msg.sender] - msg.value;
    (bool sentSuccessfully) = msg.sender.call.value(msg.value)("""");
    if (!sentSuccessfully) throw;
}
```

This updated function first updates the user'rights balance and then makes the external call, preventing reentrancy attacks.",809,285,12.42959213256836
119,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 52:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the `msg.sender` to make a call to another contract before the execution of the `CashOut` function is complete. If the called contract is malicious and has a fallback function that calls back into the `CashOut` function, it can potentially withdraw funds multiple times before the balance is updated, leading to a reentrancy attack.",1451,125,5.766837120056152
120,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 38:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the CashOut function to send Ether to the msg.sender before updating the balance, which can lead to a reentrancy attack if the msg.sender is a malicious contract that has a fallback function designed to call back into the CashOut function.",1305,107,5.074343681335449
121,reentrancy," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in line 54:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the Collect function before the initial execution is complete, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploitation.",1495,80,3.7227556705474854
122,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 40:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the CashOut function to be called recursively by an external contract before the initial execution is complete. This can lead to unexpected changes in the contract state, potentially resulting in funds being withdrapta.",1321,92,4.511393070220947
123,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 29:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. In this case, the Collect function is vulnerable to reentrancy because it allows the external contract to call the Put function before the balance is deducted.

An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the Collect function and then calls the Put function within the malicious contract. This would result in the balance being increased before it is deducted, effectively stealing funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern, where all state changes are made before any external calls are made. In this case, the balance should be deducted before the Put function is called.",1441,205,9.210596323013306
124,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 38:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the CashOut function to send Ether to the msg.sender before updating the balance, which can lead to a reentrancy attack if the msg.sender is a malicious contract that has a fallback function designed to call back into the CashOut function.",1305,107,5.07896614074707
125,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 54:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (the `msg.sender`) and sending Ether to it before updating the balance of the sender. This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `Collect` function before the balance update is completed, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance of the sender before calling the external contract. Here's an updated version of the `Collect` function:

```solidity
function Collect(uint _am)
    public
    payable
    {
        if(balances[msg.sender]>=MinSum && balances[msgEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE",1497,301,13.321682214736938
126,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract. The issue is that the contract allows external calls to be made before the state changes (updating the user's balance) are completed. This can be exploited by a malicious contract that calls `withdrawBalance` recursively, potentially draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests that you should first perform all checks and effects (state changes) before interacting with external contracts. Here's an updated version of the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract that is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract Reentrancy_secure {
    mapping (address => uint) private userBalances;

    function withdrawBalance() public {
        uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];

        // Perform state changes before interacting with external contracts
        userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;

        // Interact with external contracts
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amountTo",749,301,12.833062887191772
127,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `isSaleFinished()` function of the `TimedCrowdsale` contract, which relies on `block.timestamp` to determine if the sale is finished. As mentioned in the explanation, the `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners, which can lead to incorrect results for the sale's end time.",630,93,4.031609773635864
128,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation due to its reliance on block.timestamp for both the payOut function and the randomGen function. This can be exploited by miners who have control over the timestamp of the block they mine.",909,57,2.633485794067383
129,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `resetInvestment` function, where the condition `if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp+ONE_MINUTE) throw;` is used to prevent the reset from happening too soon after the last investment. However, miners have the ability to manipulate the timestamp within a certain range, which could allow an attacker to bypass this condition and reset the investment prematurely.",1189,106,4.760370492935181
130,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same lines as the original code you provided:

1. Line 18: `require(now!= pastBlockTime);`
2. Line 20: `pastBlockTime = now;`

These lines ensure that only one transaction can be executed per block by comparing the current time (`now`) with the previously stored time (`pastBlockTime`). However, miners have some leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, which can be exploited to manipulate the time and potentially execute multiple transactions per block.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who can control a mining node, allowing them to manipulate the block timestamp and execute multiple transactions per block, leading to potential financial losses for the contract's users.",761,184,7.853941440582275
131,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same line as the first contract:

var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;

This line uses block.timestamp to generate a random number, which can be manipulated by miners. An attacker with enough hash power could influence the block timestamps to control the outcome of the random number generation, potentially winning the lottery multiple times or avoiding paying fees.",975,109,4.817359685897827
132,short addresses," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to short address attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `sendCoin` function handles the `to` address parameter. In Solidity, addresses are 20 bytes long, but when passed as arguments to functions, they can be padded with zeros. If an attacker uses a short address (less than 20 bytes), the padding can cause the `to` address to be interpreted incorrectly, potentially leading to funds being sent to an unintended recipient.

To fix this issue, the `sendCoin` function should explicitly check the length of the `to` address and reject any short addresses:

```solidity
function sendCoin(address to, uint amount) returns(bool sufficient) {
    if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) return false;
    if (to.length!= 20) return false;
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[to] += amount;
    Transfer(msgEE.sender, to, amount);
    return true;
}
```

This change ensures that only valid, 20-byte addresses are accepted, mitigating the short address vulnerability.",968,270,11.511601448059082
133,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. An attacker can repeatedly call the `addCreditors` function to fill the `creditorAddresses` array until it reaches a length of 1500. Once this threshold is reached, the `emptyCreditors` function will be triggered, which clears the entire `creditorAddresses` array. This can be done repeatedly, causing the contract to be in a constant state of clearing and refilling the array, which can lead to a DoS condition as the contract's state is constantly changing and can be exploited to prevent legitimate use of the contract.",933,153,6.634875059127808
134,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the contract attempts to dynamically resize the `array` if `numElements` reaches the current length of the `array`.

In Solidity, arrays are fixed-size data structures, and their size cannot be changed once they are initialized. The line `array.length += 1;` is attempting to change the size of the array, which is not allowed and will result in a runtime error. This error will cause the transaction to revert, effectively denying service to the user who initiated the transaction.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should be modified to allocate enough space for the `array` before inserting elements into it, or use a dynamic array type that allows resizing, such as `uint[]`.",1060,190,8.317331075668335
135,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the reset of the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays when a new credit cycle starts. This can be exploited by repeatedly calling the `lendGovernmentMoney` function, which will cause the arrays to be reset and potentially lead to a situation where the contract is unable to process legitimate transactions.",2484,95,5.047162771224976
136,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function, specifically in line 24:

```solidity
require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));
```

This line attempts to send Ether to each address in the `refundAddresses` array. If any of the addresses in the array is a contract that has a fallback function that consumes a significant amount of gas, it could potentially cause the transaction to fail due to insufficient gas. Since the `refundAll` function is iterating over all addresses in the array, a single failure would cause the entire function to fail, preventing the refunds from being sent to the other addresses.

Additionally, if any of the addresses in the `refundAddresses` array is a contract that has a fallback function that deliberately consumes a large amount of gas or causes a delay, it could also lead to a denial of service attack.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you could consider adding a gas limit to the `refundAll` function or implementing a mechanism to handle failures gracefully, such as retrying the transaction or logging the failed transactions for later processing.",960,286,12.175698041915894
137,denial of service," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function of the `DosOneFunc` contract. An attacker can repeatedly call this function, causing the contract to continuously fill the `listAddresses` array with the attacker's address. This can lead to the contract consuming all available gas, effectively denying service to other users and contracts that interact with it.

The gas consumption issue arises from the fact that the `ifillArray` function does not have a gas limit, and the `listAddresses.push(msg.sender)` operation consumes a significant amount of gas. By repeatedly calling this function, an attacker can deplete the available gas in the network, causing the contract to become unresponsive and denying service to other users and contracts.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should implement a gas limit for the `ifillArray` function or use a more efficient data structure to store the addresses.",778,229,10.00500226020813
138,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the same reason as the first contract. The vulnerability lies in line 23:

```solidity
require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));
```

This line attempts to send the current bid amount to the current frontrunner. If the current frontrunner's address is a contract that does not have a fallback function or a receive function, the transaction will fail, causing a denial of service. This is because the contract will not be able to process the transaction, and the bid function will not be able to complete successfully.",768,147,6.596939563751221
