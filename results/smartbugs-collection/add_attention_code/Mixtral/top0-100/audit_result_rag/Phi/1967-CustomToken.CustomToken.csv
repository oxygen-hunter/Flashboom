The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. Although it is not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, the use of `tx.origin` is a common mistake in Solidity contracts that can lead to access control issues.

In Solidity, `tx.origin` refers to the original transaction initiator, which is the external account that initiated the transaction. However, `tx.origin` can be spoofed by intermediate contracts, allowing attackers to bypass access control checks.

In the provided code, the `onlyOwner` modifier is used to restrict access to certain functions. However, if the contract uses `tx.origin` for access control, it can be vulnerable to attacks where an attacker calls the contract through an intermediate contract, effectively spoofing the `tx.origin` and bypassing the access control checks.

To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a more secure approach for access control, such as using a mapping to store the owners and verifying the caller's address against the mapping.",1047,243,10.119728565216064
12,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being updated with the `totalSupply` amount for the address `0x49d2a86d9c36c6fe55225fdaa6c0deb7fd9d5b39` without any access control checks. This means that any user can call the `CustomToken()` constructor and assign the entire supply to their own address, effectively stealing the entire supply of the token.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add an access control modifier to the `CustomToken()` constructor, ensuring that only the owner of the contract can call it. Here's an updated version of the `CustomToken` contract with the access control fix:

```solidity
contract CustomToken is BaseToken {
    address private owner;

    modifier onlyowner {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        _;
    }

    function CustomToken() public onlyowner {
        totalSupply = 3000000000000000000000000000;

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `addPayout` function, where the `creator` address is not checked before sending Ether to the `Participant` addresses. This means that any user can call the `addPayout` function and send Ether to the `Participant` addresses, potentially draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `addPayout` function should be modified to include a modifier that checks if the caller is the `creator` before allowing the function to execute. This can be done by adding a `creatorOnly` modifier and applying it to the `addPayout` function, similar to how the `onlyOwner` modifier is used in other functions.

Here's an example of how the `addPayout` function can be modified to include the `creatorOnly` modifier:

```solidity
modifier creatorOnly {
    require(msg.sender == creator);
    _;
}

function addPayout(uint _fee) creatorOnly private {
    //... existing code...
}
```

By adding this modification, the `addPayout` function will only be accessible by the `creator` address, preventing unauthorized users from draining the contract's funds.",3369,301,13.448756217956543
14,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function (line 17) where the `require` statement checks if the `amount` to be withdrawn is greater than or equal to the balance of the caller (`balances[msg.sender]`). This check is unnecessary and could potentially be exploited.

In a properly designed withdrawal function, the `require` statement should only check if the `amount` is less than or equal to the balance of the caller, ensuring that the caller cannot withdraw more than they have. The current implementation allows the caller to withdraw exactly their balance, which is not a vulnerability in itself, but the check is redundant and could lead to confusion or misuse.

Additionally, the `deposit` function (line 12) uses the `assert` statement to check if the deposit amount is greater than the current balance of the caller. This check is also unnecessary and could be exploited by an attacker to deposit a negative amount, which would result in the contract reverting.

To fix these issues, the `require` statement in the `withdraw` function should be updated to check if the `amount` is less than or equal to the balance of the caller, and the `assert` statement in the `deposit` function should be removed.",910,295,12.220641136169434

19,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being updated with the `totalSupply` amount for the address `0x49d2a86d9c36c6fe55225fdaa6c0deb7fd9d5b39` before the `Transfer` event is emitted. This can lead to an incorrect event emission and potential issues with the token's supply tracking.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` contract does not have any access control mechanisms in place, which means that any function within the contract can be called by any external account. This can lead to potential vulnerabilities if the contract is extended or if other functions are added in the future.

Moreover, the `CustomToken` contract does not inherit the `onlyowner` modifier from the `Missing` contract, which means that the access control vulnerability from the `Missing` contract is not present in the `CustomToken` contract. However, it is still recommended to implement access control mechanisms in the `CustomToken` contract to ensure proper security.",711,266,10.987149953842163

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `migrateTo` function, which allows the `creator` to transfer the contract's balance to any address. Since the `creator` is set in the `initWallet` function and is not protected, any user who calls `initWallet` can set themselves as the `creator`. This means they can then call `migrateTo` to transfer the contract's funds to any address they choose, effectively allowing them to steal the contract's funds.",937,125,5.297653436660767

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `refund` function, which uses `msg.sender.transfer(balances[msg.sender]);` to send the balance back to the caller. This can be exploited by an attacker who is not the intended recipient of the refund.

In Solidity, `msg.sender` is the address that is currently calling the contract. In the context of the `refund` function, `msg.sender` is the address that initiated the refund transaction. However, this does not necessarily mean that the address is authorized to receive the refund. An attacker could call the `refund` function from an unauthorized address and receive the funds intended for the original owner.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should implement proper access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized addresses can call the `refund` function. This can be achieved by using a modifier that checks if the caller is authorized or by implementing a role-based access control system.",969,235,9.754185676574707
23,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the CustomToken contract, specifically in the constructor function CustomToken(). The contract is inheriting from BaseToken, which has a public mapping (balanceOf) that stores the balance of tokens for each address. In the constructor function, the contract is assigning the entire totalSupply to a single address (0x49d2a86d9c36c6fe55225fdaa6c0deb7fd9d5b39) and then emitting a Transfer event.

This can lead to an access control issue because the constructor function is public, meaning that any user can call it and potentially create a new instance of the CustomToken contract with the same logic. This can result in multiple instances of the contract with the same address having the same balance mapping, which can lead to confusion and potential exploitation.

Additionally, the contract is not using any access control mechanisms to restrict who can call the constructor function, which can lead to unauthorized creation of new instances of the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the constructor function should be made private, and access control mechanisms should be implemented to restrict who can call the constructor function.",602,268,10.999464511871338

The vulnerability lies in the `changeOwner` function in the `Unprotected` contract. This function allows anyone to change the owner of the contract by calling it with the new owner's address as an argument. Since the `changeOwner` function is public and does not have any access control checks, it can be exploited by any user to change the ownership of the contract.

This can lead to various issues, such as unauthorized access to sensitive data, manipulation of contract logic, or even theft of funds if the contract holds any. To fix this vulnerability, the `changeOwner` function should be modified to include access control checks, ensuring that only the current owner or a designated authority can change the ownership of the contract.",706,170,7.078966856002808

This line uses the `call` low-level function to send ether and execute arbitrary code on the `adr` address. The return value of the `call` function is not checked, which means that if the call fails, the contract will continue to execute without reverting the transaction. This can lead to fail-open situations and other unwanted outcomes.

To fix this vulnerability, the return value of the `call` function should be checked, and the transaction should be reverted if the call fails. Here's an example of how to fix the vulnerability:

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable due to the unchecked low-level call in the `WithdrawToken` function of the `Token` contract. The line `token.call(bytes4(sha3(""transfer(address,uint256)"")),to,amount);` does not check the return value of the `call` operation. If the `call` fails, the function will continue to execute, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `call` operation should be wrapped in a `require` statement to check the return value and revert the transaction if the call fails. Here's an example of how to fix the vulnerability:

In Solidity, the `uint256` type is an unsigned integer with a maximum value of 2^256 - 1. When assigning the `totalSupply` to the `balanceOf` mapping, if the `totalSupply` value is greater than the maximum value of `uint256`, it will cause an integer overflow.

In this case, the `totalSupply` is set to 3000000000000000000000000000, which is within the range of `uint256`. However, if the `totalSupply` were to be set to a value greater than 2^256 - 1, it would cause an integer overflow and potentially lead to incorrect balances being stored in the `balanceOf` mapping.

```

In Solidity, the `uint` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When an overflow occurs, the result wraps around to zero. In this case, if `_secondsToIncrease` is large enough, the `lockTime` value can overflow and become zero, allowing the user to withdraw their funds immediately, bypassing the intended lock time.",858,142,5.971015691757202

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the following lines:

1. Line 23: `require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`
2. Line 25: `balanceOf[msg.sender] += numTokens;`
3. Line 33: `msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`

In Solidity version 0.4.21, the `uint256` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When an arithmetic operation results in a value that exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by `uint2EE64`, it wraps around to zero. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

In the code, if the `numTokens` variable is large enough, the multiplication operation in lines 23 and 33 can cause an integer overflow, resulting in a smaller value than expected. This can lead to incorrect balances and transfers, potentially allowing attackers to manipulate the token balances or steal funds.

The vulnerability lies in the `run` function of the `IntegerOverflowMultiTxMultiFuncFeasible` contract. The line `count -= input;` can cause an underflow if the `input` is greater than the current value of `count`. In Solidity, when an underflow occurs, the value wraps around to the maximum possible value of the type, which in this case is `uint256`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially be exploited by an attacker.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library provided by OpenZeppelin, which includes built-in overflow checks for arithmetic operations. Here's an example of how you can modify the `run` function to use SafeMath:

In Solidity, the `uint256` type is an unsigned integer with a maximum value of 2^256 - 1. When assigning a value to a `uint256` variable, if the value is greater than the maximum value, it will wrap around to 0. In this case, the `totalSupply` is set to 3000000000000000000000000000, which is less than the maximum value of `uint256`. However, the vulnerability arises when the `totalSupply` is increased by the amount transferred in the `Transfer` event.

If the `Transfer` event is triggered multiple times, the `totalSupply` can exceed the maximum value of `uint2EE6`, causing an integer overflow. This can lead to incorrect balances and potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the token supply.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the `CustomToken()` constructor function. The issue is that the `totalSupply` is set to a very large number (3000000000000000000000000000), and then the entire supply is transferred to the address `0x49d2a86d9c36c6fe55225fdaa6c0deb7fd9d5b39`.

The problem arises when the `balanceOf` mapping is accessed with the large `totalSupply` value. Since the `balanceOf` mapping is a key-value storage, the key is hashed, and the hash function may not produce a unique result for such a large number. This can lead to an integer overflow, causing the `balanceOf` mapping to store an incorrect value for the address `0x49d2a86d9c36c6fe55225fdaa6c0deb7fd9d5b39`.

An attacker with sufficient resources could potentially predict the block hash and thus the output of the `rand` function.

Additionally, the use of a constant factor `FACTOR` in the calculation of the random number introduces another layer of predictability. If an attacker knows the value of `FACTOR` and the maximum value `max`, they can reverse-engineer the random number generation process.

This line allows the `msg.sender` to call the `ReentrancyDAO` contract again before the state changes (balance and credit updates) are completed. If the `msg.sender` contract is malicious and designed to exploit this vulnerability, it can call the `withdrawAll` function recursively, draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you should update the state (balance and credit) before making the external call. Here's an updated version of the `withdrawAll` function:

```solidity
function withdrawAll() public {
    uint oCredit = credit[msg.sender];
    if (oCredit > 0) {
        balance -= oCredit;

117,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function (line 14-18). When the `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""")` line is executed, it allows the external contract to make a call to the `transfer` function before the state of the contract has been updated. This can lead to the `transfer` function being called multiple times, potentially draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the state before making the external call. Here's an example of how the `withdrawBalance` function can be modified to prevent reentrancy attacks:

```solidity
function withdrawBalance() public {
    uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];

    // Update the state before making the external call
    userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;

    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""");

129,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `resetInvestment` function, where the condition `if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp+ONE_MINUTE) throw;` is used to prevent the reset from happening too soon after the last investment. However, miners have the ability to manipulate the timestamp within a certain range, which could allow an attacker to bypass this condition by mining a block with a timestamp that is just over the `lastInvestmentTimestamp + ONE_MINUTE`. This would enable the attacker to call `resetInvestment` and potentially steal the jackpot.",1184,145,6.174962282180786
130,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same lines as the previous code:

- Line 18: `require(now!= pastBlockTime);`
- Line 20: `pastBlockTime = now;`

These lines ensure that only one transaction per block can successfully execute the `if(now % 15 == 0)` condition, which transfers the contract's balance to the sender. However, miners have some leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, which can be manipulated to a certain extent. This means that a miner could potentially delay the execution of the contract's code to manipulate the outcome of the `if(now % 15 == 0)` condition.

In a scenario where a malicious miner wants to prevent a specific user from receiving funds, they could delay the execution of the contract's code until after the 15-second interval has passed, causing the user to miss out on the funds.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should not rely on the current time as a critical factor in its logic. Instead, it could use a more reliable source of time or implement a different mechanism to ensure fairness and prevent time manipulation.",756,278,11.445931673049927
131,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same line as the first contract:

An attacker with enough hash power could influence the block timestamp to control the outcome of the random number generation, potentially winning the lottery multiple times or avoiding paying fees.",970,107,4.5849549770355225
132,short addresses," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to short address attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `sendCoin` function handles the `to` address parameter. In Solidity, addresses are 20 bytes long, but when passed as arguments to functions, they can be padded with zeros. If an attacker uses a short address (less than 20 bytes), the contract might interpret it as a different, valid address, leading to funds being sent to the wrong recipient.

To fix this issue, the `sendCoin` function should explicitly check the length of the `to` address and reject any short addresses:

```solidity
function sendCoin(address to, uint amount) returns(bool sufficient) {
    if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) return false;
    if (to.length!= 20) return false;
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[to] += amount;
    Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);

133,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. An attacker can repeatedly call the `addCreditors` function to fill the `creditorAddresses` array until it reaches a length greater than 1500. Once this happens, the `emptyCreditors` function will be triggered, which clears the `creditorAddresses` array and sets the `win` variable to true. This can be exploited to disrupt the normal operation of the contract by repeatedly adding and removing creditors, potentially causing a DoS condition if the contract is expected to maintain a certain number of creditors for its intended functionality.",928,151,6.34749698638916
134,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles dynamic array resizing. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the array is being resized and elements are being added:

1. Line 18: `for(uint i=0;i<numbers;i++) {`
2. Line 19: `if(numElements == array.length) {`
3. Line 20: `array.length += 1;`
4. Line 21: `}`
5. Line 22: `array[numElements++] = value;`

The issue is that Solidity does not allow for dynamic resizing of arrays in a loop. The line `array.length += 1;` is not valid Solidity syntax and will result in a compilation error. However, if we assume that the intention was to resize the array using the correct syntax, the problem still remains.

When the array is resized, it consumes a significant amount of gas. If an attacker repeatedly calls the `insertNnumbers` function with a large number of elements, they can deplete the gas available to the contract, leading to a Denial of Service attack. This can render the contract unusable for legitimate users, as they would not have enough gas",1055,301,12.419209957122803
135,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the reset of the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays when a new credit cycle starts. This can be exploited by repeatedly calling the `lendGovernmentMoney` function, which will cause the arrays to be reset and the contract to lose track of the creditor addresses and amounts, effectively preventing the creditor addresses from receiving their funds.",2479,104,4.95426344871521
136,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function, specifically in line 24:

```solidity
require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));
```

This line attempts to send Ether to each address in the `refundAddresses` array. However, if any of the addresses in the array is a contract that does not have a fallback function or has a fallback function that requires a specific amount of Ether or data to be sent, the transaction will fail. Since the `require` statement is used, the entire function will revert if any transaction fails. This means that an attacker can simply call the `refundAll` function with an address that will cause the transaction to fail, effectively causing a denial of service by preventing the function from completing its intended operation.

Additionally, the `send` function only transfers Ether and does not revert the transaction if the transfer fails. This can lead to a situation where the contract sends Ether to an address that is not intended to receive it, potentially causing financial loss.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you can use the `transfer` function instead of `send`, which reverts the transaction if the transfer fails. However, this still does not address",955,301,12.392573118209839
137,denial of service," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function of the `DosOneFunc` contract. An attacker can repeatedly call this function, causing the contract to continuously fill the `listAddresses` array with the attacker's address. This can lead to the contract consuming all available gas, effectively denying service to other users and contracts that interact with it.

The gas consumption issue arises from the fact that the `ifillArray` function does not have a gas limit, and the `listAddresses.push(msg.sender)` operation consumes a significant amount of gas. By repeatedly calling this function, an attacker can deplete the available gas in the network, causing the contract to become unresponsive and denying service to other users and contracts.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should implement a gas limit for the `ifillArray` function or use a more efficient data structure to store the addresses.",773,229,9.52386474609375

This line attempts to send the current bid amount to the current frontrunner. If the current frontrunner's address is a contract that does not have a fallback function or if the fallback function is not implemented correctly, the transaction will fail, and the contract will not be able to proceed with the auction. This can lead to a denial of service as the auction cannot continue.",763,150,6.259541273117065
