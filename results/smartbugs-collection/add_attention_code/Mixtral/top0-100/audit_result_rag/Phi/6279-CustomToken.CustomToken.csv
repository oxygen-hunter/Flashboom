11,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function in the `MultiOwnable` contract. The function allows any user to become an owner by calling it, without any proper authorization checks. This means that any user can become an owner and gain control over the contract's functions that are restricted to owners only.

The `newOwner` function should be modified to include proper authorization checks, ensuring that only the root owner or the current owner can add new owners. This can be achieved by adding an `onlyOwner` modifier to the `newOwner` function, similar to the `deleteOwner` function.

Here's an updated version of the `MultiOwnable` contract with the `newOwner` function modified to include the `onlyOwner` modifier:

```solidity

The smart contract code provided is vulnerable due to the use of `msg.sender` in the `missing()` function to set the `owner` variable. This allows any user to call the `missing()` function and set themselves as the owner of the contract.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the `msg.sender` check in the `DynamicPyramid` function. This function allows any user to call it and set the `creator` variable to their address. This means that any user can become the owner of the contract, which can lead to unauthorized access and control over the contract's functionality.

To fix this vulnerability, the `DynamicPyramid` function should only be callable by the original deployer of the contract or a designated admin address. This can be achieved by using a modifier that checks if the `msg.sender` is the deployer or admin address before allowing the function to be called.",3426,150,7.152467250823975
14,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor where the initial supply is being assigned to the creator's address. This allows the creator to have full control over the token supply without any restrictions, which can lead to potential misuse or manipulation of the token's distribution.

In the `CustomToken` constructor, the line `balanceOf[0x2e8f7bd73790a242f1271a381a3d0011078e9fc8] = totalSupply;` assigns the entire token supply to the creator's address. This means that the creator can transfer or manipulate the entire token supply without any checks or restrictions, which is a significant access control vulnerability.

To fix this issue, you should implement a more secure access control mechanism, such as using a modifier to restrict certain functions to specific roles or addresses, or by implementing a multi-signature mechanism to ensure that token transfers require approval from multiple parties.",967,244,10.147790670394897
15,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being updated with the `totalSupply` amount to the address `0x2e8f7bd73790a242f1271a381a3d0011078e9fc8` before the constructor finishes execution. This means that if the constructor is called by an unauthorized address, it could potentially transfer the entire supply of tokens to an unintended address.

The `CustomToken` contract does not have any access control checks in its constructor, making it vulnerable to unauthorized creation and distribution of tokens.",782,173,7.22663426399231
16,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `set` function (line 20), which allows anyone to modify the `map` array by providing a `key` and a `value`. Since there is no access control mechanism to restrict who can call this function, any user can potentially overwrite or manipulate the data stored in the `map` array. This can lead to unauthorized changes in the contract's state and compromise the integrity of the data.",867,110,4.678178310394287

18,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the access control issue in the `PopBonusCode` function. The condition `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length);` is always true because array lengths are unsigned and cannot be negative. This means that the `require` statement does not effectively prevent unauthorized access to the `PopBonusCode` function.",1001,83,3.613126039505005
19,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being updated with the `totalSupply` before the constructor has finished executing. This can lead to a situation where the `balanceOf` mapping is accessible and modifiable by other contracts or functions before the contract is fully initialized, which can result in an incorrect state or unintended behavior.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` contract does not have any access control mechanisms in place, which means that any function within the contract can be called by any external account. This can lead to potential vulnerabilities if the contract's functions are not properly secured.

Moreover, the `CustomToken` contract inherits from the `BaseToken` contract, which has a public `balanceOf` mapping. This means that anyone can access the token balances of all addresses, which is a privacy concern and can be exploited in various ways.

To fix these issues, the `CustomToken` constructor should be marked as `internal` or `private` to prevent external calls, and the `balanceOf` mapping should be updated after the constructor has finished executing. Additionally, access control mechanisms should be implemented to restrict access to sensitive functions within the contract.",768,286,11.785237073898315
20,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `migrateTo` function, which allows the `creator` of the contract to transfer the entire balance of the contract to any address they choose. Since the `creator` is set in the `initWallet` function and is not changed afterwards, any user who calls `initWallet` can set themselves as the `creator`. This means that they can then call the `migrateTo` function to transfer all the funds to their own address or to another address, effectively draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `creator` should be set to a fixed address (e.rights reserved by the contract owner) and not be changeable by any other user. Additionally, the `migrateTo` function should be removed or properly secured to prevent unauthorized transfers.",994,199,8.314786911010742

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `refund` function, which uses `msg.sender.transfer(balances[msg.sender]);` to send the balance back to the caller.

23,access control," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being updated with a public function, which can be called by any external contract or user. This means that an attacker could potentially call this function and manipulate the balances of the token, leading to unauthorized access and potential loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `CustomToken` constructor should be made private, or the `balanceOf` mapping should be updated in a more secure way, such as through a separate function with proper access control checks.",659,148,6.181607484817505
24,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The `changeOwner` function in the `Unprotected` contract allows anyone to change the owner of the contract by calling `changeOwner(_newOwner)` with the desired address. However, the `CustomToken` contract inherits from `Unprotected` and does not override the `changeOwner` function.

In the constructor of `CustomToken`, the initial owner is set to `0x2e8f7bd73790a242f1271a381a3d0011078e9fc8`. Since the `changeOwner` function is not overridden, any user can call `changeOwner` on an instance of `CustomToken` and change the owner to any address they want. This is a significant access control vulnerability, as it allows an attacker to take control of the contract and its funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `CustomToken` contract should override the `changeOwner` function and implement proper access control checks to ensure that only authorized users can change the owner of the contract.",763,261,10.778900861740112
25,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `tx.origin` for access control in the `Phishable` contract. This can be exploited through phishing attacks where an attacker tricks the owner into signing a transaction that calls the `withdrawAll` function, allowing the attacker to drain the contract's funds.",744,78,3.3448009490966797
26,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in both the `withdraw` function and the fallback function. The `delegatecall` allows the contract to execute code in the context of another contract, which can lead to access control issues if not properly managed. In this case, the `withdraw` function and the fallback function are calling the `FibonacciLib` contract, which could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code if they can control the input to the `delegatecall`.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `delegatecall` is not checking the caller's permissions before executing the code in the `FibonacciLib` contract. This could allow an attacker to call the `setFibonacci` function and change the `calculatedFibNumber` value, which is then used in the `withdraw` function to calculate the amount of Ether to be transferred.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should implement proper access control mechanisms, such as using a modifier to check the caller's permissions before executing sensitive functions, or using a more secure method to call external contracts.",1354,252,10.5568368434906

This line is using the low-level `call` function, which does not revert the transaction if the call fails. This can lead to unexpected outcomes and potential exploits.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the `safeTransferFrom` function from the ERC20 standard, which reverts the transaction if the call fails. Here's an example of how to use it:

```solidity
function Command(address adr, bytes data) public {

    (bool success, ) = adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);
    require(success, ""Call failed"");
}
```

In this example, we first check if the `msg.sender` is the `Owner` and then use the `safeTransferFrom` function to transfer tokens to the `msg.sender`. After that, we use the `call` function to execute the `data` payload. If the call fails, the transaction will revert, preventing potential exploits.",2283,299,13.155202150344849

The vulnerability lies in the `IntegerOverflowMul` contract, specifically in the `run` function at line 17: `count *= input;`. This line of code is susceptible to integer overflow because it multiplies the `count` variable by the `input` without any checks for overflow.

In Solidity, when an integer overflow occurs, the result wraps around to the minimum value of the type. For example, if `count` is `2**256 - 1` and `input` is `2`, the result of the multiplication would be `0` instead of the expected `4`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially be exploited by attackers.

In Solidity, when assigning a value to a mapping, the right-hand side of the assignment is implicitly converted to the type of the mapping's value. In this case, the `totalSupply` is a `uint256`, and the `balanceOf` mapping is of type `mapping (address => uint256)`.

The issue arises when the `totalSupply` value is too large to fit into the `balanceOf` mapping. If the `totalSupply` value is larger than the maximum value of a `uint256`, it will cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect balance being assigned to the address `0x2e8f7bd73790a242f1271a381a3d0011078e9fc8`.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the following lines:

1. Line 23: `require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`
2. Line 25: `balanceOf[msg.sender] += numTokens;`
3. Line 33: `msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`

In Solidity version 0.4.21, the `*` operator does not check for overflow or underflow. This means that if the result of the multiplication exceeds the maximum value of a uint256, it will wrap around to zero, leading to incorrect calculations and potentially allowing attackers to manipulate the contract's behavior.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflow and underflow. You can import the library and use its functions for multiplication and addition.

Here's an example of how you can use SafeMath to fix the vulnerability:

```solidity

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor where the `balanceOf` mapping is set for the initial address. The line `balanceOf[0x2e8f7bd73790a242f1271a381a3d0011078e9fc8] = totalSupply;` is setting the balance for the initial address to the total supply of the token.

The issue arises when the `decimals` value is not taken into account. In Ethereum, the smallest unit of a token is called a ""wei,"" and the `decimals` value determines the number of decimal places for the token. In this case, `decimals` is set to 18, which means that the smallest unit of the token is 10^(-18) of the total supply.

However, the line `balanceOf[0x2e8f7bd7379EE2997949789E71A08Bd0E4F62985] = totalSupply;` is assigning the total supply directly to the balance, without considering the `decimals` value. This can lead to an integer overflow when the balance is later",718,301,12.364450454711914

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The line `balanceOf[0x2e8f7bd73790a242f1271a381a3d0011078e9fc8] = totalSupply;` is vulnerable to integer overflow.

In Solidity, when assigning a value to a variable, if the value is larger than the maximum value that the variable can hold, it will wrap around to the minimum value. In this case, the `uint256` type can hold values up to 2^256 - 1. If the `totalSupply` value is larger than this maximum value, the assignment will cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect balance for the address `0x2e8f7bd73790a242f1271a381a3d0011078e9fc8`.

The issue arises when the `decimals` value is set to 18, which means that the smallest unit of the token is 10^(-18) of the total token. When the total supply is set to `2100000000000000000000000000`, it is equivalent to 21 billion tokens. However, when the balance is assigned to the address, it is done in the smallest unit of the token, which is 10^(-18) of the total token.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the same type of arithmetic overflow issue as the first contract. The vulnerability lies in the `transfer` function, specifically in the lines:

```solidity
require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
```

In Solidity version 0.4.18, the `uint` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When subtracting `_value` from `balances[msg.sender]`, if the result is less than 0, it will wrap around to a very large positive number due to the nature of unsigned integer arithmetic. This can lead to an incorrect balance and potentially allow the attacker to drain funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflows and underflows. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath in the `transfer` function:

However, miners have some control over the block hash, and they can influence the outcome of the randomness generation. This can lead to predictable or manipulable outcomes, which can be exploited by malicious users.

Additionally, the function uses a constant factor `FACTOR` and a fixed multiplier `multiplier` to calculate the random number. This can also lead to predictable outcomes, as the same inputs will always produce the same outputs.

117,reentrancy," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack due to the way the `withdrawBalance` function is implemented. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the contract allows external calls to be made before the state changes are finalized. Specifically, the issue is with the line:

```solidity
(bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""");
```

This line sends Ether to the `msg.sender` before updating the `userBalances` mapping. If the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract with a fallback function designed to call back into the `withdrawBalance` function, it can potentially withdraw funds multiple times before the balance is updated, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the `userBalances` mapping before sending Ether to the `msg.sender`. Here's an example of how the `withdrawBalance` function can be modified to prevent reentrancy attacks:

```solidity
function withdrawBalance() public {
    uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
    userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;

    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""");

The vulnerability lies in line 54:

```solidity

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (the msg.sender) and sending Ether to it before updating the balances. This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `Collect` function before the balance update is completed, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance before sending Ether to the external contract. Here's an updated version of the `Collect` function:

```solidity
function Collect(uint _am)
public
payable
{
    if(balances[msg.sender]>=MinSum && balances[msg.sender]>=_am)
    {

126,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract. The issue is that the contract allows external calls to be made before the state of the contract is updated. In this case, the `userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;` line is executed after the external call, which means that if the external call is a reentrant call, it can withdraw the balance again before the balance is updated to zero.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests that you should first perform all checks and effects (updating the state) before interacting with external contracts. Here's an updated version of the `withdrawBalance` function:

```solidity
function withdrawBalance() public {
    uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
    userBalances[msg.sender] = EEEEEEEEEEE; // Set the balance to a non-zero value that is not equal to the original balance
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""");

129,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `resetInvestment` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp+ONE_MINUTE)
```

This line checks if the current block timestamp is less than the `lastInvestmentTimestamp` plus one minute. An attacker can exploit this by manipulating the block timestamp to be just under one minute after the `lastInvestmentTimestamp`, allowing them to call the `resetInvestment` function and reset the jackpot and last investor.

This vulnerability can be exploited by the `Attacker` contract, which calls the `resetInvestment` function of the `Governmental` contract. The attacker can manipulate the block timestamp to bypass the time check and reset the jackpot and last investor.

To fix this vulnerability, the time check should be based on a more reliable source of time, such as an external oracle or a time-lock mechanism that doesn't rely solely on the block timestamp.",1241,243,10.150450229644775

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. An attacker can repeatedly call the `addCreditors` function to fill the `creditorAddresses` array until it reaches a size of 1500. Once this happens, the `emptyCreditors` function will be triggered, which clears the `creditorAddresses` array and sets the `win` variable to true. This can be exploited to disrupt the normal operation of the contract by repeatedly triggering the `emptyCreditors` function, effectively denying service to legitimate users.",985,139,5.890580892562866
134,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles the dynamic resizing of the `array` when inserting elements. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the contract checks if `numElements` is equal to `array.length` and then increments `array.length` by 1.

Here's the problematic part of the code:

```solidity
for(uint i=0;i<numbers;i++) {
    if(numElements == array.length) {
        array.length += 1;
    }
    array[numElements++] = value;
}
```

The issue is that Solidity does not allow you to directly change the length of a dynamically-sized array. The line `array.length += 1;` is not valid Solidity code and will not compile. However, the intention behind this line seems to be to resize the array when it's full.

The correct way to resize a dynamically-sized array in Solidity is to use the `push` method, which automatically resizes the array when needed. Here's how you can modify the `insertNnumbers` function to avoid the DoS vulnerability:

The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function, specifically in line 24:

```solidity

```

This line attempts to send Ether to each address in the `refundAddresses` array. If any of the `send` operations fail, the entire `refundAll` function will fail due to the `require` statement. This can be exploited by an attacker who can control one of the addresses in the `refundAddresses` array. By sending a transaction to that address, the attacker can cause the `refundAll` function to fail, effectively denying service to the contract.

Additionally, the `send` function itself is considered unsafe and can lead to denial of service attacks. It is recommended to use the `transfer` function instead, which reverts the entire transaction if the transfer fails. However, even with `transfer`, the contract is still vulnerable to denial of service attacks if an attacker can control one of the addresses in the `refundAddresses` array.",1012,268,11.141778945922852
