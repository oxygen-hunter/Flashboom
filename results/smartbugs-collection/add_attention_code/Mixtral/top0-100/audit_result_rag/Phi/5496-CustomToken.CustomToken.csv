11,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function in the `MultiOwnable` contract. The issue is that the `newOwner` function allows any user to become an owner of the contract by calling the function and passing their address as the `_owner` parameter. This means that any user can become an owner without the consent of the current owners, which is a significant access control issue.

The `newOwner` function should only allow the current owner (root) to add new owners, not any user. This can be fixed by adding a check in the `newOwner` function to ensure that only the root can call it.

Here's the updated `newOwner` function:

```solidity
function newOwner(address _owner) external onlyOwner returns (bool) {
    require(_owner!= 0);
    owners[_owner] = msg.sender;
    return true;
}
```

By adding the `onlyOwner` modifier, we ensure that only the current owner can call the `newOwner` function and add new owners.",1107,245,10.254910707473755

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `addPayout` function, where the `creator` address is not checked before sending funds to the `Participant` addresses. This means that any user can call the `addPayout` function and send funds to the `Participant` addresses, potentially draining the contract's balance.

To fix this vulnerability, the `addPayout` function should be modified to include a modifier that checks if the caller is the `creator` before allowing the function to execute. This can be done by adding a `onlyOwner` modifier similar to the one used in the `changeOwner` function.

Here's an example of how the `addPayout` function can be modified to include the `onlyOwner` modifier:

```solidity
modifier onlyOwner {
    require(msg.sender == creator);
    _;
}

function addPayout(uint _fee) onlyOwner private {
    //... existing code
}
```

By adding this modification, the `addPayout` function will only be accessible by the `creator` address, preventing unauthorized users from draining the contract's balance.",3429,279,12.620257377624512

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function, specifically in line 20:

require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);

This line allows any user to withdraw their balance, but it does not prevent the user from withdrawing more than their balance. The `require` statement checks if the requested amount is greater than or equal to the user's balance, but it does not prevent the user from requesting more than their balance. This could lead to a situation where a user is able to withdraw more funds than they have in their account, which is a serious security issue.

To fix this vulnerability, the `require` statement should be modified to ensure that the requested amount does not exceed the user's balance:

require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);

This change ensures that users can only withdraw up to the amount they have in their account, preventing the possibility of overdrawing their balance.",970,219,9.140315771102905
15,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The issue is that the `balanceOf` mapping is being updated with the `totalSupply` before the constructor function has finished executing. This can lead to a situation where the `balanceOf` mapping is accessible and modifiable by other contracts or functions before the contract is fully initialized, potentially leading to an attack where the balance can be manipulated.

To fix this vulnerability, the `balanceOf` mapping should be updated after the constructor function has finished executing. This can be done by moving the `balanceOf` update statement after the constructor function or by using a function to update the balance after the contract is fully initialized.",785,167,6.979066610336304

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `set` function (line 20) where any user can update the `map` array without any restrictions. This means that any user can overwrite the values in the `map` array, which could lead to unintended consequences or loss of data.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add an access control mechanism to restrict who can update the `map` array. One way to do this is by adding a modifier that checks if the caller is the owner of the contract. Here's an example of how you can modify the `set` function to add access control:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

19,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. The `onlyowner` modifier checks if the `msg.sender` is equal to the `owner`, which is fine for simple cases. However, the issue arises when the contract is used in conjunction with other contracts or libraries that use `tx.origin` for access control.

In this case, the `CustomToken` contract inherits from the `BaseToken` contract, which may have its own access control logic using `tx.origin`. If the `BaseToken` contract uses `tx.origin` and the `CustomToken` contract calls a function from the `BaseToken` contract, the `tx.origin` will be the original transaction initiator, not the `msg.sender` of the `CustomToken` contract. This can lead to unintended access control bypasses, allowing attackers to call functions that should only be accessible to the owner.

To fix this issue, it is recommended to use a more secure approach for access control, such as using a whitelist of authorized addresses or implementing a more robust access control system that does not rely on `tx.right`.",771,261,10.802920579910278

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `msg.sender` in the `initWallet` function without proper access control. This allows any user to set the `creator` address, which is then used as a guard in the `migrateTo` function to prevent the creator from transferring the contract's balance to another address. If an attacker can set the `creator` to their own address, they can bypass this restriction and transfer the contract's funds.",997,111,4.743797779083252

This could potentially lead to an access control issue if the address 0xD5F8fEd6F45A4a82E54e4D922C7F050B18566Cab is not properly controlled or if it is a contract that could be manipulated by an attacker.

Additionally, the contract does not have any access control mechanisms in place to restrict who can call the functions or modify the contract's state. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the contract's data.",662,223,9.247490882873535
24,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The `changeOwner` function in the `Unprotected` contract allows the owner to be changed, but there is no mechanism in place to prevent the `CustomToken` contract from calling the `changeOwner` function and changing the owner of the `Unprotected` contract.

In the `CustomToken` constructor, the `Transfer` event is emitted, which is not a vulnerability itself. However, if the `Transfer` event is used to call the `changeOwner` function in the `Unprotected` contract, it would allow an attacker to change the owner of the `Unprotected` contract by interacting with the `CustomToken` contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `changeOwner` function should be made private or removed, and the owner should be set in the constructor of the `Unprotected` contract. Additionally, the `CustomToken` contract should not have the ability to call the `changeOwner` function.",766,233,9.69937801361084

26,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in both the `withdraw` and fallback functions. The `delegatecall` function allows a contract to execute another contract's code in the context of the calling contract, which can lead to unintended behavior if not properly secured.

In the `withdraw` function, the `delegatecall` is used to call the `setFibonacci` function of the `fibonacciLibrary` contract. However, this does not provide any access control, as any contract can call the `fibonacciLibrary` and potentially change the `calculatedFibNumber` value. This could lead to incorrect balances being transferred to the user.

Similarly, in the fallback function, the `delegatecall` is used to call the `msg.data` of the calling contract. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the `FibonacciBalance` contract, potentially leading to unautrightful access or manipulation of the contract's state.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to unchecked low-level calls. The vulnerability lies in the `sendMoney` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
_target.call.value(_value)(_data);

This line uses the low-level `call.value` function to send Ether and execute arbitrary code on the `_target` address. The potential issue is that the return value of this function is not checked. If the call fails, the function will not revert the transaction, and the execution will continue. This can lead to fail-open situations and other unwanted outcomes.

To fix this vulnerability, the return value of the `call.value` function should be checked, and the transaction should be reverted if the call fails. Here's an example of how to fix the `sendMoney` function:

The issue arises when the `totalSupply` value is too large to be represented by the `uint256` data type. In this case, the `totalSupply` is set to `10000000000000000000000000000`, which is a very large number. If the `totalSupply` value exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by `uint256`, it will cause an integer overflow, leading to incorrect balances and potentially allowing attackers to manipulate the contract's state.

If the `_secondsToIncrease` value is large enough, it could cause an integer overflow, leading to unexpected behavior.

In Solidity, the `uint` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When an overflow occurs, the value wraps around to zero. This can lead to situations where the lock time is set to zero or a very small value, allowing the user to withdraw their funds earlier than intended.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflows and underflows. Here's an example of how you can modify the `increaseLockTime` function to use SafeMath:

Specifically, the line `count -= input;` can cause an underflow if the `input` is greater than the current value of `count`. In Solidity version 0.4.23, there is no built-in overflow or underflow checking, which means that if `count` is 1 and `input` is 2, the resulting `count` would be -1, which is not a valid value for a `uint256` type.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the `count` variable, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or even loss of funds if the contract interacts with other contracts or functions that rely on the correct value of `count`.",721,193,8.043192625045776
84,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the constructor function `CustomToken()`. The line `balanceOf[0xD5F8fEd6F45A4a82E54e4D922C7F050B18566Cab] = totalSupply;` is vulnerable to integer overflow.

In Solidity, when assigning a value to a mapping, the right-hand side of the assignment is implicitly converted to the type of the mapping's value type. In this case, the `balanceOf` mapping has a value type of `uint256`. The `totalSupply` variable is also of type `uint256`.

However, the issue arises when the `totalSupply` value is implicitly converted to the `balanceOf` mapping's value type. If the `totalSupply` value is too large, it can cause an integer overflow during the conversion, leading to an incorrect balance value being assigned to the address `0xD5F8fEd6F45A4a82E5EE4D922C7F050B18566Cab`.

85,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the `CustomToken()` constructor function. The issue is with the following line:

```solidity
balanceOf[0xD5F8fEd6F45A4a82E54e4D922C7F050B18566Cab] = totalSupply;
```

Here, the `balanceOf` mapping is being set to the `totalSupply` value, which is a very large number (100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000). If the `balanceOf` mapping is not initialized to handle such a large number, it may cause an integer overflow when trying to store this value.

Additionally, the `Transfer` event is emitted with the `totalSupply` value, which could also cause an integer overflow if the event parameters are not properly handled.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `balanceOf` mapping and event parameters can handle large numbers without causing an integer overflow.",701,270,11.140138149261475

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow due to the use of Solidity version 0.4.23, which does not have built-in overflow checks. The vulnerability lies in the same lines as the previous code:

- Line 18: count += input;
- Line 24: count *= input;
- Line 30: count -= input;
- Line 36: uint res = count + input;
- Line 42: uint res = count * input;
- Line 48: uint res = count - input;

These operations can lead to unexpected results if the input value causes the count to exceed the maximum value of a uint256 or go below zero. This can be exploited by attackers to manipulate the contract's state or cause denial of service.",1037,190,7.993974685668945

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the same type of arithmetic overflow issue as the first contract. The vulnerability lies in the `transfer` function, specifically in the lines:

```solidity
require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
```

In Solidity version 0.4.18, the `uint` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When subtracting `_value` from `balances[msg.sender]`, if the result is less than 0, it will wrap around to a very large positive number due to the nature of unsigned integer arithmetic. This can lead to an incorrect balance update and potentially allow the attacker to drain funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflows and underflows. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath in the `transfer` function:

```solidity
import ""https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol"";

The vulnerability lies in the `CustomToken` contract, specifically in the `CustomToken()` constructor function. The line `balanceOf[0xD5F8fEd6F45A4a82E54e4D922C7F050B18566Cab] = totalSupply;` is vulnerable to integer overflow.

In Solidity, when assigning a value to a variable, if the value is larger than the maximum value that the variable can hold, it will wrap around to the minimum value. In this case, the `balanceOf` mapping is of type `uint256`, which can hold a maximum value of 2^256 - 1. The `totalSupply` is set to 10000000000000000000000000000, which is less than the maximum value of `uint256`. However, the `balanceOf` mapping is not directly affected by the `totalSupply` value.

The vulnerability arises when the `balanceOf` mapping is accessed and modified using the `Transfer` event. The `Transfer` event is triggered with the parameters `address(0), 0xD5F8",607,301,12.365460395812988

The vulnerability lies in the `add` function of the `Overflow` contract. In Solidity version 0.4.15, the `+=` operator does not check for overflows or underflows. If the result of the addition exceeds the maximum value of a uint (2^256 - 1), it will wrap around to 0, leading to an incorrect balance.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflows and underflows. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath in the `Overflow` contract:

If the addition of `_value` to `balanceOf[_to]` results in a value that exceeds the maximum value of a uint256 (which is 2^256 - 1), it will wrap around to 0, leading to an incorrect balance and potentially allowing for funds to be stolen.

In the `CustomToken` contract, the `transfer` function is not overridden, so it uses the `transfer` function from the `IntegerOverflowAdd` contract. This means that the integer overflow vulnerability is present in the `CustomToken` contract as well.",700,176,7.319513320922852
91,bad randomness," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of blockhash for randomness. The blockhash function returns the hash of a block, which is predictable to some extent. Miners have the ability to influence the blockchain, and they can potentially predict or manipulate the blockhash values. This predictability can be exploited by a malicious user who can observe the blockchain and guess the blockhash that will be used in the settle function.

In the settle function, the contract checks if the guessed hash matches the actual blockhash of the block number that was locked in by the user. If a malicious user can predict or influence the blockhash, they can lock in a guess that will likely match the blockhash of a future block, allowing them to win the challenge and receive the 2 ether reward.

To fix this vulnerability, a more secure source of randomness should be used, such as a decentralized randomness oracle or a commit-reveal scheme that relies on cryptographic techniques to ensure unpredictability and fairness.",1047,228,9.54495358467102

The vulnerability lies in the use of block.coinbase and block.difficulty as sources of randomness. These values are predictable and can be influenced by miners, making the randomness not truly random. This can be exploited by a malicious user to predict the outcome of the raffle and potentially manipulate the results.

Additionally, the use of block.number as a source of randomness is also problematic. The block number is predictable and can be influenced by miners, which can lead to predictable outcomes in the raffle.

93,bad randomness," YES, the code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the randomness generation function `rand(uint max)`. The function uses the block hash of the last block to generate a pseudo-random number. However, block hashes are not truly random and can be influenced by miners. This means that a miner with enough computational power could potentially predict the outcome of the `rand` function, leading to an unfair advantage in the game.

Additionally, the function uses a fixed factor `FACTOR` and a fixed number of unpaid entries to calculate the random number. This could potentially lead to a situation where the same index is chosen multiple times, resulting in the same user receiving multiple payouts.

To fix this vulnerability, a more secure random number generation method should be used, such as the OPRNG (Open Predecessor Random Number Generator) or the RANDAUF (Randomness from Unpredictable Sources) algorithm.

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. In this case, the Collect function is vulnerable to reentrancy because it allows the external contract to call the Put function before the balance is deducted.

An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the Collect function and then calls the Put function, effectively stealing funds from the contract. The malicious contract can keep calling the Put function until the balance is depleted, and then proceed to call the Collect function to withdraw the funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the state (deduct the balance) before making external calls. Here's an example of how the Collect function can be modified to prevent reentrancy:

126,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function of the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract. The issue is that the contract allows external calls to be made before the state of the contract is updated. In this case, the `userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;` line is executed after the external call, which means that if the external call is a reentrant call, it can withdraw the balance again before the balance is updated to zero.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the state before making any external calls. Here's an example of how the `withdrawBalance` function can be modified to prevent reentrancy attacks:

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `resetInvestment` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp+ONE_MINUTE)

This line checks if the current block timestamp is at least one minute after the `lastInvestmentTimestamp`. However, miners have the ability to manipulate the block timestamp within a certain range (usually 15 seconds). This means that an attacker could potentially mine a block with a timestamp that is just under one minute after the `lastInvestmentTimestamp`, bypassing the time check and triggering the `resetInvestment` function.

As a result, the attacker could drain the `jackpot` funds by calling the `resetInvestment` function before the intended time, exploiting the time manipulation vulnerability.",1244,199,8.365657806396484

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. An attacker can repeatedly call the `addCreditors` function to fill the `creditorAddresses` array until it reaches a size of 1500. Once this happens, the `emptyCreditors` function will be triggered, which clears the `creditorAddresses` array and sets the `win` variable to true. This can be exploited to disrupt the normal operation of the contract by repeatedly triggering the `emptyCreditors` function, effectively denying service to legitimate users.",988,139,5.895406246185303
134,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the contract attempts to dynamically resize the `array` if the `numElements` is equal to the current length of the `array`.

In Solidity, arrays are fixed-size data structures, and their size cannot be changed once they are initialized. The line `array.length += 1;` is attempting to change the size of the array, which is not allowed in Solidity and will result in a compilation error.

However, even if this line were to be removed, the `insertNnumbers` function would still be vulnerable to a DoS attack. The function iterates over the `numbers` parameter and inserts the `value` into the `array` for each iteration. If an attacker sends a transaction with a very large `numbers` value, the function will consume a significant amount of gas, potentially leading to a denial of service.

To fix this vulnerability, you can either limit the maximum number of elements that can be inserted into the `array` or use a dynamic data structure like a mapping or a list that can handle a larger number of elements without consuming excessive gas.",1115,275,11.428788661956787

The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function, specifically in line 24:

```solidity
require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));

This line attempts to send Ether to the addresses stored in `refundAddresses`. The `send` function is a low-level transfer function that can fail for various reasons, such as the recipient's account being empty or the transaction running out of gas. If any of the `send` calls fail, the entire `refundAll` function will fail due to the `require` statement, causing a denial of service.

In a denial of service attack, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by calling the `refundAll` function and causing it to fail, preventing legitimate refunds from being processed. This can be done by either providing an invalid Ethereum address or by manipulating the recipient's account to be empty or have insufficient gas.

To mitigate this vulnerability, consider using the `transfer` function instead of `send`, as it has better gas handling and will not fail if the recipient's account is empty. Additionally, you can implement checks to ensure that the recipient's account",1015,301,12.492539882659912

The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function of the `DosOneFunc` contract. An attacker can repeatedly call this function, causing the `listAddresses` array to fill up with the attacker's address. Once the array reaches its maximum size of 1500, the function will clear the array by setting it to a new empty array. This process can be repeated indefinitely, causing the contract to consume resources and potentially leading to a Denial of Service condition.

In a Denial of Service attack, the contract becomes unresponsive or slow to respond to legitimate users, as it is constantly processing the attacker's transactions. This can lead to a negative user experience and may even result in users losing trust in the contract or the platform.

To mitigate this vulnerability, consider implementing rate limiting or other access control mechanisms to prevent an attacker from repeatedly calling the `ifillArray` function.",833,227,9.425929307937622
