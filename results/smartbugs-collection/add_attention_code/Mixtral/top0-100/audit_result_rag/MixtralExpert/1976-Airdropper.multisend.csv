However, the `onlyOwner` modifier is defined in the `Ownable` contract, and it is not inherited by the `Airdropper` contract. Therefore, the `onlyOwner` modifier in the `multisend` function does not have any effect, and any address can call this function.

So, my answer is 'YES' and the vulnerability is related to 'access control'. The `Airdropper` contract should inherit the `Ownable` contract to properly use the `onlyOwner` modifier for access control.",1003,158,14.544242143630981

However, in the provided code, the `onlyowner` modifier checks against `creator`, which is set in the constructor, so the contract is not vulnerable at line 24 specifically.

This is different from the `onlyowner` modifier used in the `Missing` contract, where the owner is set in the constructor but can be changed by any address. In the `Airdropper` contract, the owner can only be set by the deploying address, and the `onlyOwner` modifier uses `revert()` to reject any calls from non-owners.

20,access control," The answer is YES, the contract Airdropper is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the function `multisend` of the contract Airdropper. The function uses the `onlyOwner` modifier which is a good practice. However, the modifier onlyOwner in this case is applied to the function in the contract Airdropper and not in the inherited contract Ownable. This means that the access control check is performed against the contract Airdropper's address and not the original owner address. Therefore, any user can call the function `multisend` as long as they have the contract Airdropper's address. To fix this issue, the modifier onlyOwner should be declared in the contract Ownable and inherited by the contract Airdropper.",900,169,15.441964149475098
21,access control," The answer is YES, the contract Airdropper is vulnerable to access control issues.

The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract, which uses the `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict access to the function. However, the `onlyOwner` modifier checks the `msg.sender` against the `owner` address, which can be manipulated by an attacker who has previously become the `caller` of the `Airdropper` contract.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can first call the `sendTo` function of the `MyContract` contract, which sets the `tx.origin` to the attacker's address. Then, the attacker can call the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract, which will check the `msg.sender` (the `Airdropper` contract) against the `owner` address, and find that they match. Therefore, the `multisend` function will be executed, allowing the attacker to transfer tokens to any address of their choice.

To fix this vulnerability, the `onlyOwner` modifier should check the `msg.sender` against the `tx.origin` instead of the `msg.sender`. This will ensure that the `multisend` function is only executed by the true owner of the `Airdrop",633,301,26.919631004333496

The `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract has the `onlyOwner` modifier, which restricts its access to the owner of the contract. Therefore, only the owner can call this function and perform the specified actions. However, it's important to note that the `onlyOwner` modifier is defined in the `Ownable` contract, and the `Airdropper` contract inherits it.

The function uses `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict the function, which is a good practice. However, the function itself is not secure. It does not check if the `_tokenAddr` is a valid ERC20 token contract or not. An attacker can provide the address of a malicious contract which can then steal funds, revert transactions, or perform other malicious activities. Additionally, the function calls the `transfer` function of the `_tokenAddr` contract in a loop without checking the return value.

26,access control," Answer:

Yes, the smart contract code is vulnerable due to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the fact that there is no access control checks in the `withdraw` function of the `FibonacciBalance` contract. This means that any user can call this function and withdraw funds, even if they are not authorized to do so. The `delegatecall` function is used, which allows the calling contract to execute the code of the called contract, but with the context of the calling contract. This can lead to a number of issues, including access control issues. The `delegatecall` function should be used with caution and only when necessary. In this case, it is not necessary and introduces unnecessary risk.

Additionally, the `FibonacciLib` contract does not have any modifier restricting access to its functions, making them public by default. This means that any user can call these functions and potentially manipulate the state of the contract.

Furthermore, the contract `Airdropper` is not used in the `FibonacciBalance` contract, but it is also vulnerable to access control issues. The `multisend` function is restricted by the `onlyOwner` modifier, but the `owner` variable is never set, making it impossible to restrict access to the function.

However, the second code snippet has its own vulnerabilities. The `multisend` function uses a `while` loop to transfer tokens to multiple addresses, but it does not check for potential re-entrancy attacks. Additionally, the function does not check for integer overflows or underflows when calculating the token amounts to be transferred.

Overall, while the second code snippet is not vulnerable to the same issue as the first one, it still has its own potential vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.",2139,200,18.498772621154785
56,unchecked low level calls," Answer:

YES, the second smart contract code is also vulnerable. The vulnerability exists in the Airdropper contract in the multisend function. The function calls the transfer function of the ERC20 contract without checking its return value. If the transfer fails for any reason (like insufficient balance), the contract will continue executing the rest of the code, leading to potential issues. The potential vulnerability is similar to the one described in the 'unchecked low level calls' category.",753,105,9.850718021392822
57,unchecked low level calls," Yes, the smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. In this function, the `transfer` function of the `ERC20` contract is called in a loop without checking the return value. If the `transfer` function fails for any reason (for example, if the sender does not have enough tokens), the contract will continue to execute the loop and may cause unintended behavior or even fail. This is the same type of vulnerability as in the first code snippet, where the `transfer` function is called without checking the return value in the `VaultProxy` contract.",1060,141,13.111997127532959
58,unchecked low level calls," Yes, the second smart contract code is also vulnerable. The vulnerability exists in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract.

If the `transfer` function fails, the contract will continue executing the rest of the loop, potentially transferring incorrect or unwanted amounts. The `transfer` function could fail due to various reasons, such as insufficient balance or an error in the `ERC20` contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `multisend` function should check the return value of the `transfer` function and revert the transaction if any transfer fails:

```solidity
while (i < dests.length) {
    bool success = ERC20(_tokenAddr).transfer(dests[i], 10**15 * values[i]);
    require(success, ""Transfer failed."");
    i += 1;
}
```

This way, if any transfer fails, the entire transaction will be reverted, preventing further incorrect or unwanted transfers.",747,252,22.746044874191284
59,unchecked low level calls," Answer:

NO, the second code snippet is not vulnerable to the same 'unchecked-send' vulnerability. This is because the 'Command' function in the second contract checks the return value of the 'call' function, as shown in line 51:

`if (!adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)) { revert(); }`

This check ensures that if the 'call' function fails, the contract will not continue executing and will instead revert. This is a good practice to prevent fail-opens and other unwanted outcomes.

However, the second contract has other vulnerabilities, such as the lack of checks on the 'dests' and 'values' arrays in the'multisend' function. These vulnerabilities are not related to the 'unchecked-send' vulnerability and would require separate analysis.",2153,184,17.110124588012695
60,unchecked low level calls," The provided code is vulnerable, and the vulnerability exists in the `Airdropper` contract. The `multisend` function uses `.transfer()` to transfer tokens, but it does not check the return value to see if the transfer was successful. If the transfer fails for any reason (e.g., insufficient balance), the function will continue to execute, potentially allowing the contract to continue in an inconsistent state.

Additionally, the `callAddress` function from the `Caller` contract is inherited by the `Airdropper` contract, and it contains the same vulnerability as the original code. It uses the low-level `.call()` function without checking the return value, which can cause the contract to continue executing even if the call fails.

In summary, the vulnerabilities in the `multisend` function and the `callAddress` function (inherited from `Caller`) are due to the lack of return value checks after making external calls. This can lead to fail-opens and other unwanted outcomes if the external calls fail.",544,228,20.695263147354126

2. In the `callSecondTarget()` function: `secondTarget.call.value(msg.value)();`
3. In the `winPrize()` function: `owner.call.value(1 wei)();`

The reason for this vulnerability is that the low-level functions `call()`, `callcode()`, `delegatecall()`, and `send()` do not propagate errors and will not lead to a total reversion of the current execution. If the return value of such low-level calls is not checked, it can lead to fail-opens and other unwanted outcomes.",2563,188,17.51633310317993

The contract Airdropper does not contain the same vulnerability as the previous contract. It does not use the low-level function call.value() without checking the return value. Instead, it uses the high-level function transfer() of the ERC20 contract, which will propagate errors and bubble up. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the same type of attack.

However, it is important to note that the Airdropper contract has its own potential vulnerabilities. For example, the multisend function uses a while loop to iterate over arrays, which can cause a problem if the arrays are not of the same length or if they contain invalid addresses. Additionally, the function does not check for overflows or underflows when performing arithmetic operations. Therefore, it is important to continue auditing the contract and checking for other potential vulnerabilities.",863,186,16.990641355514526

In this function, the `transfer` function of the `ERC20` contract is called in a loop without checking the return value. If any transfer fails, the loop will continue, and the contract will not be aware of the failure. This can lead to a fail-open situation, where the contract continues to execute even when it should have stopped.

In the given code, the Airdropper contract does not contain any low-level calls, so it is not vulnerable based on the provided vulnerability type. However, it is important to note that the Airdropper contract has other potential issues:

1. It uses `send()` in the `multisend` function, which can also fail silently. It is recommended to use `transfer()` instead.
2. The `multisend` function uses `10**15 * values[i]` to calculate the transfer amount. If `values[i]` is too large, it can result in an integer overflow, leading to a security vulnerability.

To address these issues, consider updating the `multisend` function as follows:

```solidity
function multisend(address _tokenAddr, address[] memory dests, uint256[] memory values)
    onlyOwner
    public
    returns (uint256) {
        uint256 i = 0;

The potential issue here is that the `transfer` function of the `ERC20` contract may fail, but the code continues to execute, potentially causing inconsistencies or incorrect behavior. The `transfer` function could fail due to various reasons, such as insufficient token balance, an event emission failure, or any other reason defined in the `ERC20` contract.

To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to follow best practices and check the return value of the `transfer` function. If the transfer fails, an error message can be displayed, or the function can be reverted using `revert()`. Here's an example of how to modify the code to include error handling:

This means that they could potentially manipulate the outcome of the random number generation in their favor.

Additionally, the use of `now` (which is equivalent to `block.timestamp`) as a source of randomness is also problematic, as it is subject to manipulation by miners.

98,reentrancy," Answer:

Yes, the first smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawFunds` function, specifically in the line `require(msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)());`. This line allows the recipient of the funds to execute arbitrary code before the `balances` mapping is updated, which can lead to a reentrancy attack.

The second smart contract code is not vulnerable to a reentrancy attack in the provided state, as it does not allow arbitrary code execution after the balance update. However, it is important to note that the `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract can still be vulnerable to other types of attacks, such as integer overflows or underflows, if the `dests` and `values` arrays are not properly checked for length and validity.",922,190,17.335651636123657
99,reentrancy," Yes, the provided DEP_BANK contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function, specifically in the line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())`. This line allows the recipient of the funds to call an arbitrary function, which can lead to a reentrancy attack if the recipient is a malicious contract. This is because the contract's state can change in the middle of its execution due to the external call, allowing for the attack.

The provided Airdropper contract, on the other hand, does not contain the same vulnerability. It is not vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because it does not allow arbitrary external calls in a way that could lead to a change in state during execution. However, it is important to note that the contract is still an incomplete implementation of the ERC20 standard and lacks important functions such as `balanceOf`, `totalSupply`, and `allowance`.",1459,208,19.013394594192505
100,reentrancy," Yes, the second smart contract code is also vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability exists in the `Airdropper` contract, specifically in the `multisend` function. The function calls an external contract's function (`transfer` from the `ERC20` contract) in a loop, without checking its return value. An attacker could exploit this by creating a malicious ERC20 contract that allows for reentrancy, which could lead to the unintended transfer of funds.

To fix this issue, you should implement a reentrancy guard pattern, which ensures that a contract function cannot be called while it is still executing. Additionally, you should check the return value of the external call to ensure it was successful before proceeding with the rest of the function's logic.",814,174,15.866506099700928
101,reentrancy," Yes, the second smart contract code is also vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability exists in the `Airdropper` contract, specifically in the `multisend` function. The function calls an external contract's function (`ERC20(tokenAddr).transfer`) without checking its return value, allowing for potential reentrancy attacks. The `transfer` function can call back into the `Airdropper` contract, changing its state before the `multisend` function has finished executing.

To mitigate this issue, you should follow the steps outlined in the original auditing guide, specifically step 4, which covers reentrancy attacks. In this case, you should check the return value of the `transfer` function and ensure that the state change in the `Airdropper` contract only occurs after the external function has finished executing.",750,186,16.94699192047119
102,reentrancy," Yes, the smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function, specifically at `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`.

After calling `withdrawReward(recipient)`, the state of the contract changes, and the recipient address can call the `getFirstWithdrawalBonus` function again before the initial execution is complete, leading to a reentrancy attack.

The `Airdropper` contract is not directly vulnerable in this example, but it is essential to follow best practices and ensure that all contracts are secure and do not indirectly expose vulnerabilities through their interactions with other contracts.",905,146,13.515923023223877
105,reentrancy," Answer:

Yes, the first contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())` in the `Collect` function. This line allows a malicious contract to call the `Collect` function again before the balance of the calling contract has been updated, which can lead to the malicious contract draining the contract of its funds.

The second contract code is not provided for review, so I cannot answer whether it is vulnerable or not.",1589,114,10.796699047088623
106,reentrancy," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function where it calls the `msg.sender` contract before the state of the current contract has been updated. This allows the called contract to modify the state of the current contract in a way that is not expected, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. Specifically, the `call.value(_am)()` line is where the reentrancy attack can occur.",1569,99,9.483865737915039
107,reentrancy," Answer:

Yes, the first contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function, specifically at `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())`. This line allows for a call to the sender's contract before the current function call is complete, which can lead to a reentrancy attack.

The second contract code does not have the same vulnerability because it does not use `call.value` in a way that allows for a reentrancy attack. However, it is important to note that this contract has other issues, such as the lack of a reentrancy guard in the `multisend` function. This could potentially be exploited in a different way.",1387,157,14.511062383651733
108,reentrancy," Answer:

NO, the second smart contract code is not vulnerable to the reentrancy attack based on the provided code snippet. The reason is that the `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract does not modify the contract's state after calling an external function `transfer` in the `ERC20` contract. Therefore, there is no risk of reentrancy attacks. However, it is essential to note that the `transfer` function in the `ERC20` contract could still be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks if it is not implemented correctly.",1513,125,11.747109413146973
109,reentrancy," The smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `ModifierEntrancy` contract, in the `airDrop()` function.

112,reentrancy," Yes, the second smart contract code is also vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability exists in the `Airdropper` contract, specifically in the `multisend` function. The function calls an external contract's function (`transfer` of `ERC20` contract) in a way that allows the external contract to call back into the `Airdropper` contract before the `multisend` function execution is complete. This can lead to the reentrancy attack.

The reason for this vulnerability is the same as in the first contract: the untrusted external contract's function call is not properly secured, allowing for potential reentrancy attacks. To fix this issue, consider using the 'checks-effects-interactions' pattern, where you perform checks and state modifications before calling external functions. This pattern ensures that the contract state is not changed in the middle of execution due to external calls.",785,198,18.065566301345825
113,reentrancy," Answer:

YES, the second smart contract code is also vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability exists in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. The function calls an external contract's function (`transfer` function of the `ERC20` contract) in a loop without checking its return value, which may allow an attacker to repeatedly call the `multisend` function and drain the contract of funds.

The second smart contract code is not vulnerable to a reentrancy attack, as it includes proper access control measures. The `multisend` function is restricted to the owner of the contract, as indicated by the `onlyOwner` modifier.

117,reentrancy," Answer:

Yes, the first contract (Reentrancy\_cross\_function) is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function, specifically in this line: `(bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""");`. This line allows the caller's code to be executed before the `withdrawBalance` function's execution is complete, which can result in the contract state being changed in the middle of execution due to a call to an untrusted contract.

The second contract (Airdropper) is not vulnerable to a reentrancy attack as it does not have a function that changes the contract state and calls an external contract in the same function call. However, it is important to note that the `multisend` function calls an external contract's function (`transfer` from the ERC20 contract) in a loop, which could potentially cause the contract to run out of gas if the `dests` array is too long. It is recommended to add a check for the array length to ensure that it does not exceed the gas limit.",832,243,21.980390787124634
118,reentrancy," Answer:

YES, the given contract code is vulnerable to Reentrancy attack. The vulnerability exists in the `withdrawBalance()` function of the `Reentrance` contract. The function uses `msg.sender.call.value(userBalance[msg.sender])()` which allows external contract calls to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete, leading to a Reentrancy attack.

In addition, the `multisend()` function in the `Airdropper` contract also suffers from the same issue. It calls the `transfer()` function of the `ERC20` contract without checking its return value, which can result in the same Reentrancy attack.",764,155,14.244898557662964
119,reentrancy," Answer:

Yes, the first contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `CashOut` function, specifically in the line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())`. This line allows for a call to an arbitrary address before the state of the contract has been updated, which means that the contract balance can be manipulated by an external contract. This is a classic example of a reentrancy attack.

The second contract code, on the other hand, does not have this vulnerability. The `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract uses the `transfer` function from the `ERC20` contract, which does not allow for arbitrary calls to external contracts.

126,reentrancy," The answer is:

NO, the second smart contract code is not vulnerable to the reentrancy attack based on the provided code.

The reason is that the `withdrawBalance` function in the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract is still vulnerable to the reentrancy attack, but the `Airdropper` contract, which is the contract that calls the `transfer` function of the `ERC20` contract, does not inherit from the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract. Therefore, the `withdrawBalance` function is not called within the `Airdropper` contract, and the reentrancy attack cannot be executed through the `Airdropper` contract.

However, it is important to note that if the `withdrawBalance` function were to be called within the `Airdropper` contract or any other contract that inherits from `Reentrancy_insecure`, then it would still be vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. It is always important to ensure that all contracts are secure and do not inherit vulnerabilities from other contracts.",711,231,20.890805959701538
127,time manipulation," Yes, the provided code is vulnerable to timestamp manipulation. The `isSaleFinished` function in the `TimedCrowdsale` contract relies solely on the `block.timestamp` to determine if the sale has finished, which can be manipulated by the miner.

Additionally, the `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract does not have any checks for the `_tokenAddr` contract's `transfer` function's return value, which can lead to vulnerabilities if the `transfer` function fails.

Furthermore, the `multisend` function uses `i` as the loop counter without checking for any upper limit, which can cause the contract to run out of gas if the `dests` array is too long.

Therefore, the code has multiple vulnerabilities and should be thoroughly audited and tested before deployment.",603,191,17.364959239959717
128,time manipulation," Yes, the smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the line 8: `if ( rand> 0 && now - rand > 24 hours ) {` and line 16: `return block.timestamp;`. The contract is using `block.timestamp` for critical functionality, which can be manipulated by miners. Additionally, the contract is using `block.timestamp` in the generation of random numbers, which can lead to a 'bad randomness' vulnerability.

Furthermore, the contract is using `now` which is an alias for `block.timestamp` and it's not recommended to use it for critical functionality.

Additionally, the contract does not check the return value of the `transfer` function in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract, which can lead to vulnerabilities.

Another thing to note is that the contract is using solidity version 0.4.0, which is outdated and has known security vulnerabilities. It's recommended to use the latest version of solidity.

Overall, the contract should be thoroughly tested and audited by a professional security team before deploying it to the mainnet.",878,265,23.997402667999268
129,time manipulation," Yes, the first smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The 'Governmental' contract sets the 'lastInvestmentTimestamp' variable to 'block.timestamp' in the 'invest' function. If an attacker can manipulate the block timestamp, they could potentially invest at the same 'lastInvestmentTimestamp' multiple times, causing the'resetInvestment' function to execute prematurely.

The second smart contract code is not vulnerable to time manipulation in the same way as the 'Governmental' contract because it does not use 'block.timestamp' to control the execution of any functions. However, it is important to note that the 'Airdropper' contract has its own potential vulnerabilities, unrelated to time manipulation. The'multisend' function calls the 'transfer' function of an external contract, which could potentially be malicious or have its own vulnerabilities. It is generally recommended to avoid calling external contract functions within critical parts of your contract, especially if you do not have control over the code of the external contract.",1156,228,20.761894941329956
130,time manipulation," Answer:

NO.

The provided code for the Airdropper contract does not have the same time manipulation vulnerability as the first Roulette contract. The Airdropper contract does not use the block timestamp or the alias now in its functions. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to time manipulation. However, it is important to note that the Airdropper contract has its own potential vulnerabilities, such as the lack of checks for arithmetic overflows and underflows, and the unchecked return values of the transfer function in the ERC20 contract.",730,124,11.510462284088135
131,time manipulation," Yes, the smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the line 18 of the `EtherLotto` contract:

`var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;`

The `block.timestamp` value is provided by the miner and can be manipulated within a certain range (can be off by a few seconds). In this case, the `random` value is generated based on this timestamp and used to determine the winner of the lottery. If a miner manipulates the timestamp, they can influence the outcome of the game, creating a vulnerability.",940,134,12.412584066390991
132,short addresses," Yes, the second smart contract code is also vulnerable due to the use of `tx.origin` in the `MyToken` contract. The `tx.origin` is the original address that started the transaction, and it can be manipulated in a similar way as the short address attacks explained in the first contract. It is generally recommended to use `msg.sender` instead of `tx.origin` to improve security. The `Airdropper` and `ERC20` contracts do not seem to have the vulnerability based on the provided code, but they are not using `tx.origin` or `msg.sender` in the given functions, so they are not directly related to the vulnerability.",950,148,13.642716407775879
133,denial of service," Answer:

YES, the smart contract code is vulnerable to denial of service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `emptyCreditors()` function of the `DosGas` contract. If the `emptyCreditors()` function is called when the `creditorAddresses` array has more than 1500 addresses, it will set the `creditorAddresses` array to a new array with zero elements and set `win` to true. This will result in losing all the addresses in the `creditorAddresses` array, and it can be used as a denial of service attack by repeatedly calling the `emptyCreditors()` function, making the contract unusable.

Additionally, the `multisend()` function in the `Airdropper` contract is also vulnerable to a DoS attack. An attacker can call this function with a large number of destinations and values, consuming a significant amount of gas and causing the contract to become unresponsive.

Therefore, it is recommended to modify the `emptyCreditors()` function to include a check to prevent it from being called repeatedly in a short period of time and limit the number of addresses that can be added or removed in a single transaction. Similarly, the `multisend()` function should also include a limit on the number of destinations and values that can be processed in a single transaction.",909,301,26.899394035339355
134,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. The function calls the `transfer` function of the `ERC20` contract in a loop, which can cause the contract to run out of gas if the `dests` array is too large. This can be exploited to deny service to other users of the contract. Additionally, the function does not check the length of the `dests` and `values` arrays against each other, which can lead to out-of-bounds errors and further security vulnerabilities.",1040,136,12.615812540054321
135,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract code is vulnerable due to the same reason as mentioned before. In the `lendGovernmentMoney` function, on lines 68 and 70, the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays are reset to a new array of size 0. This will cause all data stored in these arrays to be erased, effectively making it impossible for any future creditors to be paid out. This is a denial-of-service vulnerability, as it can be exploited to prevent the contract from fulfilling its intended function.

Additionally, the `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract is not called or used anywhere in the provided code, so it is unnecessary and can be removed to simplify the contract.",2428,170,15.927837133407593
136,denial of service," Yes, the second smart contract code is also vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack. The vulnerability exists in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. The function calls the `transfer` function of the `ERC20` contract in a loop, and if any of the calls to `transfer` fail, the entire function will fail due to the `revert` statement in the `onlyOwner` modifier. This means that if an attacker can manipulate any of the `dests` or `values` arrays to cause a failure in the `transfer` function, they can prevent the entire `multisend` function from executing, effectively causing a denial-of-service attack.

Here is the vulnerable code:
```scss
while (i < dests.length) {
   ERC20(_tokenAddr).transfer(dests[i], 10**15 * values[i]);
   i += 1;
}
```
To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a strategy similar to the `refundAll` function in the `Refunder` contract, where the function continues executing even if one of the `transfer` calls fails. This can be achieved by using a `for` loop with a `send` call instead of a `transfer` call, and checking for failures using `require`",924,301,26.946951627731323
137,denial of service," Yes, the second smart contract code is also vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability exists in the `Airdropper` contract, specifically in the `multisend` function. The function iterates over `dests` and `values` arrays using a `while` loop, and for each iteration, it transfers tokens from the `_tokenAddr` contract to the corresponding destination address. If the `dests` array is manipulated to contain the same address multiple times, or an attacker manages to register a large number of addresses, it could result in a denial of service attack. The function does not have a limit on the number of iterations it can perform, and it does not check for duplicate addresses in the `dests` array. This can lead to the contract running out of gas or being overwhelmed by the number of transactions, resulting in a denial of service.",756,190,17.303343057632446
138,denial of service," Yes, the second smart contract code is also vulnerable to denial of service attack. The vulnerability exists in the `Airdropper` contract. The `multisend` function uses a `while` loop to transfer tokens to multiple addresses, but it does not have a predefined limit for the loop. If the `dests` array is large enough, it can cause the contract to run out of gas and fail, resulting in a denial of service. The lack of a gas limit for this function can be exploited to cause a failure in token transfers, which could be detrimental to the users relying on the `Airdropper` contract.

In summary, the `Airdropper` contract's `multisend` function should have a predefined gas limit or a maximum number of iterations for the `while` loop to prevent potential gas exhaustion attacks.",742,189,17.2400541305542
