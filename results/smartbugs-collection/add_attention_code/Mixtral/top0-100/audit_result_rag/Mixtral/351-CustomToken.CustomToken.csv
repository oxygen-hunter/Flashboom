Based on the given code, the `CustomToken` contract is not vulnerable to arithmetic overflows or underflows. The only arithmetic operation in the code is the assignment of `totalSupply` to `balanceOf[0x5ebc4B61A0E0187d9a72Da21bfb8b45F519cb530]`, but this is a simple assignment and does not involve any arithmetic operations that could result in overflows or underflows.
