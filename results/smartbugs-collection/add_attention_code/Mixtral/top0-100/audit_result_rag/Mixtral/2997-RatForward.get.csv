83,arithmetic," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to integer overflows. The vulnerability is in the 'run' function where 'count' is being decremented by 'input'. If 'input' is larger than the current value of 'count', an integer overflow will occur, resulting in incorrect contract behavior or potential security vulnerabilities. In this specific contract, the 'get' function transfers all the contract's ether to three different addresses, so an integer overflow in the 'run' function could potentially allow an attacker to drain the contract of all its funds.",618,118,7.319509267807007
84,arithmetic," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to arithmetic overflows. In the `run` function, the subtraction `count - input` may result in an overflow if `input` is larger than `count`. This can lead to unexpected behavior or even security vulnerabilities.",521,60,3.931706666946411
85,arithmetic," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to arithmetic overflows. In the `run` function, the `count` variable is being decremented by `input` without checking for potential overflows.

In the 'add' function, the vulnerability is the same as in the previous example, where there is a possibility of integer overflow.",532,115,7.102991580963135
90,arithmetic," Yes, the second contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is similar to the first contract, but in this case, the vulnerability is introduced by the external calls to the transfer function in the get function. These external calls can cause the contract to run out of gas if the transferred amounts are large, but more importantly, they can cause integer overflows if the contract's balance is not checked before the transfer. This can lead to the contract transferring more ether than it has, resulting in a loss of funds for the contract owner.",599,111,6.921717643737793
91,bad randomness," NO.

The contract does not appear to have any vulnerabilities related to randomness or the use of blockhash.
