The code consists of two contracts: `BaseToken` and `CustomToken`. The `BaseToken` contract is a simple ERC20 token contract, while the `CustomToken` contract is derived from `BaseToken` and sets some initial values.

Based on the given code, the `CustomToken` contract is not vulnerable to arithmetic overflows or underflows.
