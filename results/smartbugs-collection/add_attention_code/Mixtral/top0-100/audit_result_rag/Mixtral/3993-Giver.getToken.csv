11,access control," Yes, the vulnerability lies in the `TestContract` contract's `withdrawAll` function. It allows the `msg.sender` to transfer all the contract's funds to themselves, regardless of whether they are an owner or not. This bypasses the access control checks implemented in the `MultiOwnable` contract.",986,70,4.377676725387573
12,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is in the `Giver` contract's `getToken` function. The `require` statement on line 11 in the `getToken` function checks that the message value is greater than 1,000,000 ether, but the function is marked as `external` and `payable`. This means that anyone can call the function and send any amount of ether to it. Since the function does not check the sender's address or the token ID before transferring the NFT, an attacker can call the function with any amount of ether and take control of any NFT owned by the `Missing` contract.",667,148,8.56550908088684
13,access control," YES, The vulnerability lies in the ""DynamicPyramid()"" function where the creator is set to msg.sender, allowing anyone to call it and become the contract creator. This bypasses the intended access control.",3250,48,4.065869569778442
14,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the ""getToken"" function in the ""Giver"" contract. The requirement for the msg.value to be greater than 1000000 ether is not checked against the sender's balance. This means that anyone can call the function and send any amount of ether, even if they don't have enough to cover the cost. This can lead to the contract running out of gas and failing to execute the transferFrom function. Additionally, the contract does not check the return value of the transferFrom function, which can lead to further vulnerabilities if the transfer fails.",863,135,7.919682264328003
15,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is in the ""IamMissing"" constructor where the owner is set to the msg.sender. This means that anyone can call the constructor and become the owner of the contract. In the given code, there is no check on the constructor's input, allowing anyone to set the contract's owner to any address they want. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as an attacker taking control of the contract and draining its funds.

In the second part of the code, there is a separate contract ""Giver"" that interacts with an ERC721 contract. This contract does not seem to be related to the vulnerability in the ""Missing"" contract. However, it does have its own vulnerabilities, such as the requirement that msg.value must be greater than 1000000 ether for the ""getToken"" function to execute. This is a high gas cost and can be exploited by attackers to deny service to legitimate users. Additionally, the ERC721 contract's transferFrom function is called without any checks on the input parameters, allowing anyone to transfer tokens that they do not own. These vulnerabilities should be addressed separately.",681,260,14.814878940582275
16,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the ""getToken"" function in the ""Giver"" contract. The requirement for the msg.value to be greater than 1000000 ether does not ensure that only the contract owner can call this function. An attacker can call this function and pay the required ether to transfer the ERC721 token, even if they are not the contract owner. This is an access control vulnerability.",771,102,5.480429410934448
17,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the use of `delegatecall` in the `forward` function of the `Proxy` contract. This function allows calling an external contract's function directly, bypassing the access control checks of the `Proxy` contract. In the given example, an attacker could call the `transferFrom` function of an ERC721 contract directly, bypassing the `getToken` function's requirement for a minimum ether value.",623,106,5.944700479507446
18,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the Wallet contract's PopBonusCode function where the array index is not checked against the actual length of the array. This can allow an attacker to access bonusCodes[bonusCodes.length] which is out of bounds and potentially manipulate the contract's state.

In the given Giver contract, it does not directly interact with the Wallet contract, so it is not directly affected by the vulnerability. However, if the Giver contract were to call the PopBonusCode function, it could potentially be exploited.",886,127,7.479958772659302
19,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is in the constructor function of the Missing contract. In the constructor function, the owner is set to the msg.sender, which means that the contract's owner can be changed to any address that calls the constructor function. This can lead to unintended consequences or malicious actions. In the given code, the Giver contract calls the constructor function of the Missing contract and transfers ownership to the msg.sender (which is the Giver contract itself), allowing the Giver contract to control the Missing contract. This can be exploited to perform unintended actions or drain the funds from the contract.",670,138,8.02746868133545
20,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the initWallet() function where the creator is set to msg.sender. This means that any user can call the initWallet() function and become the creator of the contract. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as allowing users to transfer the contract's balance or migrate it to their own address. In the given code, this vulnerability is exploited through the Giver contract's getToken() function, where users can transfer ERC721 tokens by paying a large enough ether amount.",883,120,7.076311826705933
21,access control," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is in the `MyContract` contract where the `sendTo` function checks the `tx.origin` instead of the `msg.sender`. This means that only the initial deployer of the contract can call the `sendTo` function, while everyone else can call the `MyContract` constructor and become the new owner. In the given code, the `Giver` contract can be used to exploit this vulnerability by sending ether to the `Giver` contract and receiving an ERC721 token in return, which can then be used to call the `sendTo` function and transfer funds from the `MyContract` contract.",616,147,8.530856847763062
22,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the ""getToken"" function of the ""Giver"" contract. The requirement for the msg.value to be greater than 1000000 ether is not checked against the sender's balance before the transferFrom function is called. This can allow an attacker to call the getToken function with less than 1000000 ether and still transfer the ERC721 token. Additionally, the ""deposit"" function in the ""Wallet"" contract has a similar issue where the balance check is not done before the deposit is made. This can allow an attacker to deposit more than their current balance.",917,148,8.614763975143433
23,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `SimpleSuicide` contract's `sudicideAnyone()` function, which allows any caller to execute the `selfdestruct()` function, potentially draining the contract of its funds. In the `Giver` contract, there is a function `getToken()` that calls `SimpleSuicide`'s `sudicideAnyone()` function and sends ether to it. An attacker could call `getToken()` with a malicious `msg.sender` address, causing the contract to send ether to the attacker and then execute the `selfdestruct()` function, draining the contract of its funds.",560,151,8.733508586883545
24,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The `changeOwner` function is marked as `public`, which means anyone can call it. However, it does not have any checks on the `_newOwner` address, so an attacker could call this function and set the contract owner to any address they want. This is a classic access control vulnerability. In the second part of the code, the `getToken` function in the `Giver` contract is also vulnerable to the same issue, as it does not check the address of the `_contract` before transferring the token.",671,121,7.087700128555298
25,access control," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to access control issues. The `withdrawAll` function in the `Phishable` contract uses `tx.origin` to check the caller's address, which can be easily bypassed by calling the function through a contract proxy or a contract with the `transfer` function. In the given `Giver` contract, an attacker can call the `getToken` function and provide the address of the `Phishable` contract and the token ID to steal all tokens. Instead, the `Phishable` contract should use the `msg.sender` or `_msgSender()` to check the caller's address.",648,141,8.196447372436523
26,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue lies in the use of `delegatecall` without proper checks on the returned data. In the `withdraw` and `fallback` functions, the contract calls the `fibonacciLibrary` contract using `delegatecall` without checking the returned data. This can allow an attacker to call arbitrary functions on the `fibonacciLibrary` contract and potentially steal funds or manipulate the contract state.",1244,95,5.793556213378906
27,unchecked low level calls," Yes, it is vulnerable due to the unchecked use of the 'adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)' function. This function can fail and return false, but the code continues to run without checking the return value. This can lead to unwanted outcomes, such as the transfer of funds to the wrong address or the execution of malicious code.",1886,75,4.912391185760498
28,unchecked low level calls," YES, the vulnerability lies in the unchecked return values of the send() function calls in lines 54 and 65. If the transfer fails, the contract will continue executing and potentially drain the contract of funds.",1706,49,3.403427839279175

31,unchecked low level calls," Yes, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability is similar to the one in the previous code snippet. The `caddress.call` function calls are not checked for failure. In this case, the contract is calling an ERC721 contract's `transferFrom` function, which can fail if the caller is not the owner of the token being transferred. If the `call` function fails, the contract will continue executing and not revert the transaction. This can lead to unwanted outcomes, such as tokens being transferred to unintended recipients or the contract continuing to execute even after a failure.",728,127,7.481102228164673
32,unchecked low level calls," YES, the vulnerability lies in the 'cash' function where the 'winner.send(subpot)' call does not check the return value, which can lead to the contract continuing execution even if the send fails. Similarly, in the constructor function, the'msg.sender.send(msg.value-value)' call also does not check the return value, which can lead to the contract continuing execution even if the send fails. This can result in the contract continuing to execute and potentially wasting resources or allowing an attacker to manipulate the contract state.",2931,118,8.031226634979248
33,unchecked low level calls," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `Giver` contract's `getToken` function, specifically in the line where the `transferFrom` function is called without checking its return value. If the `transferFrom` call fails (for example, if the sender does not have enough Ether or the token ID is invalid), the `getToken` function will continue executing and potentially allow the attacker to perform unintended actions. In this case, the `transferFrom` call should be wrapped in a `require` statement to ensure that it succeeds before continuing with the rest of the function.",590,132,7.685167551040649

Since the contract does not check the gas price before processing the transaction, a malicious user can front-run the contract by sending a higher gas price to preempt the original transaction and steal the bet.

Additionally, the contract does not properly check the return value of the ""send"" function, which can lead to the contract continuing execution even if the transaction fails. This can result in the contract continuing to delete the players array and resetting the game state, allowing the attacker to repeatedly steal bets.

The vulnerability is further exacerbated by the lack of access control in the ""getProfit"" function, which allows anyone to withdraw the contract's balance.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the contract should check the gas price before processing transactions, properly check the return value of the ""send"" function, and implement access control in the ""getProfit"" function. Additionally, the contract should use a more secure method for determining the winner, such as using a random number generator oracle.",1079,255,14.549758434295654
77,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is in the `Giver` contract's `getToken` function. The `require` statement checks that `msg.value` is greater than 1000000 ether, but it does not check for overflows when subtracting this value from the contract's balance. If a user sends more than the contract's balance in ether, it can result in an arithmetic overflow, allowing the user to transfer more tokens than the contract actually holds.",547,114,6.680548429489136
78,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is in the `Giver` contract's `getToken` function. The `require` statement checks that `msg.value` is greater than 1000000 ether, but it does not check for integer overflows when multiplying `msg.value` with the ether conversion rate (1 ether = 10^18 wei). An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing an input value that causes an integer overflow, allowing them to transfer Ether worth much more than intended.",514,124,7.201057195663452
79,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is not directly related to the Overflow_Add contract, but rather in the Giver contract. In the getToken function, there is no check for the returned value of the transferFrom function. If the transfer fails (for example, if the sender is not the owner of the token), the function will continue executing and transfer ether to the contract. This can lead to a denial of service or even theft of funds.

In the given code, the ERC721 contract's transferFrom function does not throw an exception when it fails, instead it returns a boolean value indicating success or failure. In the getToken function, this value is not checked, and the function continues executing regardless of the result. This can lead to the contract continuing to transfer ether even if the transfer fails, potentially draining the sender's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the getToken function should include a check for the success of the transferFrom function before continuing execution. This can be done by adding an assertion statement to check the returned boolean value. For example:

function getToken(address _contract, uint256 _tokenId) external payable {
 require(msg.value >= 1000000 ether);
 ERC721(_contract).transferFrom(ERC721(_contract).ownerOf(_tokenId",504,301,16.881661653518677
80,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is similar to the one in the previous code snippet. In this case, the vulnerability is in the `getToken` function of the `Giver` contract. The `count` variable in the `IntegerOverflowMinimal` contract was replaced with an external contract's `ownerOf` function call and a `transferFrom` function call. However, the logic of decrementing `count` by `input` is still present in the `run` function of the `IntegerOverflowMinimal` contract. This means that if `input` is large enough, it can cause an integer overflow, leading to potential security vulnerabilities or contract failure.",514,146,8.385730981826782
81,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the 'getToken' function in the 'Giver' contract. The requirement for msg.value to be greater than 1000000 ether can be bypassed by an attacker who sends a transaction with a higher nonce value. This would cause the contract to process the attacker's transaction before the one with the higher value, allowing the attacker to withdraw the ERC721 token with a lower value transaction. This is known as a'reentrancy attack'.",819,119,7.045778512954712
82,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the buy function where the require statement checks that msg.value equals numTokens * PRICE\_PER\_TOKEN. This check can lead to an integer overflow, as msg.value is a uint256 and numTokens and PRICE\_PER\_TOKEN can be arbitrarily large. If an attacker sends a value larger than the maximum representable value of a uint256, the contract will not enter the require statement and the balanceOf[msg.sender] will be incremented by an arbitrary number of tokens. This can lead to a loss of funds for the contract or other security issues.

Additionally, the sell function also has a similar vulnerability in the require statement that checks balanceOf[msg.sender] >= numTokens.

The Giver contract does not interact directly with the TokenSaleChallenge contract, so it is not directly affected by this vulnerability. However, it does have its own vulnerabilities, such as the lack of a check on the msg.value sent to the getToken function, which can allow an attacker to send any value they want and potentially steal ERC721 tokens.",949,250,14.21832275390625
83,arithmetic," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to arithmetic overflows. The vulnerability is in the `run` function where `count` is being subtracted from `input`.

85,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is similar to the one in the previous code snippet. The line ""count -= input;"" in the run function can lead to arithmetic overflows if the input is not carefully checked. In this case, the contract does not check the input, so an attacker can provide a value that causes an overflow, leading to unintended contract behavior or security vulnerabilities.

In the second contract snippet, the vulnerability is not directly related to the IntegerOverflowMultiTxOneFuncFeasible contract, but rather to the way it is used in the Giver contract. The Giver contract's getToken function calls the run function with the _tokenId as input, and since the _tokenId is not checked for validity, an attacker can provide an arbitrary value, potentially causing an overflow in the run function.

Therefore, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the lack of input validation in the run function of the IntegerOverflowMultiTxOneFuncFeasible contract and the way it is used in the getToken function of the Giver contract.",602,234,13.242679595947266

An attacker could repeatedly call this function, causing the contract to consume a significant amount of gas and potentially denying service to other users. Additionally, the contract does not check the sender's address or the number of tokens being transferred in the ""getToken"" function of the Giver contract, making it susceptible to other types of attacks as well.",1023,153,8.914591789245605
135,denial of service," Based on the given code, the smart contract is not vulnerable to denial of service attacks as described in the previous example. However, it does have other vulnerabilities and potential issues, such as the lack of access control checks on the `lendGovernmentMoney` function and the potential for integer overflows or underflows in arithmetic operations. It is important to thoroughly audit the entire contract to ensure its security and reliability.",2411,93,6.2533979415893555
136,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue lies in the Refunder contract's refundAll() function. The for loop iterates through all refundAddresses, and if any send() call fails, it will prevent all subsequent send() calls from executing. This creates a denial of service vulnerability, as a single failed send() call can prevent all refunds from being processed.",907,81,4.999697685241699
137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray()` function of the `DosOneFunc` contract. The function allows any address to add their address to the `listAddresses` array up to a length of 1500. An attacker can repeatedly call this function and fill up the array with their address, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by consuming all available storage on the contract. This can prevent other users from deploying or interacting with other contracts on the same address.

In the given code, the `Giver` contract is not directly related to the vulnerability in the `DosOneFunc` contract. However, if an attacker manages to fill up the `listAddresses` array in the `DosOneFunc` contract, they can cause a DoS attack on the `Giver` contract as well, as it relies on the `ERC721` contract's `ownerOf()` function, which requires storage to function properly.",739,223,12.707922458648682
138,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `DosAuction` contract's `bid()` function, specifically the line `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));`. This line calls the `send()` function of the `currentFrontrunner` address and sends it the `currentBid` amount. However, there is no check on whether `currentFrontrunner` has sufficient funds to cover the `currentBid` amount. This can allow an attacker to repeatedly call the `bid()` function with a lower bid than the current one, draining the funds of the `currentFrontrunner` address.

Additionally, the `Giver` contract's `getToken()` function requires a large ether amount as payment, but it does not check whether the caller has the required ERC721 token before transferring it. This can allow an attacker to call the `getToken()` function without having the required token, wasting the ether payment. However, this vulnerability is not directly related to the `DosAuction` contract and is a separate issue.",725,252,14.293664693832397
