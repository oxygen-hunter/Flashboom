11,access control," Yes, the vulnerability lies in the TestContract's constructor not initializing the root address in the MultiOwnable contract. This means that the root address in TestContract is not set to the deployer's address, allowing any address to call the onlyOwner-protected functions. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as the ability to call the withdrawAll function and drain the contract of funds.",834,85,5.184977054595947
12,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The `missing()` function sets the `owner` address to the `msg.sender` without any checks or verifications. This means that any address can call the `missing()` function and become the new owner of the contract. This bypasses the intended access control mechanism established by the `onlyowner` modifier. In the given code, the `BurnMe()` function is not relevant to the vulnerability.",515,97,5.783074140548706
13,access control," YES, The contract is vulnerable to the following access control issue:

The function `DynamicPyramid()` is marked as `public`, which means anyone can call it. In this function, the `creator` variable is set to the `msg.sender` address, effectively allowing anyone to set the contract owner. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as an attacker taking control of the contract and draining its funds.",3098,94,6.716927528381348
14,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the constructor function not being payable, which means it cannot be called with ether. An attacker can exploit this by deploying a malicious contract that mimics the Wallet contract and then calling the migrateTo function with the address of the original Wallet contract. Since the original Wallet contract's constructor is not payable, the attacker's contract will be the one that is executed instead, allowing the attacker to steal the funds from the original contract.",711,113,6.69880223274231
15,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue is with the constructor function `IamMissing()`. It sets the `owner` address to the `msg.sender` address, which is the address of the caller during the contract deployment. This means that the `owner` address is not under the control of the contract creator and can be set to any address during deployment. Therefore, the `onlyowner` modifier and the `withdraw()` function are not secure as they rely on the `owner` address being the contract creator's address.",529,114,6.6933372020721436
16,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `BurnMe` function, which has no access control checks. This means that any address can call it and cause the contract to self-destruct, potentially losing all funds in the contract.",619,55,3.4979934692382812
17,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue is with the use of `delegatecall` in the `forward` function. The `delegatecall` function can allow the called contract to modify the state of the calling contract if it is not used carefully. In this case, the `BurnMe` function in the called contract can be used to call `selfdestruct` on the Proxy contract, resulting in the loss of all funds in the contract.",471,95,5.656008720397949
18,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is similar to the previous one, but it affects the `PopBonusCode()` function. Since array indices are unsigned, the condition `0 <= bonusCodes.length` will always be true, allowing the function to decrement the array length even when it is already at zero. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as allowing an attacker to access or modify data they should not be able to.",734,97,5.858291864395142
19,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The constructor function should not be callable after the contract has been deployed. By keeping it public, anyone can call it and potentially take control of the contract. In this case, the constructor function contains the assignment of the 'owner' variable, so an attacker could change the owner address. A better approach would be to make the constructor function internal or private, and remove the payable function or replace it with a more secure alternative.",518,97,5.77573299407959
20,access control," Yes, the vulnerability lies in the initWallet function where the creator is set to msg.sender. This allows any address to initialize the wallet and become the creator, bypassing the intended access control.",731,43,2.8667073249816895
21,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue is the same as in the previous contract: the use of `tx.origin` to check the contract caller's address instead of `msg.sender`. This can be exploited by attackers who call the contract's functions through proxies or other intermediaries. In this case, the `BurnMe` function, which calls `selfdestruct`, could be used to drain the contract's funds if an attacker can call it.",464,105,6.199894189834595
22,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the ""BurnMe"" function. This function uses the selfdestruct opcode, which is a legacy opcode that allows a contract to destroy itself and transfer all of its funds to the address that called the selfdestruct function. This can be exploited by an attacker to drain the contract of funds.

In the given code, the selfdestruct function is not restricted to the contract creator, allowing any caller to call it and drain the contract of funds. This is a clear access control issue.",765,119,7.00578498840332
23,access control," YES, the contract is vulnerable. The `sudicideAnyone()` function allows any address to call it and self-destruct the contract, potentially draining its funds. The `BurnMe()` function, while not directly related to the vulnerability, is also a potential security risk as it allows the contract to destroy itself. However, the primary issue is the lack of access control on the `sudicideAnyone()` function.",408,95,5.632402420043945
24,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The `changeOwner` function is marked as `public`, which means anyone can call it. However, the `onlyowner` modifier is only used in the constructor to set the initial owner. This means that once the initial owner is set, anyone can call the `changeOwner` function to change the owner to any address they want. This is a classic access control vulnerability.",519,87,5.196906566619873
25,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue is the same as in the previous contract: the use of `tx.origin` to check the contract caller's address can be bypassed, allowing unauthorized access to the `withdrawAll` function.",496,55,3.4515719413757324
26,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue lies in the use of `delegatecall` without proper checks on the returned data. In the `withdraw` and `fallback` functions of `FibonacciBalance`, the contract calls `delegatecall` without verifying the returned data, allowing any arbitrary code to be executed. In the given `FibonacciLib` contract, there is a `BurnMe` function that can be called through `delegatecall` and self-destruct the contract.",1092,108,6.505082607269287

This can lead to the value of ""count"" becoming negative, which may not be intended and could potentially lead to unintended contract behavior or security vulnerabilities.",450,78,4.723527669906616
86,arithmetic," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to arithmetic overflows and underflows in the same way as the previous code example. The functions `overflowaddtostate`, `overflowmultostate`, `underflowtostate`, `overflowlocalonly`, and `underflowlocalonly` all contain operations that can result in integer overflows or underflows. This can lead to incorrect contract behavior or even security vulnerabilities.",791,93,5.585103750228882
87,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the 'transfer' function. The'require' statement in line 11 checks if the sender's balance is greater than or equal to the value being transferred. However, the balance is subtracted from the sender's account after the'require' statement. If the balance is less than the value being transferred, the'require' statement will still pass, leading to an integer underflow and potentially allowing the sender to transfer more tokens than they actually have.",634,109,6.480153322219849
88,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue is the same as in the previous code snippet: the use of unsigned integers and the arithmetic operation 'count += input' can lead to integer overflows, which can result in security vulnerabilities or incorrect contract behavior.",360,59,3.6467323303222656
89,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue is similar to the previous one. The line ""sellerBalance += value;"" in the add function can result in an arithmetic overflow, which can lead to security vulnerabilities or incorrect contract behavior.",384,52,3.258582353591919
90,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue is similar to the previous one. In the function `transfer`, the line `balanceOf[_to] += _value;` can lead to integer overflows if the value of `balanceOf[_to]` is not checked before the addition operation. This can result in incorrect contract state and potential security vulnerabilities.",451,76,4.587878704071045
91,bad randomness," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the use of `blockhash` in the `settle` function. The `blockhash` function returns the hash of the block that mined the given block number, which is not the current block hash. This means that the contract will not transfer the ether to the correct address if the miner who mines the block is not the same miner who mined the previous block. This can be exploited by miners to steal ether from the contract.",804,103,6.171612024307251
92,bad randomness," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the use of block.number and msg.sender as sources of randomness in the chooseWinner() function. These values can be predicted and manipulated by miners, making the randomness selection unreliable and potentially allowing for attacks on the contract.",2907,63,4.732320785522461
93,bad randomness," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the use of the `rand()` function to determine the index for paying out unpaid entries. The `rand()` function uses the previous block's hash value and the contract's FACTOR constant to generate a random number, but this method is not truly random and can be manipulated by miners. This vulnerability can allow an attacker to manipulate the order in which entries are paid out, potentially leading to security and efficiency issues.",3158,104,7.439324140548706

95,bad randomness," YES, The vulnerability is similar to the previous one. The answer is generated based on the previous block's hash and the current block timestamp, which can be predicted and manipulated by miners. This can allow attackers to guess the correct answer and drain the contract of funds.",628,60,3.7641665935516357
96,bad randomness," Yes, the smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is similar to the previous code, as the `salt` variable is set to the block timestamp, which is publicly available and predictable. The rest of the code for generating random numbers is also present, making the contract vulnerable to manipulation.",701,63,3.9629769325256348
97,reentrancy," YES, the contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The vulnerability lies in the line where `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` is executed within the Collect function.

98,reentrancy," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable to a Reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the same line as before: `require(msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)());`

This line allows the contract to call an external contract and transfer ether to it before the current transaction is completed, allowing an attacker to reenter the contract and drain it of funds. In the case of the `BurnMe` function, an attacker could call this function right before the `withdrawFunds` transaction, causing the contract to transfer ether to the attacker instead of burning it.",753,131,7.676551342010498
99,reentrancy," YES, the contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The vulnerability lies in the line where `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` is executed inside the Collect function. This line allows the contract to call an external contract's function and transfer ether to it, but it does not check if the external function call completes successfully before continuing with the contract's execution. This means that if the external contract's function call fails or throws an error, the contract will continue executing and transfer ether to the attacker, who can then reenter the contract and drain the funds.",1290,128,7.6494529247283936
100,reentrancy," YES, the contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The vulnerability is similar to the one in the previous code snippet. In the `withdraw` function, the contract calls an external contract (`msg.sender.call.value(_amount)()`) before updating the contract state (`balances[msg.sender] -= _amount`). This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the `withdraw` function and drain the contract of funds before the contract state is updated.",645,103,6.133469343185425

103,reentrancy," YES, the contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks due to the use of the `msg.sender.call.value()` function in the `Collect` function. This function allows the contract to call an external contract and transfer ether to it, but it does not wait for the external call to complete before continuing execution. This means that if the external contract calls back into the `Collect` function before it has finished executing, the contract's state can be changed in the middle of the execution, leading to vulnerabilities such as loss of funds.",1424,116,6.971952438354492
104,reentrancy," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable to a Reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the function `getFirstWithdrawalBonus` where the contract calls `withdrawReward` after updating the state.

137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray()` function. The contract allows any address to add their address to the `listAddresses` array up to a length of 1500. Once the array reaches this length, the contract creates a new empty array, effectively clearing the previous array. This can be exploited by an attacker to repeatedly call the `ifillArray()` function and add their address to the array, denying service to other addresses by filling up the array and preventing them from adding their addresses.
