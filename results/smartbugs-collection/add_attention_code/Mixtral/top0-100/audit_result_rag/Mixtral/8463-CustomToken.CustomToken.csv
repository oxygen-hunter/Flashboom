11,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue lies in the MultiOwnable contract's newOwner function. It does not properly check if the caller is the root address or the current owner. This allows any address to call the newOwner function and become the owner, bypassing the access control.",1028,63,4.140615701675415
12,access control," Yes, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the fact that the `missing` function in the `Missing` contract sets the `owner` address to the `msg.sender` without any checks or restrictions. This means that any address can call the `missing` function and become the owner of the contract. In the given code, this vulnerability is exploited in the `CustomToken` contract where the `totalSupply` is assigned to an arbitrary address during contract creation.",709,105,6.233416318893433

14,access control," Yes, the Wallet contract is vulnerable to access control issues. In the withdraw function, the contract does not check if the sender has sufficient funds before transferring the funds. This allows any address to call the withdraw function and transfer funds from the contract, as long as they have enough ether to pay for the gas fees. The creator address is only checked in the migrateTo function, which is not related to the withdraw function.",905,89,5.405524015426636
15,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the ""CustomToken"" contract constructor where the initial balance is set for a specific address without proper input validation or access control checks.

16,access control," Yes, the given code is vulnerable.

This can allow anyone to take control of the entire token supply.",813,52,3.3577475547790527
17,access control," Yes, the Proxy contract is vulnerable. The issue is with the use of `delegatecall` in the `forward` function. By using `delegatecall`, the Proxy contract is transferring control to the callee contract and allowing it to modify the state of the Proxy contract without proper checks. In the given example, the CustomToken contract is creating a large initial supply and assigning it to an address, which could potentially be controlled by an attacker. This vulnerability can be exploited to perform unauthorized actions or steal funds from the contract.",665,115,6.814095973968506
18,access control," Yes, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

20,access control," Yes, the Wallet contract is vulnerable due to the lack of access control in the initWallet() function.

21,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the use of `tx.origin` to check the contract owner in the `sendTo` function of `MyContract`. This can be bypassed by calling the function from within the contract itself, allowing unauthorized transfers.

22,access control," Yes, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the constructor of the CustomToken contract where the total supply of tokens is hardcoded and assigned to a specific address.

Additionally, the transfer event is emitted before the balance is updated, which can lead to incorrect event data.",959,78,4.233499050140381
23,access control," Yes, the SimpleSuicide contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is that the function `sudicideAnyone()` allows any address to call it and destroy the contract, including the contract's creator's address. This is a problem because it allows any address to take control of the contract and potentially steal funds or manipulate its state. In the given code, there is no access control mechanism in place to prevent unauthorized calls to the `sudicideAnyone()` function.",602,102,6.063913583755493

This can allow an attacker to take control of the initial balance.",713,57,3.711106300354004
25,access control," Yes, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the hardcoded address in the constructor of the CustomToken contract, which sets the initial balance. This hardcoded address can be easily exploited by an attacker to gain control of the contract's funds.",690,61,3.3297746181488037
26,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue lies in the use of `delegatecall` without proper checks on the returned data. In the `withdraw` and `fallback` functions of the `FibonacciBalance` contract, the contract calls the `FibonacciLib` contract using `delegatecall` without checking the returned data. This can allow an attacker to call arbitrary functions or modify the state of the `FibonacciLib` contract, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities or loss of funds.",1286,110,6.655395269393921
27,unchecked low level calls," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the unchecked use of the 'call.value()' function.

31,unchecked low level calls," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue is similar to the one in the previous example. In this case, the `transfer` function in the `airPort` contract calls the `transferFrom` function of an external contract (`caddress`) multiple times without checking the return value.

34,unchecked low level calls," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue lies in the use of the `call()` function in the `transfer()` function of the `AirDropContract` contract. The `call()` function does not revert the transaction if an error occurs, and the contract continues executing the rest of the code. In this case, if any of the `contract_address.call()` calls fail, the transaction will continue and the state of the contract will be changed, potentially leading to unintended consequences.",972,108,5.798150300979614

This can lead to incorrect contract state and potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the contract.",556,95,5.656156778335571
81,arithmetic," The given smart contract code is not directly vulnerable based on the provided code snippet.

It's essential to consider the contract's context and intended use case when evaluating its security.",861,80,4.90642237663269
82,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `buy` function in the `TokenSaleChallenge` contract. The `require` statement in line 23 checks if the `msg.value` (the amount of ether sent with the transaction) is equal to `numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN`. However, this check does not take into account the possibility of an integer overflow. If a user sends more ether than the maximum representable value of a `uint256`, the check will pass even though the transaction contains more ether than intended. This can be exploited to buy more tokens than intended, draining the contract of funds.

Additionally, the `sell` function also has a similar vulnerability in line 33, where it checks if `balanceOf[msg.sender] >= numTokens` without checking for integer overflows. This can allow a user to sell more tokens than they actually have, draining the contract of tokens and ether.

Therefore, the smart contract is vulnerable to integer overflows, which can be exploited to buy or sell more tokens and ether than intended.",991,250,13.735068559646606

The second contract ""CustomToken"" is not directly vulnerable based on the provided code.

However, it is important to note that the BaseToken contract itself is not audited in this answer, and it may contain vulnerabilities.",567,108,6.375015735626221
85,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is similar to the one in the previous example. In the `run` function of the `IntegerOverflowMultiTxOneFuncFeasible` contract, the `count` variable is being decremented by `input`, which can lead to an arithmetic overflow if `input` is large enough. This can result in the `count` variable becoming negative, which is not intended and can lead to unintended behavior or vulnerabilities.

In the `CustomToken` contract, the vulnerability is not directly present, but the `run` function of the `IntegerOverflowMultiTxOneFuncFeasible` contract is being called multiple times in the constructor, potentially allowing for an arithmetic overflow to occur. This could lead to unintended behavior or vulnerabilities in the `CustomToken` contract.",644,179,10.314547300338745
