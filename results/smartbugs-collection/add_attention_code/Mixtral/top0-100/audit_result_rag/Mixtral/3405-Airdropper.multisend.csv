11,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue lies in the `MultiOwnable` contract's `newOwner` function. It allows any address to set a new owner for another address, as long as the address being set is not the zero address. This can be exploited by an attacker to take control of other accounts. In the `TestContract`, the `withdrawAll` function is only protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, which relies on the `owners` mapping in the `MultiOwnable` contract. If an attacker can manipulate the `owners` mapping, they can bypass the `onlyOwner` modifier and steal funds from the contract.",996,144,8.510538816452026
12,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is in the `Airdropper` contract's `multisend` function. The `onlyOwner` modifier is not being used in the function declaration, allowing any address to call the function if they have enough ERC20 tokens to pay for the gas fees. This can lead to unintended transfers of funds from the contract.",677,85,5.15864109992981
13,access control," YES, The vulnerability lies in the 'DynamicPyramid' function where the 'creator' variable is set to'msg.sender'. This function is not marked as 'onlyowner' and can be called by anyone, allowing them to set the contract owner. This can lead to unauthorized access and control of the contract.",3260,70,5.524839639663696
14,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the Wallet contract's withdraw function, where the require statement checks if the amount to be withdrawn is greater than or equal to the current balance of the sender. However, the amount is not checked again after the transfer function is called, which means that if the transfer function fails (for example, due to insufficient funds), the balance will be decreased even though the withdrawal was not completed. This can lead to security vulnerabilities and incorrect contract behavior. In the given code, the Airdropper contract inherits from the Ownable contract, but it doesn't seem to be directly related to the vulnerability in the Wallet contract.",873,146,8.575058937072754
15,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is in the `IamMissing` constructor where the `owner` is set to `msg.sender`. This means that anyone can call the constructor and become the owner of the contract. In the given code, there is no check to ensure that only the intended address can call the constructor. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as an attacker taking control of the contract and draining its funds.

In the second part of the code, the `Airdropper` contract inherits from the `Ownable` contract, which includes the `onlyOwner` modifier. However, the `multisend` function is marked as `onlyOwner`, but it does not check the `msg.sender` against the `owner` before executing the `transfer` function. This means that anyone who has control of the `Airdropper` contract can call the `multisend` function and transfer ERC20 tokens to any address they choose.

Therefore, both the `IamMissing` and `multisend` functions have access control vulnerabilities.",691,238,13.478205919265747
16,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract. The `onlyOwner` modifier is used to restrict the function to the contract owner, but the function itself does not check the return value of the `transfer` function calls. If any of the `transfer` calls fail, the `multisend` function will continue executing the remaining transfers, potentially allowing an attacker to drain the contract of funds.",781,105,6.280261278152466
17,access control," Yes, the Airdropper contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is in the multisend function where the ERC20.transfer function is called without checking its return value. If the transfer fails, the contract will continue executing the rest of the loop, potentially causing unintended consequences or even draining the contract's funds. To mitigate this, the contract should check the return value of the transfer function and revert the transaction if it fails.",633,97,5.798979997634888
18,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the 'Airdropper' contract's'multisend' function. The function iterates through the 'dests' array and calls the 'transfer' function of the 'ERC20' contract for each destination address. However, there is no check to ensure that the 'i' index does not exceed the length of the 'dests' array. If the length of 'dests' is less than the number of iterations, this will result in an array out-of-bounds error and potentially allow an attacker to call the 'transfer' function with an arbitrary address and value.",896,139,8.190241813659668
19,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is in the `Airdropper` contract's `multisend` function. The `onlyOwner` modifier is not being applied to the `multisend` function, allowing any address to call it if they have the `Airdropper` contract instance and the necessary arguments. This can lead to unauthorized transfers of tokens.",680,85,5.1587605476379395
20,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the Wallet contract's initWallet() function where the creator is set to msg.sender. This allows any address to initialize the wallet and become the creator, bypassing the intended access control. In the given code, the creator should be set during deployment or through a separate initialization function with access control checks. In the provided Airdropper contract, the vulnerability is mitigated by using the onlyOwner modifier.",893,102,6.138019561767578
21,access control," YES, The contract is vulnerable to access control issues. In the `Airdropper` contract, the `multisend` function is marked with the `onlyOwner` modifier, but the `require(tx.origin == owner)` statement in the `MyContract` constructor is still present. This means that the `owner` address is set to the deployer's address during deployment, but the `require` statement checks that the transaction origin is the `owner` address, not the deployer's address. This allows anyone who has the `MyContract` instance's address to call the `sendTo` function and bypass the access control check. In the `Airdropper` contract, the `onlyOwner` modifier correctly checks that the message sender is the contract's `owner`, but the `MyContract` constructor's `require` statement should be removed or modified to check the correct address.",626,196,11.278886318206787
22,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the Wallet contract's migrateTo function, which does not properly check the sender's address against the creator address. This allows any address to call the migrateTo function and transfer the contract's balance to another address if they have the contract's creator address. This is a classic access control issue. In the given code, the Airdropper contract inherits from the Ownable contract, which includes the onlyOwner modifier that properly checks the sender's address against the contract's owner address. If the Wallet contract were to inherit from or use the Ownable contract's onlyOwner modifier, the migrateTo function would not be vulnerable.",927,153,8.178164958953857
23,access control," Yes, the SimpleSuicide contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is that the `sudicideAnyone()` function does not have any access control checks, allowing any address to call it and cause the contract to self-destruct and transfer all its funds to the caller. In the given code, the `SimpleSuicide` contract is not used directly, but if it were, it would be vulnerable to this issue.",570,88,5.303424119949341
24,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The `changeOwner` function in the `Unprotected` contract does not have the `onlyowner` modifier applied to it, allowing any address to call it and change the contract owner. In the `Airdropper` contract, the `multisend` function calls the `transfer` function of an external contract (`_tokenAddr`) without checking if the caller is the contract owner. This means that anyone who can call the `multisend` function can transfer tokens on behalf of the contract owner.",681,115,6.839727401733398
25,access control," YES, The contract `Airdropper` is vulnerable to access control issues. The `multisend` function should only be callable by the contract owner, but it is marked with the `onlyOwner` modifier instead of being declared as a `function` inside the contract and marked with the `public` keyword. This means that the function is not accessible to external callers, but it can still be called internally by other functions in the contract. An attacker could exploit this by calling the `multisend` function internally and bypassing the access control check.

Additionally, the contract `Phishable` is also vulnerable to access control issues, as the `withdrawAll` function can be called by anyone as a fallback function, but it should only be callable by the contract owner. This can be fixed by marking the fallback function as `internal` or by adding an access control check at the beginning of the function.",658,204,10.809607982635498
26,access control," YES, The vulnerability lies in the use of `delegatecall` without proper checks on the returned data.

Therefore, there is no way for a malicious user to preempt the contract's state change with a higher fee.

Additionally, the updated code includes the `Ownable` and `ERC20` contracts, which add additional security features, such as the `onlyOwner` modifier and the use of the `transfer()` function from an external ERC20 contract, respectively.

131,time manipulation," YES, The vulnerability lies in the use of block.timestamp to generate randomness in the EtherLotto contract. This can be manipulated by miners, allowing them to influence the outcome of the contract.",933,46,3.071399211883545
132,short addresses," The given smart contract code is not directly vulnerable to the short address attack mentioned in the previous question. However, it does use external contracts (ERC20) and functions (transfer) from those contracts, which could potentially be vulnerable to other types of attacks. It is always important to thoroughly audit any external contracts or libraries used in a smart contract.",943,72,4.507972240447998
133,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `emptyCreditors()` function in the `DosGas` contract. The function checks if the length of `creditorAddresses` is greater than 1500, and if so, it resets the array to an empty one and sets the `win` variable to true. This means that an attacker can repeatedly call the `emptyCreditors()` function to reset the array and set the `win` variable, effectively denying service to other users by preventing them from adding their addresses to the contract. In the given code, there is no check to prevent an attacker from calling this function multiple times. In the `Airdropper` contract, the `multisend()` function is not related to the vulnerability in the `DosGas` contract.",902,180,10.466079711914062
134,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract. The function iterates through an array of destinations and sends ERC20 tokens to each one using the `transfer` function. However, there is no check on the return value of the `transfer` function, which means if a transaction fails (for example, if the destination address is invalid), the loop will continue iterating, causing the contract to continue attempting to send transactions to the failed address, potentially causing a DoS attack on the ERC20 contract or the Ethereum network.",1033,144,8.487766027450562
135,denial of service," YES, The vulnerability lies in lines 46 and 48 where the contract resets the 'creditorAddresses' and 'creditorAmounts' arrays to empty after each transaction. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the 'lendGovernmentMoney' function and drain the contract of funds by repeatedly creating new entries in these arrays without actually lending any money. This is a form of reentrancy attack.",2421,93,6.323586940765381
136,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract. The function calls the `transfer` function of an external contract (`ERC20`) multiple times in a loop without checking the return value of each call. If any of the `transfer` calls fail, the loop will continue, and all subsequent calls will also fail, resulting in a denial of service. In this case, the `refundAll` function in the `Refunder` contract is similar to the `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract, and the same vulnerability exists.",917,140,8.226644515991211
137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `Airdropper` contract's `multisend` function. The function iterates through the `dests` array and calls the `transfer` function of the `ERC20` contract for each destination address. However, there is no check on the return value of the `transfer` function. If the transfer fails for any reason, the function will continue iterating and may not properly handle the failure. This can lead to a denial of service attack, where an attacker can repeatedly call the `transfer` function with invalid addresses or insufficient funds, causing the contract to run out of gas and fail to complete the airdrop.",749,150,8.558237552642822
138,denial of service," Based on the given code, the smart contract ""DosAuction"" is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the line ""require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid))"" in the ""bid()"" function of the ""DosAuction"" contract. This line allows the attacker to perform a denial of service attack by draining the ""currentFrontrunner"" account of all its funds. The attacker can repeatedly call the ""bid()"" function with a higher bid, causing the ""currentFrontrunner"" account to send all its funds to the contract. This can result in the ""currentFrontrunner"" account being drained of all its funds and taken offline, effectively denying the service to other users.",735,164,9.548510551452637
