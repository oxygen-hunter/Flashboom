11,access control," Yes, the vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function in the `MultiOwnable` contract. The function allows any address to set a new owner for the contract as long as it is not the zero address. This can be exploited by an attacker to gain control of the contract. In the `TestContract` contract, the `withdrawAll` function can be used to drain the contract of funds once an attacker has gained ownership.",842,94,5.951589345932007
12,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is similar to the previous one, but in this case, the `missing` function is public, which means anyone can call it and set the contract owner to their address. This can bypass the access control implemented by the `onlyowner` modifier in the `withdraw` function.",523,71,4.560056447982788
13,access control," YES, The contract is vulnerable due to the lack of access control in the 'DynamicPyramid' function. Any address can call this function and set the 'creator' variable, potentially gaining control over the contract.",3106,47,3.969423770904541
14,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `migrateTo` function, where only the `creator` address is checked to ensure that only they can call the function. However, the `msg.sender` address is used to perform the actual transfer of funds. An attacker could call the `migrateTo` function with their own address as the `to` parameter, and then call the `withdraw` function to drain the contract's funds before the transfer in the `migrateTo` function occurs. This bypasses the intended access control.",719,126,7.844166278839111
15,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the constructor function `IamMissing()` which sets the `owner` address to the `msg.sender` address. This means that anyone can call the constructor function and become the owner of the contract. This bypasses the intended access control mechanism established by the `onlyowner` modifier in the `withdraw()` function.",537,83,5.186314821243286
16,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the lack of access control for the'set' function. Any address can call this function and modify the state of the contract, including adding new keys and values to the map. This can lead to unintended consequences or data manipulation. In the previous example, the 'withdraw' function had access control checks, but the'set' function does not.",627,92,5.827279329299927
17,access control," YES, the vulnerability is similar to the previous one. The `require(callee.delegatecall(_data));` statement in the `forward` function can allow an attacker to call untrusted contracts and potentially exploit them. This can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as the transfer of funds or the manipulation of contract state.",479,73,4.65974760055542
18,access control," Yes, the vulnerability is still present in the updated code. The issue is with the require statement in the PopBonusCode function:

require(0 <= bonusCodes.length);

Since array lengths are unsigned, this condition will always evaluate to true, allowing the function to be called even when there are no bonus codes in the array. This can lead to unintended consequences or even contract failure.",742,86,5.502515077590942
19,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is similar to the previous one, but in this case, the constructor function is public, which means anyone can call it and become the owner of the contract. This can lead to unintended consequences or malicious actions. In the previous example, the constructor was marked as 'internal', which means it could only be called from within the contract itself, preventing attackers from exploiting it.",526,91,5.7254157066345215
20,access control," Yes, the vulnerability is still present in the updated code. The `initWallet` function sets the `creator` address to `msg.sender`, which means that any address can initialize the wallet and become the creator. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as allowing an attacker to take control of the contract.",739,69,4.514878273010254
21,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue is the same as in the previous contract: the use of `tx.origin` to check the contract owner can be bypassed. An attacker can create a proxy contract or use a re-entrancy attack to call the `sendTo` function while impersonating the contract owner.",472,71,4.487730979919434
22,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the lack of proper access control in the `migrateTo` function. The `require` statement only checks that the msg.sender is equal to the creator, but it does not check if the msg.sender has the permission to call the migrateTo function. This could allow any address to call the migrateTo function and transfer the contract's balance to another address if the creator is not careful.",773,93,5.340306758880615
23,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is similar to the previous one, but this time the contract includes an event emission function (emitEvent) which can be used to call the selfdestruct function without being the contract owner. An attacker can call this function and cause the contract to self-destruct, transferring all its funds to the attacker's address.",416,80,5.059850215911865
24,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The `changeOwner` function is marked as `public`, which means anyone can call it. However, the function modifier `onlyowner` is intended to restrict the function to the contract owner. Since the function is public, the `onlyowner` modifier is not necessary and can create a false sense of security. An attacker can call the `changeOwner` function to change the contract owner to their own address.",527,95,5.953374147415161
25,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is the same as before, the use of `tx.origin` to check the contract caller's address. This can be bypassed through various methods, such as reentrancy attacks or contract delegation. In this case, an attacker could call the `withdrawAll` function from a contract they control, bypassing the access control check.",504,86,5.2438085079193115
26,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue lies in the use of `delegatecall` without proper checks on the returned data. In the `withdraw` and `fallback` functions, the contract calls `delegatecall` without verifying the returned data, allowing potential attackers to execute arbitrary code. This can lead to various vulnerabilities, including reentrancy attacks and unauthorized contract state changes.",1100,84,5.546099424362183

28,unchecked low level calls," YES, The vulnerability lies in the use of the send() function without checking its return value. In the tokens\_buy() function, the owner's ether balance is transferred using the send() function without checking its return value.

134,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the ""insertNnumbers"" function, specifically in the for loop where the contract keeps appending new elements to the array without checking if the array has enough space. An attacker can exploit this by sending multiple transactions with large numbers of elements to be inserted, causing the contract to run out of gas and fail to process legitimate transactions. Additionally, the ""clearDOS"" function can be used to clear the state of the contract, but it also requires a large gas limit to execute, making it easier for an attacker to deny service to the contract by consuming its gas limit.",879,141,8.809689998626709
135,denial of service," YES, the vulnerability lies in lines 46 and 48 where the contract resets the 'creditorAddresses' and 'creditorAmounts' arrays to empty after each transaction. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the 'lendGovernmentMoney' function and drain the contract of funds by repeatedly creating new entries in the arrays without actually lending any money. This is a denial of service attack as the contract is effectively taken offline by the attacker.",2267,104,6.953596591949463
