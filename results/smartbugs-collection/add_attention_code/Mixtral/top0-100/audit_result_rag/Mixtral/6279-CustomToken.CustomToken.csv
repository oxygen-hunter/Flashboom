1. The constructor function in CustomToken should include the 'payable' keyword to allow users to send ether to the contract during deployment.
2. The initial balance assignment in CustomToken should be done using the '.' notation instead of the '[]' notation to avoid potential integer overflows.
3. The event name in the Transfer event should be defined using the 'keywords' notation instead of the'string' notation to ensure compatibility with future Solidity versions.

Here's the corrected code:

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract BaseToken {
...
}

contract CustomToken is BaseToken {
constructor() payable {
totalSupply = 2100000000000000000000000000;
name = 'YourTokenBlockChain';
symbol = 'YTB';
decimals = 18;
balanceOf[msg.sender] = totalSupply;
Transfer(msg.sender, address(0), totalSupply);
}

function CustomToken() public payable {} // empty constructor for compatibility with older Solidity versions
}

The code consists of two contracts: `BaseToken` and `CustomToken`. The `BaseToken` contract is a simple ERC20 token contract, and the `CustomToken` contract is derived from the `BaseToken` contract and sets some initial values.

Based on the given code, the `CustomToken` contract is not vulnerable to arithmetic overflows or underflows. The only arithmetic operation in the code is the assignment of the `totalSupply` variable in the constructor, but this operation does not involve any additions or subtractions that could result in overflows or underflows.

90,arithmetic," The given smart contract code is not directly vulnerable to arithmetic overflows or underflows based on the provided code snippet. However, there are other potential vulnerabilities and best practices that should be considered, such as proper initialization of contract state variables and input validation.

The `CustomToken` contract initializes the `totalSupply` variable to a very large number, but it is assigned to the `balanceOf` mapping for the contract creator's address in the constructor. This could potentially lead to issues if the contract creator's address is not intended to hold that much of the token supply. Additionally, the `transfer` function in the `IntegerOverflowAdd` contract does not check for sufficient balance before transferring tokens, which could lead to potential reentrancy attacks or other issues.

It's important to keep in mind that a thorough smart contract audit involves a comprehensive review of the entire contract, including all functions, interactions between contracts, and potential edge cases.
