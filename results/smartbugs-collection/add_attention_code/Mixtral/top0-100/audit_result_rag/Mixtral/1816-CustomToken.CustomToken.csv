The code consists of two contracts: `BaseToken` and `CustomToken`. The `BaseToken` contract is a simple ERC20 token contract, and the `CustomToken` contract is derived from `BaseToken` and sets some initial values.

Based on the given code, the `CustomToken` contract is not vulnerable to arithmetic overflows or underflows. The only arithmetic operation in the code is the assignment of `totalSupply` to `balanceOf[msg.sender]`, but this operation is guaranteed to succeed since `totalSupply` is explicitly set to a large constant value and `balanceOf[msg.sender]` is initialized to zero.
