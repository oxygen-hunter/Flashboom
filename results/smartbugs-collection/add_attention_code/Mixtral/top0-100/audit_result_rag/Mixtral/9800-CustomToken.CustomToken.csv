77,arithmetic," The given smart contract code is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the previous code snippet. However, I can evaluate the given code for potential vulnerabilities.

The code defines a contract `CustomToken` that inherits from `BaseToken`. The `CustomToken` constructor initializes the `totalSupply` and sets the balance of a specific address to the total supply. It also emits a `Transfer` event.

Based on the given code, there are no obvious vulnerabilities. However, there are some potential issues that should be noted:

1. The `totalSupply` is set to a very large number (1 quintillion). This may not be intended and could potentially cause issues with gas costs or contract size.
2. The balance of a specific address (0x7F3224B57CBdD3fB2848896F1c31c8aFe91A9aBc) is set to the total supply. This could potentially be a security risk if the address is not intended to have that much control over the contract.
3. The `Transfer` event is emitted after the balance is set, but it is not clear if this event is necessary or if it could potentially be exploited.

This could allow an attacker to buy more tokens than intended by exploiting the integer overflow.

Additionally, the `sell` function does not check if the sender has enough tokens to sell before transferring them, which could lead to a denial of service attack or loss of funds for the contract owner.

The `CustomToken` contract does not seem to have any vulnerabilities on its own, but it is important to note that it is not related to the vulnerability in the `TokenSaleChallenge` contract.",991,209,12.721490144729614
