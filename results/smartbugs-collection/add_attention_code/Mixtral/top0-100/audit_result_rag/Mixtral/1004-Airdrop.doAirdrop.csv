11,access control," Yes, the vulnerability lies in the `TestContract` contract's `withdrawAll()` function. It calls the `transfer()` function of the `msg.sender` address with the entire contract balance, which can be exploited if an attacker gains control of the contract. In the given code, there is no check on the `msg.sender` address before the transfer, making it vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. Additionally, the `TestContract` contract inherits from the `MultiOwnable` contract, but the `withdrawAll()` function does not have the `onlyOwner` modifier applied to it, allowing any address to call it if they have control of the contract.",951,147,9.073834657669067
12,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is in the Airdrop contract's doAirdrop function. The function iterates through the dests array and calls the transferFrom function of the ERC20 contract for each destination address. However, it does not check the return value of the transferFrom function, which can cause the function to continue iterating even if the transfer fails for a particular destination address. This can lead to the contract continuing to transfer funds to an incorrect address or failing to transfer funds to the intended address, resulting in a loss of funds.",632,120,7.540901184082031
13,access control," YES, The contract is vulnerable due to the lack of access control in the 'DynamicPyramid' function.

This means that any address can be passed as a destination and any amount can be transferred, potentially draining the contract of funds.",828,89,6.155430793762207
15,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is in the `Airdrop` contract's `doAirdrop` function. The function iterates through the `dests` array and calls the `transferFrom` function of the `ERC20` contract for each destination address. However, it does not check the return value of the `transferFrom` function call. If the transfer fails for any reason, the function will continue iterating and may not properly handle the failure. This can lead to security vulnerabilities or incorrect contract behavior. In the given example, the `transferFrom` function is not shown, but it is likely that it throws an exception on failure. By not checking the return value, the `doAirdrop` function will not properly handle this exception and may continue iterating, potentially causing unintended consequences.",646,177,10.77098298072815
16,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is in the `Airdrop` contract's `doAirdrop` function. The function does not check the return value of the `transferFrom` function calls, which can lead to the contract continuing to transfer tokens even if a previous transfer fails. This can result in the contract transferring tokens to the wrong address or not transferring enough tokens to the intended address.

17,access control," Yes, the smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is in the Proxy contract's forward function, which uses delegatecall without proper validation of the callee address. This can allow an attacker to call into an unintended contract, potentially leading to unintended contract state changes or the transfer of funds. In the given example, the Airdrop contract is calling into the Proxy contract, which then uses delegatecall to call into the ERC20 contract. However, there is no check on the callee address being the expected ERC20 contract address, so an attacker could potentially call into a different contract instead.",588,134,8.292755126953125
18,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the 'Airdrop' contract's 'doAirdrop' function.

19,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is in the Airdrop contract's doAirdrop function. The function uses msg.sender as the sender for every transferFrom call, which can allow an attacker to perform unauthorized transfers if they can call the doAirdrop function.

20,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the initWallet() function where the creator is set to msg.sender. This means that any address can call the initWallet() function and become the creator of the contract. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as an attacker taking control of the contract and draining its funds. In the given example, the migrateTo() function requires the creator to be the msg.sender, but since any address can become the creator, this requirement is bypassed.",848,111,6.984326362609863
21,access control," YES, The contract is vulnerable to access control issues. The `require(tx.origin == owner)` statement in the `sendTo` function of `MyContract` contract allows only the contract owner to call the function. However, the `doAirdrop` function in the `Airdrop` contract calls the `sendTo` function of `MyContract` without checking if the caller is the contract owner. This allows any caller to call the `doAirdrop` function and transfer funds from the `MyContract` contract.",581,113,7.0285937786102295
22,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `doAirdrop` function in the `Airdrop` contract.

26,access control," YES, The vulnerability lies in the use of `delegatecall` without proper input validation. The `delegatecall` function calls an external contract's function with the given data, but it does not perform any input validation. This can allow an attacker to pass malicious data to the contract, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks or unintended contract state changes. In this specific case, the `withdraw` and `fallback` functions in the `FibonacciBalance` contract both call external functions using `delegatecall` without input validation.",1209,122,7.711972236633301

Additionally, the contract uses the ""send"" function to transfer funds to the winner, but this function can throw exceptions if it fails. If the ""send"" function fails, the contract does not have a mechanism to handle the failure and will continue executing, potentially leading to unintended consequences.

The use of the ""delete"" keyword to delete the ""players"" array and reset the ""tot"" variable is also questionable, as it can lead to unintended consequences if the contract is not properly initialized or if an error occurs during execution.

Additionally, the use of ""uint256[] values"" can lead to integer overflows or underflows if not handled properly, which can result in security vulnerabilities or incorrect contract behavior.",784,107,6.720319032669067
82,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the buy function where the require statement checks that msg.value equals numTokens * PRICE\_PER\_TOKEN. This check can lead to an integer overflow, as msg.value is a uint256 and numTokens and PRICE\_PER\_TOKEN can be arbitrarily large. If an attacker sends a value larger than the maximum representable value of a uint256, the require statement will not be met, but the contract will still execute the rest of the function, allowing the attacker to buy more tokens than intended. This can lead to a loss of funds for the contract or the attacker.

Additionally, the sell function also has a similar vulnerability in the require statement that checks that balanceOf[msg.sender] >= numTokens. This can also lead to an integer underflow if the balance is smaller than expected, allowing the attacker to sell more tokens than they actually have, draining the contract of funds.

The Airdrop contract does not seem to have any vulnerabilities related to the given code snippet. However, it is important to note that the contract's functionality as a whole should still be thoroughly audited to ensure its security.",914,259,15.562121629714966

The `sendCoin` function in the `MyToken` contract transfers ether from `msg.sender` to the `to` address without checking if the transaction has been mined on the blockchain yet. This means that an attacker could call `sendCoin` multiple times with the same `to` address before the first transaction is mined, draining the `msg.sender`'s balance of the contract's token.

The `doAirdrop` function in the `Airdrop` contract exacerbates this vulnerability by calling `transferFrom` in a loop without checking if each individual transfer has been mined before making the next call. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call `transferFrom` for the same `to` address, potentially draining the attacker's own balance of the contract's token and then draining the `msg.sender`'s balance as well.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `sendCoin` function in the `MyToken` contract should include a check to see if the transaction has already been mined before transferring ether. This can be done by checking the `block.timestamp` or the `tx.receipt.status`. Similarly, the `doAirdrop` function in the `Airdrop` contract should include checks to ensure that each individual",898,301,18.271528959274292

By setting `creditorAddresses` to an empty array and setting `win` to true, the contract effectively denies service to all previous creditor addresses. This can be exploited to prevent legitimate users from interacting with the contract. Additionally, the `addCreditors()` function allows any address to add up to 350 addresses to the `creditorAddresses` array, which can be used to fill the array and trigger the `emptyCreditors()` function. This can be exploited to deny service to all previous creditor addresses and potentially cause a denial of service attack.

The `Airdrop` contract does not directly interact with the `DosGas` contract, so it is not directly vulnerable. However, if the `Airdrop` contract is used to distribute tokens to addresses in the `DosGas` contract, it could potentially be used to trigger the denial of service attack.",857,218,13.191489696502686

135,denial of service," YES, The vulnerability lies in lines 46 and 48 where the contract resets the 'creditorAddresses' and 'creditorAmounts' arrays to empty after each transaction. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the 'lendGovernmentMoney' function and drain the contract of funds by reusing the same address multiple times. This is a classic denial of service attack.",2376,87,5.986142873764038
136,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue lies in the Refunder contract's refundAll() function, where the contract sends ether to multiple addresses in a single transaction using the require statement. If one of the send transactions fails, it will cause the entire refundAll() function to fail and prevent the remaining refunds from being processed. This can be exploited to deny service to the contract by causing one of the send transactions to fail intentionally.",872,94,5.985713243484497
137,denial of service," Yes, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray()` function of the `DosOneFunc` contract, specifically the for loop that pushes the msg.sender address into the `listAddresses` array multiple times if the array length is less than 1500. An attacker can exploit this by calling the `ifillArray()` function repeatedly, causing the contract to consume a large amount of gas and potentially denying service to other transactions. In the given example, the `Airdrop` contract calls the `ifillArray()` function multiple times, which can be easily exploited to cause a DoS attack.",704,155,9.414684295654297
138,denial of service," YES, The vulnerability lies in the DosAuction contract's bid function, specifically the require statement in line 23: require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid)); This function call can cause the contract to run out of gas if the currentFrontrunner has insufficient funds, resulting in a denial of service. Additionally, there is no check to ensure that the currentFrontrunner is the actual owner of the contract, allowing anyone to call the function and potentially drain the contract of funds. The Airdrop contract does not directly interact with the DosAuction contract and is not vulnerable on its own.",690,140,8.61074447631836
