11,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue is with the `newOwner` function in the `MultiOwnable` contract. It allows any address to set a new owner for any other address, including the original owner. This can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the contract.

20,access control," Yes, the Wallet contract is vulnerable due to the lack of access control in the initWallet function.

21,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the contract MyContract's sendTo function, where the access control is based on the tx.origin being equal to the contract owner. This is insecure because the tx.origin is the address of the account that initiated the transaction, not the contract owner's address. In the given code, the contract owner is set to msg.sender during contract deployment, but this value is not checked in the sendTo function, so any account can call the sendTo function and transfer funds if they have the contract address.

The BaseToken and CustomToken contracts are not directly related to the vulnerability in the MyContract contract. However, they do have their own potential vulnerabilities, such as the lack of proper access control in the CustomToken constructor, which sets the balance of a specific address to the total supply without any checks.

YES

The vulnerability lies in the ""IntegerOverflowSingleTransaction"" contract, specifically in the functions ""overflowaddtostate"", ""overflowmultostate"", ""underflowtostate"", ""overflowlocalonly"", ""overflowmulocalonly"", and ""underflowlocalonly"".

The code consists of two contracts: `BaseToken` and `CustomToken`. The `BaseToken` contract is a simple ERC20 token contract, and the `CustomToken` contract is derived from it.

The `CustomToken` contract initializes the contract with a total supply of 100 billion tokens and assigns all tokens to a single address. The transfer event is also triggered with the initial transfer.

Based on the given code, there is no arithmetic overflow or underflow vulnerability present. The contract does not perform any arithmetic operations that could result in an overflow or underflow.
