21,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the use of `tx.origin` in the `sendTo` function of the `MyContract` contract. This can be bypassed by calling the function from within the contract itself, allowing unauthorized access to the contract's functionality.

23,access control," Yes, the SimpleSuicide contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is that the function `sudicideAnyone()` allows any address to call it and destroy the contract, including the contract's creator's address.

In the given code, there is no access control mechanism in place to prevent unauthorized calls to the `sudicideAnyone()` function.",598,102,6.057317733764648
24,access control," Yes, the given code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the fact that the constructor function of the CustomToken contract initializes the owner address with a hardcoded value, which is not secure.

The `require` statement in line 23 checks if the `msg.value` (the amount of ether sent with the transaction) is equal to `numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN`. However, this check does not take into account the possibility of an integer overflow. If a user sends more ether than the maximum representable value of a `uint256`, the check will pass even though the transaction contains more ether than intended. This can be exploited to buy more tokens than intended, draining the contract of funds.

Additionally, the `sell` function also has a similar vulnerability in line 33, where it checks if `balanceOf[msg.sender] >= numTokens` without checking for integer overflows. This can allow a user to sell more tokens than they actually have, draining the contract of tokens and ether.

Therefore, the smart contract is vulnerable to integer overflows, which can be exploited to buy or sell more tokens and ether than intended.",987,250,14.177398204803467
