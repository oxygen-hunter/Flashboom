However, there is no check on the return value of the `transfer` function. If an attacker sends a transaction to one of the addresses with a value greater than the attacker's balance, the `transfer` function will fail, but the `multisend` function will continue iterating through the array, causing it to get stuck in an infinite loop and consuming all the gas.

137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function in the `BITXMultiTransfer` contract. The `multisend` function calls the `transfer` function of an external contract (`Token`) multiple times without checking its return value. If the `transfer` function call fails for any reason, the `multisend` function will continue executing the remaining calls, potentially causing a denial of service or other unintended consequences. This is a common vulnerability known as ""Reentrancy Attack"".",799,116,8.246229410171509
138,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function in the `BITXMultiTransfer` contract. The `transfer` function in the `Token` contract is called multiple times in a loop without checking its return value. If any of these transfers fail, the loop will continue, potentially causing the contract to continue executing and wasting resources. This can be used as a denial of service attack.",785,93,5.955661058425903
