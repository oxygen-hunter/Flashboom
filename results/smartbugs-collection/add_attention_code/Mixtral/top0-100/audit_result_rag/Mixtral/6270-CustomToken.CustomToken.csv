The code consists of two contracts: `BaseToken` and `CustomToken`. The `BaseToken` contract is a simple ERC20 token contract, and the `CustomToken` contract is derived from `BaseToken` and sets some initial values.

Based on the given code, the contracts do not appear to be vulnerable to arithmetic overflows or underflows. The only arithmetic operation in the code is the assignment of `totalSupply` to `balanceOf[msg.sender]` in the `CustomToken` constructor, but this operation is guaranteed to succeed since `totalSupply` is set to a fixed value and `balanceOf` is a mapping that can only store non-negative values.
