89,arithmetic," The given smart contract code is not the same as the one in the previous question, so I will evaluate it separately.

The code consists of two contracts: `BaseToken` and `CustomToken`. The `BaseToken` contract is a simple ERC20 token contract, and the `CustomToken` contract is derived from `BaseToken` and sets some initial values.

Based on the given code, the `CustomToken` contract is not vulnerable to arithmetic overflows or underflows. The only arithmetic operation in the code is the assignment of `totalSupply` to `balanceOf[msg.sender]`, but this operation is guaranteed to succeed since `totalSupply` is a constant value and `balanceOf` is a mapping that can only store non-negative values.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",626,181,11.022670269012451
90,arithmetic," Yes, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is similar to the one in the previous example.

In the given example, the `withdraw` function calls an external contract's function `msg.sender.call.value(amount)()` and then updates the contract's state by subtracting the amount from the sender's credit.
