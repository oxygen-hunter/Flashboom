11,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue lies in the `newOwner` function in the `MultiOwnable` contract. The function allows any address to set a new owner for the contract as long as the address is not zero. This means that an attacker can call this function and set themselves as the new owner, bypassing the intended access control.

In the given example, the `TestContract` contract inherits from `MultiOwnable` and has a `withdrawAll` function that can be called by the contract owner to transfer all the contract's funds to an attacker. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability in the `MultiOwnable` contract to set themselves as the new owner and call the `withdrawAll` function.

The `Brute` contract in the code is not related to the vulnerability. It is a separate contract that has a function to send ERC20 tokens from one address to another.",917,202,12.33037281036377
12,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is in the `missing()` function where the `owner` is set to `msg.sender`. This means that anyone can call the `missing()` function and become the owner of the contract. This can lead to unauthorized access to the contract's functions and funds.

In the second contract, the `Brute` contract is not directly related to the vulnerability in the `Missing` contract. However, if the `Brute` contract is used to call the `sendToken()` function with malicious intent, it could potentially exploit the vulnerability in the `Missing` contract.",598,137,8.489152193069458
13,access control," YES, The vulnerability lies in the ""DynamicPyramid()"" function, where the creator is set to msg.sender, allowing anyone to call this function and become the contract creator. This bypasses the intended access control.",3181,50,4.185113191604614
14,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the ""withdraw"" function where the contract does not check if the sender has sufficient funds before transferring the funds. An attacker can call the ""withdraw"" function repeatedly with an amount greater than their balance, draining the contract of funds.

Additionally, the ""migrateTo"" function can be exploited as it does not check if the sender has the creator role before transferring the contract's balance. This can allow any address to take control of the contract and drain its funds.

The new contract ""Brute"" does not seem to be related to the vulnerability in the ""Wallet"" contract. It appears to be a separate contract that interacts with an ERC20 token contract.",794,163,10.0317223072052
15,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is in the ""IamMissing"" constructor where the owner is set to msg.sender. This means that anyone can call the constructor and become the owner of the contract. In the given code snippet, there is an additional contract ""Brute"" which can be used to exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the ""IamMissing"" constructor and transferring the contract's funds to an attacker's address.",612,99,6.175121545791626
16,access control," The given code consists of three contracts: Map, ERC20, and Brute. The Map contract is the same as in the previous question, and it is vulnerable due to the access control issue as explained earlier.

The ERC20 contract is a standard token contract, and it is not vulnerable in this code snippet as it is not interacting with the Map contract or any other contract that could potentially have vulnerabilities.

The Brute contract, however, is interacting with the Map contract and the ERC20 contract. The vulnerability in the Brute contract lies in the fact that it does not check the return value of the transferFrom function call in the sendToken function. If the transferFrom function call fails, the Brute contract will continue executing, potentially allowing an attacker to drain the contract of funds.

Therefore, the answer is 'YES', and the vulnerability is due to the lack of checking the return value of the transferFrom function call in the Brute contract's sendToken function.",702,219,13.261486768722534
17,access control," Yes, the smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the use of `delegatecall` in the `forward` function of the `Proxy` contract. This function allows calling an external contract's function directly, bypassing the access control checks of the `Proxy` contract. In the given example, the `Brute` contract can call the `transferFrom` function of an `ERC20` contract directly, bypassing any access control checks that the `ERC20` contract might have. This can lead to unauthorized transfers of tokens.",554,122,7.532407999038696
18,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the Wallet contract's PopBonusCode function where the length of the bonusCodes array is checked using an unsigned integer. Since array lengths are unsigned, this condition will always evaluate to true, allowing an attacker to repeatedly call the PopBonusCode function and drain the contract of bonus codes without actually removing them from the array. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as allowing an attacker to access or manipulate the contract's state.

In the given code snippet, the Brute contract is not directly related to the vulnerability in the Wallet contract, but it does demonstrate an example of how an attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability by repeatedly calling the PopBonusCode function to drain the bonusCodes array.",817,169,10.393879652023315
19,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is in the ""Constructor"" function of the ""Missing"" contract where the owner is set to the msg.sender. In the given code snippet, there is an additional contract ""Brute"" which can be used to call the ""Constructor"" function multiple times and set a new owner each time. This can lead to unintended access control issues. In the given example, the ""Brute"" contract is not shown to be malicious, but an attacker could easily create a similar contract and exploit this vulnerability.",601,120,7.471298456192017
20,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the initWallet() function where the creator is set to msg.sender. This means that any user can call the initWallet() function and become the creator of the contract, giving them control over the contract's functionality, including the migrateTo() function which can transfer the contract's balance to any address. This can be exploited to steal funds from the contract. In the given code snippet, there is an additional contract 'Brute' which can be used to exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the initWallet() function to become the creator and then using the migrateTo() function to transfer the funds to an attacker's address.",814,149,9.248379945755005
21,access control," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the use of `tx.origin` to check the contract owner. This can be bypassed by calling the `sendTo` function from a contract controlled by an attacker, allowing them to transfer funds from the contract. The `Brute` contract demonstrates this vulnerability by using the `transferFrom` function of an ERC20 token contract to transfer funds from the `MyContract` owner.",547,95,5.9334142208099365
22,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the ""migrateTo"" function, where the contract's balance is transferred to the new address without checking if the new address is the same as the creator's address. This can allow an attacker to take control of the contract by calling the ""migrateTo"" function with their own address.",848,76,4.498457670211792
23,access control," YES, the SimpleSuicide contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is that the selfdestruct function can be called by any address, making it possible for an attacker to call the function and cause the contract to transfer all of its funds to the attacker's address. In the case of the Brute contract, it is calling the SimpleSuicide contract's sudicideAnyone function, making it possible for an attacker to drain the funds of the Brute contract by calling the SimpleSuicide contract's function.",491,110,6.842759609222412
24,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The `changeOwner` function is marked as `public`, which means anyone can call it. However, it does not have any checks on the `_newOwner` address. This means an attacker can call the `changeOwner` function and set the `owner` variable to any address they want, bypassing the `onlyowner` modifier. This can lead to unauthorized access to the contract's functionality and funds.

In the second code snippet, the `Brute` contract is not directly related to the vulnerability in the `Unprotected` contract. However, it does demonstrate a common pattern in smart contracts where one contract calls another contract's function without proper checks. This can lead to unintended consequences or vulnerabilities in the calling contract. In this case, the `sendToken` function in the `Brute` contract calls the `transferFrom` function in the `ERC20` contract without any checks on the `_from` address. This means an attacker can call the `sendToken` function and pass their own address as `_from`, potentially draining funds from the `ERC20` contract.",602,250,15.139056205749512
25,access control," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the use of `tx.origin` to check the contract owner in the `withdrawAll` function. An attacker can call this function from any address, but if they send a transaction with enough gas to call the function, they can cause the contract to transfer all its funds to the attacker's address. In the given code snippet, the `Brute` contract is not relevant to the vulnerability.",579,101,5.7971460819244385
26,access control," YES, The vulnerability lies in the use of `delegatecall` without proper checks on the returned data. This can allow an attacker to call arbitrary functions on the `fibonacciLibrary` contract and potentially steal funds or manipulate the contract's state. In the given example, an attacker could potentially call the `transferFrom` function of an ERC20 contract to steal tokens from another address.",1175,88,5.698141813278198

32,unchecked low level calls," YES, the vulnerability lies in the 'cash' function where the'send' function is called without checking its return value. This can lead to the contract continuing execution even if the'send' call fails, resulting in unintended consequences. In this case, the contract may not properly mark the subpot as cashed, allowing multiple winners for the same subpot. Additionally, in the 'constructor' function, the'send' function is called without checking its return value as well, which can lead to the contract continuing execution even if the send call fails, potentially losing ether.",2862,123,8.355034112930298

The code provided for the ERC20 contract follows best practices for handling approvals and transfers.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",2179,84,5.773882865905762
76,front running," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks. The vulnerability lies in the ""play"" function, which allows users to submit their number and pay 1 ether to participate in the game. Since the contract does not check the gas price of the incoming transaction, a malicious user can submit a higher gas price to preempt the next user's transaction and win the game before the next user even has a chance to participate. This can lead to the malicious user repeatedly winning the game and draining the contract of funds.

Additionally, the contract's ""andTheWinnerIs"" function sends ether to the winner, but it does not check if the sender is the contract owner before sending the ether. This can allow a malicious user to call the ""getProfit"" function and drain the contract of funds if they manage to call it before the contract owner.

The use of the ""Brute"" contract and the ""ERC20"" contract does not affect the vulnerability of the ""OddsAndEvens"" contract.",1010,225,13.365154504776001
77,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is similar to the one in the first contract. In the function `sendToken` of contract `Brute`, the `transferFrom` function of contract `ERC20` is called with no check on the return value. If the transfer fails (i.e., the sender does not have enough tokens), the function will continue executing and may cause an integer overflow or underflow in the following lines. This can lead to security vulnerabilities or incorrect contract behavior.",478,108,6.662123441696167
78,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is similar to the one in the first contract. In this case, the vulnerability is in the `sendToken` function of the `Brute` contract, where `_value` is multiplied with the `count` variable without checking for potential overflows. This can allow an attacker to drain the `_from` account of more tokens than intended.",445,87,5.5008392333984375
79,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability is in the contract ""Overflow_Add"". The function ""add"" in the contract ""Overflow_Add"" does not check for arithmetic overflows when adding the deposit to the balance. This can lead to the balance becoming larger than the maximum representable value for a uint256, resulting in incorrect contract behavior or even a denial of service attack. In the second contract ""Brute"", it is calling the vulnerable contract's function ""add"" indirectly through the ERC20 contract's ""transferFrom"" function. Therefore, the vulnerability also affects the contract ""Brute"".",435,138,8.489979982376099
80,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is similar to the one in the first contract. In this case, the vulnerability is in the ""sendToken"" function of the ""Brute"" contract. The line ""count -= input;"" in the ""run"" function of the ""IntegerOverflowMinimal"" contract can be compared to ""token.transferFrom(_from, _to, _value)"" in the ""sendToken"" function of the ""Brute"" contract.

81,arithmetic," The given smart contract code is not the TimeLock contract provided in the previous question. Instead, it consists of three separate contracts: TimeLock, ERC20, and Brute.

Since the provided code is not the same as the vulnerable TimeLock contract, it is not vulnerable to the arithmetic overflow vulnerability discussed earlier.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",750,82,5.286124229431152
82,arithmetic," YES, the vulnerability lies in the buy function in the TokenSaleChallenge contract. The require statement in line 23 checks if msg.value (the amount of ether sent by the user) is equal to numTokens \* PRICE\_PER\_TOKEN. However, this check does not take into account the possibility of an integer overflow, which can occur if numTokens is large enough. If an integer overflow occurs, the value of numTokens \* PRICE\_PER\_TOKEN will be incorrect, and the require statement will pass even if the user has sent less ether than required. This can lead to the contract accepting less ether than intended, allowing an attacker to buy fewer tokens than they should be able to.

Additionally, the sell function also has a similar vulnerability in the require statement on line 33. The contract checks if the balanceOf[msg.sender] is greater than or equal to numTokens, but it does not check for integer overflows. This can allow an attacker to sell more tokens than they actually have, draining the contract of funds.

Therefore, both the buy and sell functions in the TokenSaleChallenge contract are vulnerable to integer overflows.",880,261,15.735058307647705
83,arithmetic," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to integer overflows. The vulnerability is in the `run` function of the `IntegerOverflowMultiTxMultiFuncFeasible` contract where `count` is subtracted from `input`.

85,arithmetic," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to arithmetic overflows. In the `run` function of the `IntegerOverflowMultiTxOneFuncFeasible` contract, the `count` variable is decremented by the `input` value. If `input` is larger than the current value of `count`, an arithmetic overflow will occur, resulting in incorrect contract behavior or potential security vulnerabilities.

The vulnerability is exacerbated in the `Brute` contract, where the `sendToken` function calls the `transferFrom` function of an ERC20 contract with an arbitrary `_value` input. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to drain funds from the contract.",533,152,9.31975245475769

88,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is similar to the one in the first contract. The line ""count += input"" in the ""run"" function of the ""IntegerOverflowAdd"" contract can lead to arithmetic overflows, which can result in incorrect contract behavior or even security vulnerabilities.

90,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is similar to the one in the previous code snippet. In the `transfer` function of the `IntegerOverflowAdd` contract, the `balanceOf[_to]` variable is updated by adding `_value` to it. If `_value` is larger than the current value of `balanceOf[_to]`, an integer overflow will occur, leading to incorrect contract behavior or potential security vulnerabilities. In this case, the vulnerability is compounded by the fact that the `transfer` function does not check for overflows, and the `transferFrom` function in the `ERC20` contract is used without proper checks as well.",534,146,8.606950759887695
91,bad randomness," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of `blockhash` in the `settle` function of the `PredictTheBlockHashChallenge` contract. The `blockhash` function returns the hash of the most recent block, which is publicly available information. An attacker can easily predict the hash and submit a guess before the contract's block number advances, allowing them to claim the reward even if they have not correctly guessed the block hash.

The `Brute` contract does not directly affect the vulnerability, but it can be used to automate the process of submitting incorrect guesses to the `PredictTheBlockHashChallenge` contract, increasing the chances of an attacker successfully guessing the block hash before the contract does.",887,165,10.175764322280884

An attacker can call this function repeatedly when the length of `creditorAddresses` is greater than 1500. This will reset the `creditorAddresses` array and set `win` to true, effectively denying service to other users by clearing the list of creditor addresses. Additionally, the `addCreditors()` function allows for the addition of up to 350 new addresses at a time, which can be easily exploited to reach the length limit in the `emptyCreditors()` function. The `Brute` contract, while not directly related to the vulnerability, can be used to repeatedly call the `emptyCreditors()` function, exacerbating the issue.",823,171,10.503679275512695
134,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the for loop where the contract checks if `numElements` equals the `array.length`. An attacker can exploit this by sending multiple transactions to insert more elements than the current array size, causing the contract to continuously allocate more memory and increasing the gas cost for each transaction. This can be used to deny service to the contract by making it unfeasible for legitimate users to interact with it due to the high gas cost.

Additionally, the `clearDOS` function can be used by an attacker to clear the state of the contract, including the array, and reset the `numElements` variable, allowing them to start the DoS attack again.

The `Brute` contract, which is used in the given code, is not directly related to the vulnerability in the `DosNumber` contract. However, it can be used by an attacker to send multiple transactions to the `DosNumber` contract, exacerbating the DoS attack.",954,240,14.557974338531494
135,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in lines 46 and 48 where the contract resets the 'creditorAddresses' and 'creditorAmounts' arrays to empty after each transaction. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the 'lendGovernmentMoney' function and drain the contract of funds by repeatedly creating new entries in these arrays. This is a form of denial of service attack, as the contract becomes unavailable for legitimate transactions. The attacker can also manipulate the contract's state by repeatedly calling the function and creating new entries in the arrays. Additionally, the contract does not check the balance of the contract before sending ether to the corruptElite address, allowing the contract to run out of ether and become unavailable for legitimate transactions.",2342,168,10.70064091682434
136,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The issue lies in the `refundAll()` function in the `Refunder` contract. The `require()` statement in line 24 of the `Refunder` contract will cause the entire function to fail if any single `send()` call fails. This means that if one refund address is unable to receive the funds, then no refunds will be sent to any address.

In the given code, the `Brute` contract is introduced, which can be used to repeatedly call the `sendToken()` function to drain the funds of the `Refunder` contract. Since the `refundAll()` function in the `Refunder` contract will fail if any single `send()` call fails, an attacker can repeatedly call the `sendToken()` function in the `Brute` contract to prevent any refunds from being sent to the intended recipients. This is a denial of service attack.",838,202,12.306679964065552
137,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray()` function of the `DosOneFunc` contract. The function allows any address to add their address to the `listAddresses` array up to a length of 1500. An attacker can exploit this by repeatedly calling the `ifillArray()` function to fill the array with their address, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by consuming all available gas or storage.

In the given example, the `Brute` contract is not directly related to the vulnerability, but it can be used to repeatedly call the `sendToken()` function to exploit the vulnerability in the `DosOneFunc` contract.",670,159,9.814357280731201
138,denial of service," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `bid()` function of the `DosAuction` contract, specifically the line `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));`. This line calls the `send()` function of the `currentFrontrunner` address and sends it the `currentBid` amount. If this transaction fails (for example, if `currentFrontrunner` has insufficient funds), the `require()` statement will not revert the transaction, allowing the attacker to continue bidding with a higher value. This can be exploited to cause a denial of service by repeatedly calling the `bid()` function with increasing bids until the contract runs out of gas or the attacker's funds are depleted.

The `Brute` contract does not directly affect the vulnerability, but it can be used to send ERC20 tokens to the `DosAuction` contract and potentially exacerbate the denial of service attack.",656,222,13.439927101135254
