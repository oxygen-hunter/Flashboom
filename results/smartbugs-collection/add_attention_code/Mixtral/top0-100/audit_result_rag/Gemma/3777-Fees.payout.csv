The contract has a vulnerability related to the `payout` function. It uses a fixed percentage of the contract's balance to transfer funds to the developers. This can be exploited by an attacker to drain the contract of funds.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call the `Collect` function repeatedly, potentially draining the contract's funds. 
* **Unclear Execution Flow:** The code lacks clarity on how the `if` statement interacts with the external contract call.
