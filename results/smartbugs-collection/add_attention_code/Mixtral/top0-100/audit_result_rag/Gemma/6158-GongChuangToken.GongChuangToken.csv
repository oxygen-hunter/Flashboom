The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled External Calls:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function allows external calls to the contract's `Withdraw` function.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time attempting to drain funds from the contract. 
* **No Safeguard:** The function doesn't include any safeguards to prevent this.

The `airDrop` function in the `ModifierEntrancy` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `airDrop` function calls `ModifierEntrancy(msg.sender).airDrop()` which means it can be called repeatedly by an attacker.
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:**  The `airDrop` function doesn't handle external contract calls properly.
