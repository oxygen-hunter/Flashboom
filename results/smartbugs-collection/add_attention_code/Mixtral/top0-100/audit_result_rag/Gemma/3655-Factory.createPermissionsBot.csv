* **Unrestricted External Calls:** The `Collect` function allows external calls to be made within the contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `Collect` multiple times within a short period, potentially draining the contract's funds. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The code doesn't have any safeguards to prevent this type of attack.

122,reentrancy,"YES
 
The code uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which allows an attacker to call the contract again before the initial execution is complete. This is a classic reentrancy attack.

123,reentrancy,"YES
 
The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  The `if` statement allows an attacker to call the `Collect` function repeatedly before the initial execution is complete.

The `CashOut` function allows an attacker to call `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a reentrancy vulnerability.

The contract relies heavily on `block.timestamp` for its functionality. This makes it susceptible to manipulation by miners, as they can potentially alter the reported timestamp.

The contract relies on `block.timestamp` for the `random` variable. This is vulnerable because miners can manipulate the timestamp, potentially leading to unfair outcomes.

The contract creates a permissions bot that can be used to control the ENS_Permissions contract. This could be exploited to deny service to the contract.

137,denial of service,"YES

The contract creates a new `ENS_Permissions` contract for every call to the `createPermissionsBot` function. This creates a potential denial of service attack as the contract can be overloaded with requests.
