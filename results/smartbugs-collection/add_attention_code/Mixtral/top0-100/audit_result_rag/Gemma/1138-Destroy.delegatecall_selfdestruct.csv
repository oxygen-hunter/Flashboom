* **Reentrancy:**  The `delegatecall_selfdestruct` function allows an attacker to call the `selfdestruct` function of another contract while the contract is still executing. 
* **Exploitation:**  An attacker can call `delegatecall_selfdestruct` with a malicious payload that triggers the `selfdestruct` function of the contract. 
* **Consequences:** The `selfdestruct` function destroys the contract and transfers all its remaining funds to the attacker.
