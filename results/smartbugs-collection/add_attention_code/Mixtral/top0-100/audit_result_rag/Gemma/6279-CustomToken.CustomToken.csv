The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls an external contract (`_addr.call.value(_wei)`) which is a potential point of vulnerability.
* **Reentrancy:**  The attacker can call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time before the previous one has finished executing. This creates a loop where the contract's state is constantly changing, leading to a reentrancy attack.

The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `CashOut` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 
* **Unclear Execution:** The code doesn't specify how the `call.value(_am)` function is executed. This leaves room for an attacker to potentially manipulate the execution flow.

The `withdrawBalance` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `withdrawBalance` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)()` which is an external contract call.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `withdrawBalance` multiple times in rapid succession, potentially draining the contract's funds. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `withdrawBalance` function doesn't explicitly handle the possibility of multiple calls.
