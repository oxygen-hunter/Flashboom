The `send` function in Solidity is a low-level function that can be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
 
The vulnerability lies in line 110:             msg.sender.send(valuePaid);
 
The vulnerability lies in line 118:             msg.sender.send(excessPaid);
 
The vulnerability lies in line 132:             currentMonarch.etherAddress.send(compensation);
 
The vulnerability lies in line 174:         wizardAddress.send(amount);
 
These lines call the `send` function, which can be exploited by an attacker to drain funds from the contract. 
 
Here's why:
 
* **Reentrancy:** An attacker can call `claimThrone` multiple times in a short period, potentially draining funds from the contract. 
* **Unprotected `send`:** The `send` function doesn't have any checks to prevent reentrancy or other vulnerabilities. 
* **Lack of Error Handling:** The `send` function doesn't handle errors gracefully, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploits.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is an external contract call.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This call allows an attacker to potentially call the `Collect` function again before the initial execution is complete, leading to a reentrancy attack.
