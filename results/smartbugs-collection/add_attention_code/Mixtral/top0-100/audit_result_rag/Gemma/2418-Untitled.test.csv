The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `Collect` function doesn't handle the potential for the external contract to call itself again before the initial execution is complete.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This call allows an attacker to potentially call the `Collect` function repeatedly, draining the contract's funds.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled External Calls:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls an external address (`_addr`) using `_addr.call.value(_wei)`. This means the contract doesn't know the outcome of the external call.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time before the previous one has finished. This creates a loop where the contract keeps trying to execute the external call, potentially draining funds.

The `airDrop` function in the `ModifierEntrancy` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `airDrop` function calls `Bank(msg.sender).supportsToken()` which is an external contract call.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `supportsToken` function in the `Bank` contract could be called multiple times before the `airDrop` function completes, leading to a reentrancy attack.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `if` statement allows the `Collect` function to call an external contract (`msg.sender.call.value(_am)`) before the `Collect` function's execution is complete. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:** This external contract call could be a reentrancy attack vector. The attacker could call the `Collect` function multiple times, draining the contract's funds.
