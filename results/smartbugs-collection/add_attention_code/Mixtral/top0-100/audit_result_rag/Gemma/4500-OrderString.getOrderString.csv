The code has several vulnerabilities:

* **Unchecked Return Values:** The `claimThrone` function doesn't check the return value of `msg.sender.send(valuePaid)`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploits.
* **Low Level Function Calls:** The `send` function is a low-level function that doesn't propagate errors. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploits. 
* **Unprotected Access:** The `transferOwnership` function allows anyone to change the contract's owner. This is a security vulnerability. 
* **Unclear Logic:** The `_orderString` variable is not well-defined. It's unclear what it does or how it's used. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:** The `claimThrone` function could be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

The contract uses the `withdrawBalance` function which allows the caller to withdraw funds. This function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because it allows the caller to call the function again before the initial execution is complete.

129,time manipulation,"YES
 
The contract relies heavily on `block.timestamp` for its functionality, making it susceptible to manipulation by miners. This is a classic vulnerability in smart contracts that use the block timestamp for critical functions.

",648,4,0.22869253158569336
131,time manipulation,"YES
 
The contract uses `block.timestamp` in the `sha3` function to generate a random number. This is a potential vulnerability because the miners can manipulate the timestamp, leading to an unfair outcome.

The contract's `getOrderString` function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.  The function is designed to return a string, but it does not have any checks to prevent reentrancy.

135,denial of service,"YES
 
The code has a vulnerability related to the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays.  These arrays are initialized with `new address[](0)` and `new uint[](0)`, respectively. This means that the arrays are empty, and therefore, there is no way to track the creditor addresses and amounts. 

This can be exploited by an attacker to drain the contract of funds.

136,denial of service,"YES

The contract uses a string for its internal order string. This string is not a standard data type and is not used for any other purpose. This could be exploited to cause denial of service.
