The `claimThrone` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
 
Here's why:
 
* **Reentrancy:** The `claimThrone` function allows the attacker to call it repeatedly, potentially draining funds.
* **Potential for Exploitation:** The `msg.sender.send(valuePaid)` line is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
 
The attacker can call `claimThrone` multiple times, each time sending a different amount of Ether. 
 
* **Example:** An attacker could call `claimThrone` with a small amount of Ether, then call it again with a larger amount, draining the contract's funds. 
 
**Mitigation:** 
* **Reentrancy Guard:** Implement a reentrancy guard to prevent the attacker from calling `claimThrone` multiple times. 
* **Transaction Locking:**  Consider using a transaction locking mechanism to prevent the attacker from executing multiple transactions.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unrestricted External Calls:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function allows external calls to the contract's `Withdraw` function.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time attempting to drain funds from the contract. 
* **No Safeguards:** The function doesn't include any safeguards to prevent this type of attack.

The contract uses the `supportsToken` function in the `Bank` contract to determine if the token is supported. This function is called in the `airDrop` function of the `ModifierEntrancy` contract. This means that the `airDrop` function can be called multiple times, potentially leading to a reentrancy attack.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is an external contract call. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This external call could be re-entered by the attacker, leading to a chain of calls that drain the contract's funds.
