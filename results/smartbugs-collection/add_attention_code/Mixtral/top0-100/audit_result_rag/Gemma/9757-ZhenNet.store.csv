The code has several vulnerabilities:

* **Unchecked Return Values:** The `claimThrone` function doesn't check the return value of `msg.sender.send(valuePaid)`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploits.
* **Low Level Function Calls:** The `msg.sender.send(valuePaid)` and `msg.sender.send(excessPaid)` lines are vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
* **Unprotected Access Control:** The `transferOwnership` function is not properly protected. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:** The `claimThrone` function could be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
* **Lack of Robust Error Handling:** The code lacks robust error handling, which could lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

The code has a vulnerability related to Denial of Service (DoS).  The line `creditorAddresses = new address[](0);` and `creditorAmounts = new uint[](0);`  are vulnerable to DoS attacks.  These lines are used to store the creditor addresses and amounts.  If an attacker can send a large number of transactions to the contract, they can potentially exhaust the contract's memory and cause it to crash.

The contract's `ifillArray` function is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. It pushes the sender's address into the `listAddresses` array repeatedly, potentially exhausting the contract's memory and causing it to crash.
