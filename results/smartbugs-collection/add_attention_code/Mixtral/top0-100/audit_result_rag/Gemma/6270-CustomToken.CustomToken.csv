The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is an external contract call.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This external call could be re-entered by the attacker, leading to a chain of calls that drain the contract's funds.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls an external contract (`_addr`) with a value (`_wei`).
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The external contract call could be reentrant, meaning it could be called again before the initial call is complete. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** This could lead to an attacker repeatedly calling the `WithdrawToHolder` function, draining funds from the contract.

The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `CashOut` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 
* **Unclear Execution:** The code doesn't specify how the `call.value(_am)` function is executed. This leaves room for an attacker to potentially manipulate the execution flow.
