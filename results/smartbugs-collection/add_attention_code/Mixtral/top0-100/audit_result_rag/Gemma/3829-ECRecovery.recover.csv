The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Reentrancy:**  This call to an external contract can be re-entered by the attacker, leading to a potential reentrancy attack.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:
