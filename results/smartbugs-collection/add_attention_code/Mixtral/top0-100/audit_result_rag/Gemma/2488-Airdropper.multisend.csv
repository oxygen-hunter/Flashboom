The `multisend` function in the `Airdropper` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:**  The `multisend` function calls the `ERC20` contract's `transfer` function for each destination address.  This means that an attacker could potentially call the `multisend` function multiple times, each time before the previous one has finished. 
* **Potential for Loss:**  This could lead to a situation where the attacker repeatedly calls the `transfer` function, draining the contract's funds.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This call to an external contract could be re-entered by the attacker, leading to a re-entrancy attack. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `Collect` function does not have any checks to prevent the attacker from repeatedly calling the function.
