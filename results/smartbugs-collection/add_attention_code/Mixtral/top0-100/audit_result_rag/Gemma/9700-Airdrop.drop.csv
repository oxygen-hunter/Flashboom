The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **Unrestricted External Calls:** The `Collect` function allows external calls to be made within the contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `Collect` multiple times within a short period, potentially draining the contract's funds. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The code doesn't have any safeguards to prevent this type of attack.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `if` statement allows the `Collect` function to call an external contract (`msg.sender.call.value(_am)`) before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:** This external contract call could be a reentrancy attack vector, as the `Collect` function might be called again before the previous call is finished.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time before the previous one has finished executing. 
* **Unpredictable Execution:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function doesn't handle the potential for multiple calls, leading to an unpredictable execution flow.

The `airDrop` function in the `ModifierEntrancy` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `airDrop` function calls `Bank(msg.sender).supportsToken()` which is an external contract call.
* **Reentrancy:**  The `supportsToken` function in the `Bank` contract is designed to be called by the `airDrop` function.  This means that the `airDrop` function can be called again before the initial execution is complete.

The `Airdrop` contract uses the `transfer` function of the ERC20 token contract. This function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **Unprotected `transfer`:** The `transfer` function in the ERC20 contract is not inherently secure against reentrancy.
