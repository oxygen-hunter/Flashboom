The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `Collect` function doesn't explicitly check for reentrancy. If an attacker calls `Collect` multiple times in rapid succession, they could potentially drain the contract's funds.

The contract uses the `multisend` function which allows multiple transfers to be made at once. This is a common vulnerability in smart contracts, as it can be exploited by an attacker to drain funds from the contract. 

Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:** The `multisend` function could be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. An attacker could call the `multisend` function multiple times, each time attempting to transfer funds to a different address. 
* **Lack of Input Validation:** The `multisend` function does not validate the input values. An attacker could send a large amount of tokens to the contract, potentially causing a denial-of-service attack. 
* **Lack of Gas Limit:** The `multisend` function does not have a gas limit. This could lead to the contract running out of gas and failing.
