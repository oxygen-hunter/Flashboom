The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 
* **Unclear Execution Flow:** The code doesn't clearly define how the `Collect` function interacts with the external contract. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `Collect` multiple times, potentially draining funds from the contract.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled External Calls:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function allows external calls to the contract's `Withdraw` function.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time attempting to drain funds from the contract. 
* **No Safeguards:** The function doesn't include any safeguards to prevent this type of attack.

The `Rainmaker` contract has a potential vulnerability related to the `letItRain` function.  Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:** The `letItRain` function allows an attacker to potentially re-enter the function repeatedly, leading to a reentrancy attack. 
* **Uncontrolled Transfers:** The function transfers funds to multiple addresses without proper checks. This can be exploited by an attacker to drain funds from the contract.

The contract uses `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays to store information about creditors and their amounts.  These arrays are initialized with a length of 0, which means they are empty.  This can be exploited to perform denial of service attacks. 

Here's why:

* **Denial of Service:**  The contract can be made to appear as if it's processing transactions, but it's actually not. This can lead to a denial of service attack, where the contract becomes unresponsive to legitimate requests.
* **Resource Exhaustion:**  The contract can be made to consume a large amount of gas, which can lead to resource exhaustion. This can be exploited to make the contract unresponsive to legitimate requests. 
* **Memory Exhaustion:**  The contract can be made to consume a large amount of memory, which can lead to memory exhaustion. This can be exploited to make the contract unresponsive to legitimate requests.
