The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unrestricted External Calls:** The `Collect` function allows external calls to be made within the contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `Collect` multiple times within a short period, potentially draining the contract's funds. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The code lacks any safeguards to prevent multiple calls to `Collect` from a single address.
