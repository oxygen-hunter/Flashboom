The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This call to an external contract could be re-entered by the attacker, leading to a chain of calls that drain the contract's funds.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls an external contract (`_addr.call.value(_wei)`) which is a potential point of vulnerability.
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:**  The `WithdrawToHolder` function doesn't handle the external contract call's return value. This means an attacker could potentially call the function multiple times, draining the contract's funds.

The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `CashOut` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 
* **Unclear Execution:** The code doesn't specify how the `call.value(_am)` function is executed. This leaves room for an attacker to potentially execute malicious code within the contract.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `Collect` function doesn't explicitly check for reentrancy. If an attacker calls `Collect` multiple times in rapid succession, they could potentially drain the contract's funds.
