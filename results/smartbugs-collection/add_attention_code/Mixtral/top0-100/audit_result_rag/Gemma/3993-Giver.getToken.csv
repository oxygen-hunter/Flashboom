The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `Collect` function could be called repeatedly by an attacker, leading to a reentrancy attack.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `if` statement checks if the `msg.sender` has a balance and if the current time is after the `acc.unlockTime`. If so, it calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 
* **Unclear Execution:** The code doesn't specify how the `_am` value is handled. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:** The `if` statement allows for an attacker to call the `Collect` function repeatedly, draining the contract's funds.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled External Calls:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function allows external calls to the `_addr` contract. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time before the previous one resolves. This could lead to a reentrancy attack, draining funds from the contract.

The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:
