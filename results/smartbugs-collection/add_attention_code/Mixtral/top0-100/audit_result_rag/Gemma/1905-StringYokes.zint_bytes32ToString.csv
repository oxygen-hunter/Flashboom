The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled External Calls:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls `_addr.call.value(_wei)()` which allows an attacker to potentially call the contract again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The attacker could call the `WithdrawToHolder` function multiple times, draining the contract's funds.

The contract uses the `supportsToken` function to check if the caller has the `Nu Token` contract. This function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:** The `supportsToken` function calls the `airDrop` function of the `ModifierEntrancy` contract.  
* **Potential for Reentrancy:** The `airDrop` function could be called again before the first call is complete, leading to a reentrancy attack. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `airDrop` function could be called multiple times, leading to an attacker draining the contract's funds.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which means it's calling an external contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `if` statement checks for a condition, but the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` call could be re-entered by the attacker. 
* **Unpredictable Execution:** The attacker could potentially call the `Collect` function multiple times, leading to a reentrancy attack.
