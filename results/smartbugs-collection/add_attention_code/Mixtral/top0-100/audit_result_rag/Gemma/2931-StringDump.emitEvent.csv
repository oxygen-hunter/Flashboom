 The code has several vulnerabilities related to the `send` function.  Here's why:

* **`msg.sender.send(valuePaid)`:** This line sends the `valuePaid` to the `msg.sender` address.  The `send` function in Solidity is not a safe way to transfer funds. It does not handle errors or rejections. If the `msg.sender` address is not the intended recipient, the funds could be lost. 
* **`msg.sender.send(excessPaid)`:**  Similar to the previous vulnerability, this line sends the `excessPaid` to the `msg.sender` address. 
* **`currentMonarch.etherAddress.send(compensation)`:** This line sends the `compensation` to the `currentMonarch.etherAddress`.  This is a potential vulnerability as it could be exploited to drain funds from the contract.

The contract relies heavily on `block.timestamp` for its functionality. This makes it susceptible to manipulation by miners, as they can adjust the reported timestamp.

The contract relies on `block.timestamp` for the `random` variable. This is vulnerable because the miners can manipulate the timestamp, potentially leading to an unfair outcome.

The contract's `emptyCreditors` function has a potential denial of service vulnerability.  It sets the `creditorAddresses` array to an empty array if the length exceeds 1500. This can be exploited to make the contract unresponsive to further requests.

The contract's `insertNnumbers` function can be exploited to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.  Here's why:

* **Infinite Loop:** The `insertNnumbers` function uses a loop that continues indefinitely.  
* **Resource Exhaustion:**  The loop could potentially consume all available memory on the blockchain, leading to a denial of service.

The code has a denial of service vulnerability.  The lines `creditorAddresses = new address[](0);` and `creditorAmounts = new uint[](0);`  are vulnerable to denial of service attacks.

The contract's `ifillArray` function pushes the sender's address into the `listAddresses` array repeatedly, potentially leading to a denial of service attack. This is because the function can be called repeatedly, and the `listAddresses` array can be filled with a large number of addresses, causing the contract to become unresponsive.
