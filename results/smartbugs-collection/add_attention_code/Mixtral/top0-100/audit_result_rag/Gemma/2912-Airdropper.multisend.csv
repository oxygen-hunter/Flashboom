The contract's `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unprotected External Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which allows an attacker to potentially call the contract again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:** This creates a reentrancy vulnerability because the `Collect` function can be called repeatedly by an attacker, draining the contract's funds.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unprotected External Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a direct call to the sender's contract. This means that the contract can be called repeatedly, potentially draining funds. 
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:**  The `Collect` function doesn't have any checks to prevent reentrancy.
