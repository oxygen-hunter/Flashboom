The code has several vulnerabilities related to the `send` function.  Here's why:

* **Potential for Transaction Failure:** The `send` function in Solidity can fail.  This means the contract might not be able to send the specified amount to the recipient.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `if` statement calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is an external contract call.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This call could be re-entered by the attacker, leading to a chain of calls that drain the contract's funds.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `if` statement checks for a condition before executing the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` function. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call the `Collect` function multiple times within a short period, potentially draining the contract's funds. 
* **Unclear Execution Flow:** The code lacks clarity on how the `Collect` function interacts with the external contract.
