The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which means it's calling an external contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `if` statement checks for a condition, but the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` call could be re-entered by the external contract, leading to a reentrancy attack.
