The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Unrestricted External Calls:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function allows external calls to the contract's `Withdraw` function.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time before the previous one resolves. This creates a loop where the contract's state is constantly changing, potentially leading to a reentrancy attack.
