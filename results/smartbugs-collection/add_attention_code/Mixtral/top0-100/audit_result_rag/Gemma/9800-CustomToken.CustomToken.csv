The `claimThrone` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

2. The `claimThrone` function is called, and the attacker sends a larger amount of Ether.
3. The `msg.sender.send(valuePaid)` line is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

* **Reentrancy Guard:** Implement a reentrancy guard to prevent the attacker from calling the function repeatedly. 
* **Transaction Ordering:** Ensure that the contract's execution is ordered to prevent the attacker from exploiting the vulnerability.
