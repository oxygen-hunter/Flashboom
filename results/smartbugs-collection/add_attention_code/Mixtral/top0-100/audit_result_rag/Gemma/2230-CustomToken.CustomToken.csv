The code has several vulnerabilities:

* **Unchecked Return Values:** The `claimThrone` function doesn't check the return value of `msg.sender.send(valuePaid)`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.
* **Low Level Function Calls:** The `claimThrone` function uses `msg.sender.send(valuePaid)` and `msg.sender.send(excessPaid)`. These functions are low-level and can be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.
* **Unprotected Access Control:** The `transferOwnership` function allows anyone to change the contract's owner. This is a security risk.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is an external contract call. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This external call could be re-entered by the attacker, leading to a chain of calls that drain the contract's funds.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled External Calls:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function allows external calls to the `_addr` contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time before the previous one resolves. This creates a loop where the contract keeps executing the external call, draining funds.

The contract uses the `airDrop` function, which is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:** The `airDrop` function allows an attacker to call it repeatedly, potentially draining the contract's funds. 
* **Unprotected `airDrop`:** The `airDrop` function doesn't have any checks to prevent reentrancy. 
* **External Contract Call:** The `airDrop` function calls `ModifierEntrancy(msg.sender).airDrop()`, which means an attacker can call the function multiple times.
