The `Command` function in the `Freebie` contract allows arbitrary code execution by calling the target address with the provided data and value. This is a classic example of a reentrancy vulnerability.

The `send` function in Solidity is a low-level function that can be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
 
The vulnerability lies in line 110:             msg.sender.send(valuePaid);
 
The vulnerability lies in line 118:             msg.sender.send(excessPaid);
 
The vulnerability lies in line 132:             currentMonarch.etherAddress.send(compensation);

These lines call the `send` function, which can be exploited by an attacker to drain funds from the contract. 
 
Here's why:
 
* **Reentrancy:** An attacker can call `send` repeatedly within a loop, potentially draining funds from the contract. 
* **Lack of Error Handling:** The `send` function doesn't handle errors gracefully, so it doesn't propagate errors to the caller. 
* **Unpredictable Behavior:** The behavior of `send` can be unpredictable, making it difficult to detect and prevent attacks.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls an external contract (`_addr.call.value(_wei)`) which is a potential point of vulnerability.
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:**  The `WithdrawToHolder` function doesn't handle the external contract call's return value. This means an attacker could potentially call the function multiple times, draining the contract's funds.

The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `CashOut` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 
* **Unclear Execution:** The code doesn't specify how the `call.value(_am)` function is executed.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `Collect` function doesn't explicitly check for reentrancy. If an attacker calls `Collect` multiple times in rapid succession, they could potentially drain the contract's funds.
