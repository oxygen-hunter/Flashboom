The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is an external contract call. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  This external call could be re-entered by the attacker, leading to a chain of calls that drain the contract's funds. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The code lacks any safeguards to prevent reentrancy.

The `withdrawFunds` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Call:** The `require(msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)())` line allows the contract to make an external call to the `msg.sender` address.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `withdrawFunds` multiple times in rapid succession, potentially draining the contract's funds.

The `disperseToken` function in the `Disperse` contract allows for the transfer of tokens from the `msg.sender` to multiple addresses (`_to`) with varying amounts (`_value`). This function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **Reentrancy:** The `disperseToken` function calls the `transferFrom` function of the ERC20 token contract. This function is susceptible to reentrancy attacks because it allows the `msg.sender` to call the `transferFrom` function again before the previous call is complete. 
* **Potential for Multiple Calls:** The `disperseToken` function allows the `msg.sender` to call the `transferFrom` function multiple times, potentially leading to a reentrancy attack.
