The contract uses the `withdrawReward` function, which allows an attacker to call `getFirstWithdrawalBonus` again before the `withdrawReward` function completes. This creates a reentrancy vulnerability.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 
* **Unclear Execution:** The code doesn't specify how the `_am` value is handled. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `Collect` multiple times, potentially draining the contract's funds.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **Unrestricted External Calls:** The `Collect` function allows external calls to be made within the contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `Collect` multiple times within a short period, potentially draining the contract's funds.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled External Calls:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function allows external calls to the `_addr` contract.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time before the previous one resolves. This creates a loop where the contract keeps executing the external call, draining funds. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The code lacks any checks to prevent the `WithdrawToHolder` function from being called repeatedly.

The `airDrop` function in the `ModifierEntrancy` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `airDrop` function calls `Bank(msg.sender).supportsToken()` which is an external contract call.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The `supportsToken` function in the `Bank` contract could be called multiple times within the `airDrop` function, leading to a reentrancy attack.
