The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `if` statement allows the `Collect` function to call an external contract (`msg.sender.call.value(_am)`) before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:** This external call could be a reentrancy attack, as the contract's state might change in the middle of its execution.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled External Calls:** The `Collect` function allows external calls to be made within the contract. 
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `Collect` multiple times within a short period, potentially draining funds before the contract can complete the intended transfer. 
* **Lack of Safeguards:** The code lacks any safeguards to prevent this type of attack.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time before the previous one has finished executing. 
* **Unpredictable Execution:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function doesn't handle the potential for multiple calls, leading to an unpredictable execution flow.

The `airDrop` function in the `ModifierEntrancy` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `airDrop` function calls `ModifierEntrancy(msg.sender).airDrop()` which means it can be called repeatedly by an attacker.
* **No Locking:** The `airDrop` function does not have any locking mechanisms to prevent multiple calls.
