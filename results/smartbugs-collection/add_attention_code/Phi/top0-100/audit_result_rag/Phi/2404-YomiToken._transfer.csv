The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the `require` statement in the `withdraw` function on line 20. The issue is that the `require` statement checks if the amount to be withdrawn is greater than or equal to the balance of the sender, which is not a valid check for a withdrawal operation. The correct check should be whether the amount to be withdrawn is less than or equal to the balance of the sender.

Additionally, the `SafeMath` library is used in the `YomiToken` contract, which is a good practice to prevent overflow and underflow issues. However, the vulnerability in the `Wallet` contract remains unaddressed.",1252,156,6.5925469398498535

16,access control," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `set` function, specifically in the line `map[key] = value;`. This function allows anyone to add or modify elements in the `map` array, which could lead to unauthorized changes in the contract's state.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add an access control mechanism to restrict who can call the `set` function. One way to do this is by using a modifier that checks if the caller is the owner of the contract. Here's an example of how you can modify the contract to add access control:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Map {
    address public owner;
    uint256[] map;

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, ""Caller is not the owner"");
        _;
    }

    function set(uint256 key, uint256 value) public onlyOwner {
        if (map.length <= key) {
            map.length = key + 1;
        }

        map[key] = value;
    }

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in the `Proxy` contract. The `forward` function in the `Proxy` contract allows any contract to execute its code within the context of the `Proxy` contract. This can lead to potential access control issues if the `callee` address is not properly validated or if it's an untrusted contract. An attacker could exploit this by creating a malicious contract that, when called through the `Proxy`, could potentially access or manipulate the state of the `Proxy` contract in unintended ways.

Additionally, the `SafeMath` library is used in the `YomiToken` contract, which is a good practice to prevent overflow and underflow issues. However, the vulnerability in the `Proxy` contract remains unaddressed.",1004,180,7.50195837020874

Additionally, the `SafeMath` library is used in the `YomiToken` contract, which is a good practice to prevent overflow and underflow issues. However, the `YomiToken` contract itself is not vulnerable to access control issues as described in the initial code snippet.",1286,151,6.417096138000488
19,access control," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` to validate callers, which can lead to access control bypasses. However, in this specific code snippet, there is no direct usage of `tx.origin`. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `onlyowner` modifier is used to restrict access to the `withdraw` function, but the constructor function is public and does not have the `onlyowner` modifier, allowing any caller to set the `owner` address. This could potentially be exploited if an attacker can influence the contract creation process or if the contract is deployed by an untrusted entity.

Additionally, the `YomiToken` contract uses SafeMath library for arithmetic operations, which is a good practice to prevent overflow and underflow issues. However, the `_transfer` function in the `YomiToken` contract has a potential vulnerability in the line:

```solidity
require(balances[_to] + _value > balances[_to]);
```

This line is redundant and can be removed, as the SafeMath library already ensures that the addition operation does not overflow. The presence of this line does not introduce a security vulnerability, but it is unnecessary and can be considered a code quality issue.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `msg.sender.transfer(balances[msg.sender]);` in the `refund` function. This line of code is attempting to transfer the entire balance of the contract to the `msg.sender`, which is the same address that is calling the `refund` function. This is a common access control vulnerability known as reentrancy, where the contract calls an external contract (in this case, the `transfer` function of the `msg.sender` address) that can lead to unexpected behavior or even allow the external contract to call back into the original contract before the initial operation is completed.

In this specific case, if the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract, it could potentially call back into the `refund` function multiple times before the balance is deducted, leading to a significant loss of funds from the contract. This vulnerability was famously exploited in the DAO attack on the Ethereum network.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a pattern that ensures the balance is updated before the transfer is made, such as the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.",1311,257,10.697975397109985

The `call` function is used to send Ether and/or call functions on other contracts. However, if the call fails, it will not revert the transaction and will return `false`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploits.

To fix this vulnerability, you should check the return value of the low-level call and handle the failure case appropriately. For example:

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the same unchecked low-level call issue as the first example. The vulnerability lies in the line where the `target.call.value(msg.value)();` is called.

54,unchecked low level calls," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to unchecked low-level calls. The vulnerability lies in the use of the `call` function in the `transfer` function of the `demo` contract. The `call` function is a low-level function that does not revert on failure, and its return value is not checked. This can lead to fail-open vulnerabilities and other unwanted outcomes.

In the provided code, the `caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v);` line in the `transfer` function is the source of the vulnerability. The `call` function is used to transfer tokens from the `from` address to the `_tos` array of addresses. However, the return value of the `call` function is not checked, which means that if the call fails, the code will continue to execute without reverting the transaction.

To fix this vulnerability, the return value of the `call` function should be checked, and the transaction should be reverted if the call fails. This can be done by using the `require` or `assert` statements to check the return value of the `call` function and revert the transaction if necessary.",1118,258,10.709010124206543

The vulnerability lies in the same line 44: `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);`

This line is using the low-level call function without checking the return value. If the call fails, the transaction will continue to execute, which can lead to unexpected outcomes. This is a potential vulnerability as it can be exploited by attackers to cause fail-opens or other unwanted outcomes.

To fix this vulnerability, the return value of the call function should be checked and appropriate actions should be taken based on the result. For example:

```
if (adr.call.value(msg.value)(data)!= 0) {

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to front running due to the public visibility of pending transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. This allows malicious actors to observe transactions and potentially exploit the order of transactions to their advantage.

In this contract, the `claimReward` function (line 31) transfers the reward to the `msg.sender` before the `setReward` function (line 23) transfers the reward to the `owner`. This means that if a malicious user sees a pending transaction to claim a reward, they can submit a higher-fee transaction to claim the reward before the original transaction is mined.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should ensure that the reward is transferred to the `msg.sender` in the `setReward` function before the `claimReward` function is called. This can be achieved by changing the order of the functions or by adding a check to ensure that the `claimed` variable is set to true before transferring the reward in the `claimReward` function.",1220,238,9.923157691955566

This allows a malicious user to see the state of the contract and submit a transaction with higher gas fees to be mined first, potentially altering the outcome of the game before the original transaction is processed.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should be designed in a way that prevents users from seeing the state of the contract before their transaction is processed, or by using a commit-reveal scheme where users commit their choices without revealing them and only reveal them at a later time when it is too late for others to front run.",1468,193,8.15041971206665

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the `_transfer` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
require(balances[_from].sub(_value) >= teamReserve);
```

and

```solidity
require(balances[_from].sub(_value) >= foundationReserve);
```

In the SafeMath library, the `sub` function is used to prevent integer underflow. However, the `require` statement checks if the result of the subtraction is greater than or equal to the reserves, which is not the correct logic. The correct logic should be to check if the result of the subtraction is less than or equal to the reserves.

Additionally, the `require` statement:

```solidity
require(balances[_to] + _value > balances[_to]);
```

is redundant and can be removed, as the SafeMath library's `add` function already ensures that the result of the addition is greater than or equal to both operands.

To fix the vulnerability, the `require` statements should be updated to:

```solidity
require(balances[_from].sub(_value) < teamReserve);

These lines check if the balance after the transfer is still greater than or equal to the respective reserves. However, the SafeMath library's `sub` function is used, which can still cause an integer underflow if `_value` is greater than `balances[_from]`. This can lead to a negative balance, which is not intended and can be exploited by an attacker.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the SafeMath library's `sub` function for all arithmetic operations, including the checks in the `_transfer` function. This will ensure that the contract is protected against integer overflows and underflows.",894,237,9.823959350585938

will result in an underflow, causing the balance to become a very large number (2^256 - _value). This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploits.

To fix this vulnerability, you can modify the `_transfer` function to check for the exact balance equal to the value being transferred and handle it appropriately. For example, you can add a condition to check if the balance is equal to the value and set the balance to zero in that case:

```solidity
if (balances[_from] == _value) {

This line checks if the sender's balance is greater than or equal to the value being transferred. However, if the sender's balance is at the maximum possible value of `uint256` (2^256 - 1), adding any positive value to it will cause an overflow, resulting in a wrap-around to a smaller number. This can lead to a situation where the sender's balance appears to be sufficient for the transfer, but in reality, it is not.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the SafeMath library's sub function to check the sender's balance before the transfer:

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow, despite the use of the SafeMath library. The vulnerability lies in the `_transfer` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
require(balances[_to] + _value > balances[_to]);
```

This line is intended to prevent integer underflow by ensuring that the balance of the recipient address (`_to`) after the transfer is greater than the balance before the transfer. However, the SafeMath library's `add` function is not used here, and the built-in Solidity `+` operator is used instead.

The Solidity compiler at version `^0.4.10` does not have the SafeMath library's overflow checks built-in, and the `+` operator does not perform these checks. As a result, if the recipient's balance is very close to the maximum value of a `uint256` (2^256 - 1), adding `_value` to it could cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect balance and potentially allowing for funds to be stolen.

To fix this vulnerability, the SafeMath library's `add` function should be used instead of the built-in `+` operator:

The `blockhash` function returns the hash of a block, which is deterministic and predictable.

The given code is vulnerable due to the use of predictable randomness in the `chooseWinner` function. The vulnerability lies in the following lines:

line 110: address seed2 = contestants[uint(msg.sender) % totalTickets].addr;
line 111: uint seed3 = block.difficulty;

The randomness used for choosing the winner is based on the block's coinbase, the sender's address, and the block's difficulty. However, miners can manipulate the coinbase and block difficulty to some extent, which can lead to predictable outcomes. This predictability can be exploited by a malicious user to increase their chances of winning.

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `airDrop` function within the `ModifierEntrancy` contract. The `airDrop` function modifies the state of the contract by adding tokens to the user's balance, and it is publicly accessible. If an attacker can create a fallback function in an external contract that calls back into the `airDrop` function, they can repeatedly call it before the initial transaction is completed, potentially draining the contract's funds.

This can lead to unfair advantages or unexpected behavior in the contract.",1246,86,3.7672131061553955
129,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `resetInvestment` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp + ONE_MINUTE)
```

This condition checks if the current block timestamp is less than the `lastInvestmentTimestamp` plus one minute. An attacker can exploit this by manipulating the block timestamp to be within the allowed time frame, allowing them to call the `resetInvestment` function and reset the jackpot and last investor.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a more reliable source of time, such as block.number or a time oracle service, to determine the elapsed time between investments.",1526,171,7.25070595741272
130,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same lines as the previous code:

The vulnerability lies in line 18: require(now!= pastBlockTime); // only 1 transaction per block

The vulnerability lies in line 20: pastBlockTime = now;

In the contract, the pastBlockTime is set to the current block timestamp (now) and then checked to ensure it is not equal to the previous pastBlockTime. This check is intended to prevent multiple transactions from being executed in the same block. However, miners can manipulate the timestamp of a block, which can lead to the exploitation of this check.

An attacker could potentially manipulate the block timestamp to be slightly less than the pastBlockTime, causing the require condition to fail and allowing multiple transactions to be executed in the same block. This could lead to the unintended distribution of funds or other unintended consequences.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a more robust time-based mechanism, such as using block.number or a time oracle service, to prevent reliance on the block timestamp for critical contract logic.",1098,255,10.545764207839966
131,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same line as the first code snippet, line 43:

var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;

This line uses block.timestamp to generate a random number, which can be manipulated by miners. An attacker with control over the mining process could manipulate the block timestamp to influence the outcome of the random number generation, potentially affecting the distribution of winnings in the EtherLotto contract.",1312,119,5.1277995109558105
132,short addresses," YES

The provided smart contract code is not vulnerable to short address attacks because it uses the `address` type for the `to` parameter in the `sendCoin` function, which is not susceptible to the padding issue that affects the `address payable` type.",1305,61,2.7763657569885254
133,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the function can be called repeatedly to keep the `creditorAddresses` array at a length of 1500 or less, which prevents the `win` state from being set to true. This can be exploited by an attacker to continuously call the `emptyCreditors` function, effectively preventing the `iWin` function from ever returning true.

An attacker can repeatedly call the `addCreditors` function to add 350 new addresses to the `creditorAddresses` array, and then call the `emptyCreditors` function to reset the array to a length of 1500 or less. This process can be repeated indefinitely, causing the contract to be stuck in a state where the `win` variable is never set to true.

To fix this vulnerability, the condition in the `emptyCreditors` function should be changed to allow the `win` state to be set to true when the `creditorAddresses` array reaches a certain length, regardless of the number of addresses in the array.",1270,263,10.93768835067749
134,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles dynamic array resizing. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the array is being resized:


```solidity

if(numElements == array.length) {

    array.length += 1;

}

```


In Solidity, when you try to resize an array using the `+=` operator on the `.length` property, it does not actually resize the array. Instead, it creates a new array with the new length and copies the old elements over. This operation is gas-intensive and can be exploited by an attacker to deplete the gas available to the contract, leading to a Denial of Service.


To fix this vulnerability, you should use the `push` method to add elements to the array, which handles resizing internally and is more gas-efficient:


```solidity

for(uint i=0;i<numbers;i++) {

    array.push(value);

}

```


By using the `push` method, you avoid the gas-intensive operation of manually resizing the array and mitrighten the contract against Denial of Service attacks.",1397,295,12.260434865951538
135,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the lines where the creditorAddresses and creditorAmounts arrays are reset to a new array with zero length:

creditorAddresses = new address[](0);
creditorAmounts = new uint[](0);

This vulnerability can be exploited by repeatedly calling the lendGovernmentMoney function, which will reset the arrays and cause the contract to lose track of the creditor addresses and amounts. This can lead to a situation where the contract is unable to process new transactions or return funds to creditors, effectively causing a DoS attack.

In a DoS attack, an attacker can repeatedly call the lendGovernmentMoney function, causing the contract to reset the arrays and lose track of the creditor addresses and amounts. This can lead to a situation where the contract is unable to process new transactions or return funds to creditors, effectively causing a DoS attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a more efficient data structure, such as a mapping, to keep track of the creditor addresses and amounts. This would prevent the arrays from being reset and ensure that the contract can continue to process transactions and return funds to creditors.",2821,279,12.363344192504883
136,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the same issue as the first contract. The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));
```

This line attempts to send Ether to each address in the `refundAddresses` array. If any of these addresses fail to accept the transaction (e.g., due to an error or a malicious intent), the entire transaction will fail, and the funds will be stuck in the contract. This can lead to a Denial of Service attack, as the contract will not be able to perform any further actions until the issue is resolved.

To fix this vulnerability, you can consider implementing a retry mechanism or handling the failure gracefully instead of relying on the `require` statement.",1297,208,8.715404987335205
137,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `ifillArray` function. This function allows any user to push up to 350 addresses into the `listAddresses` array, which can be exploited to fill up the contract's storage with a large number of addresses. This can lead to a DoS attack by consuming the contract's storage and potentially causing issues with other functions that rely on the `listAddresses` array.",1115,110,4.706115245819092
138,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the use of the `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid))` statement in the `bid` function. This line of code attempts to send the current bid amount to the current frontrunner. If the current frontrunner's address is not set (i.e., it is `0x0`), the `send` function will fail, causing the transaction to revert. An attacker can exploit this by continuously calling the `bid` function with a small amount of Ether, ensuring that the `currentFrontrunner` is never set to a valid address, thus preventing the contract from processing any legitimate bids.",1105,170,7.154073238372803
