The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. The `onlyowner` modifier uses `msg.sender == owner` to restrict access to the `withdraw` function, but it does not prevent an attacker from calling this function through a contract that forwards the call to the `withdraw` function. This is because `msg.sender` will be the address of the forwarding contract, not the original attacker.

To fix this vulnerability, you should replace the `onlyowner` modifier with a more secure access control mechanism, such as using a whitelist of authorized addresses or implementing a proxy pattern with a separate contract to handle access control.",1378,157,6.6665661334991455

14,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `migrateTo` function, which allows the `creator` to transfer the contract's balance to any address. Since the `creator` is not checked for any specific permissions or roles, any user who can call the `migrateTo` function can potentially drain the contract's funds. This is a significant access control vulnerability because it allows unauthorized users to perform actions that should be restricted to the contract creator or a specific role.",1580,120,5.216953992843628
15,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. The `onlyowner` modifier uses `msg.sender` to check if the caller is the owner, but this can be bypassed if the contract is called through a contract that forwards the call. In such cases, `msg.sender` would be the address of the forwarding contract, not the actual caller. This can lead to unauthorized access to the contract's functionality.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the `owner` address to check if the caller is the owner, and not rely on `msg.sender`. Here's an updated version of the `onlyowner` modifier:

```solidity
modifier onlyowner {
    require(msg.sender == owner, ""Caller is not the owner"");
    _;
}
```

Additionally, it's recommended to use the `own` keyword to declare the `owner` variable, which automatically sets the visibility to `private` and makes it read-only after the constructor. This helps prevent accidental modification of the `owner` address.

```solidity
own address private owner;
```

By making these changes, you can ensure that the access control is more secure and less prone to bypasses.",1395,293,12.170415163040161
16,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `set` function, where the contract allows anyone to modify the `map` array by calling the `set` function. This means that any user can overwrite the values in the `map` array, which could lead to unintended consequences or manipulation of the contract's state.

To fix this vulnerability, the `set` function should be restricted to only allow the `owner` to modify the `map` array. This can be done by adding a condition to check if the `msg.sender` is equal to the `owner` before allowing the modification. Here's an example of how the `set` function can be modified to fix the access control issue:

```solidity
function set(uint256 key, uint256 value) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, ""Only the owner can modify the map"");
    if (map.length <= key) {
        map.length = key + 1;
    }
    map[key] = value;
}
```

By adding this condition, the contract will now only allow the `owner` to modify the `map` array, thus fixing the access control vulnerability.",1480,279,11.662365674972534
17,access control," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in the `Proxy` contract. The `delegatecall` function allows a contract to execute code in the context of another contract, meaning it can access and modify the state of the target contract. If an attacker can control the `callee` address passed to the `forward` function, they could potentially exploit this to manipulate the state of the `callee` contract or cause unintended behavior.

In this case, the `Proxy` contract does not have any access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized contracts can be called through it. This makes it vulnerable to access control issues, as an attacker could create a malicious contract and pass its address to the `forward` function, leading to potential exploitation.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `Proxy` contract should implement access control mechanisms, such as using the `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict the use of the `forward` function to only the owner of the contract or other authorized addresses. Additionally, it is essential to ensure that the `callee` address is trusted and not controlled by an attacker.",1332,254,10.599752187728882
18,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control, which can be bypassed by a malicious actor. The `tx.origin` is a global variable in Solidity that refers to the original transaction sender, not the current user. However, it is not recommended to use `tx.origin` for access control because it can be easily exploited.

In this contract, the `PushBonusCode` function is public and can be called by any user, but there is no access control mechanism to restrict who can push bonus codes. This means that any user can add bonus codes to the `bonusCodes` array, which could lead to unauthorized access to the bonus codes.

To fix this vulnerability, you should implement proper access control mechanisms, such as using a whitelist of authorized addresses or implementing a role-based access control system.",1614,202,8.557713985443115

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. The `onlyowner` modifier uses `msg.sender` to check if the caller is the owner, but `msg.sender` can be spoofed by a contract calling this contract. This means that any contract can call the `withdraw` function and transfer the contract's balance to itself, bypassing the intended access control.",1381,99,4.311385631561279

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `migrateTo` function, which allows the `creator` to transfer the entire balance of the contract to any address. Since the `creator` is set in the `initWallet` function and is not restricted or changed afterwards, any user who calls the `initWallet` function can become the `creator` and then call the `migrateTo` function to drain the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `creator` should be set to a specific address (e.g., the owner's address) and not be changeable by any user. Additionally, the `migrateTo` function should be restricted to only the `creator` or an authorized address, and not callable by any other user.",1607,187,7.934405088424683
21,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `tx.origin` for access control in line 20. The `tx.origin` property refers to the original transaction sender, which can be problematic in scenarios where users are interacting with the contract through a trusted third party or a smart contract. In such cases, the `tx.origin` will not match the actual user, leading to potential unauthorized access.

A better approach for access control would be to use a modifier that checks if the caller is the owner or a designated authorized address. This can be achieved by storing the authorized addresses in a mapping and using a modifier to check if the caller is in the authorized list.

Here's an example of how to implement a more secure access control mechanism:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract MyContract {
    address owner;
    mapping(address => bool) authorizedAddresses;

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(authorizedAddresses[msg.sender] || msg.sender == owner);

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` to validate callers, which can lead to access control bypasses. In the provided code, the `refund` function does not check the caller's address before sending funds back to the caller. This means that any user can call the `refund` function and receive the entire balance of the contract, leading to a potential loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `refund` function should be modified to check the caller's address before sending funds back. This can be done by adding a condition to ensure that the caller is the creator of the contract or by using a modifier to restrict access to the creator only.",1639,160,6.850402355194092

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `EVCChain` contract, specifically in the constructor function where it assigns initial balances to certain addresses. The addresses are hardcoded, and the contract does not check if the sender of the transaction is authorized to perform this action. This could potentially allow an attacker to deploy the contract and assign balances to arbitrary addresses, leading to unauthorized access and potential loss of funds.",1272,105,4.532315492630005

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `tx.origin` for access control in the `withdrawAll` function. This approach is considered insecure because `tx.origin` can be easily spoofed by a malicious actor. An attacker can create a contract that calls the `withdrawAll` function, and since the `tx.origin` will be the address of the attacker's contract, it will bypass the access control check, allowing the attacker to withdraw all funds from the contract.

A more secure approach would be to use a modifier that checks if the caller is the owner or to store the owner's address in a state variable and use it for the access control check.",1357,158,6.700628280639648

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in the `withdraw` and fallback functions without proper access control checks. This can lead to unauthorized access to the `FibonacciLib` contract's functions, potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate the `calculatedFibNumber` or call other functions within the `FibonacciLib` contract that should not be accessible.",1967,95,4.321176767349243
27,unchecked low level calls," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the low-level call function in the Command function without proper error checking. The line `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);` can fail silently if the call to the address `adr` does not execute as expected, potentially leading to a fail-open situation where the contract continues to execute without reverting the transaction. This can result in unexpected behavior and loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should check the return value of the call function and revert the transaction if the call fails. Here's an example of how to fix the vulnerability:

```
function Command(address adr,bytes data)
    payable
    public
    {
        require(msg.sender == Owner);

        (bool success, ) = adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);
        require(success, ""Call failed"");
    }
```

By adding the `require(success, ""Call failed"");` line, the contract will revert the transaction if the call fails, preventing any potential fail-open situations.",2602,247,10.997777223587036

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to unchecked low-level call functions, similar to the original code provided. The vulnerability lies in the following lines:

1. owner2.send(sum2);
2. owner.send(balance);

In both lines, the low-level send function is used without checking the return value. If the transaction fails, the contract will continue to execute, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

To fix this vulnerability, the send function should be replaced with a function that checks the return value, such as send() or transfer(), which are part of the ERC20 standard. These functions will revert the transaction if the transfer fails, preventing any further execution of the contract code.",2421,164,7.427093267440796

2. line 118: `msg.sender.send(excessPaid);`
3. line 132: `currentMonarch.etherAddress.send(compensation);`

In each of these lines, the `send()` function is called without checking the return value. If the recipient address is not a contract or the recipient contract reverts during the execution of the function, the transaction will fail, and the remaining gas will be refunded to the sender. However, the current code does not handle this case, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

To fix this issue, you should use the `transfer()` function instead of `send()`, as it reverts the transaction and consumes all remaining gas if the transfer fails. Alternatively, you can use the `call()` function and check the return value to handle the failure case properly.",3586,242,11.009223461151123

The provided code is vulnerable due to the use of the `send` function in the `cash` function (line 141). The `send` function is a low-level transfer function that does not revert the transaction if the transfer fails due to insufficient funds or if the recipient address is not a valid Ethereum address. This can lead to a situation where the contract sends Ether to an invalid address or when the sender does not have enough Ether, but the transaction is not reverted, potentially leading to loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the `transfer` function instead of `send`. The `transfer` function will revert the transaction if the transfer fails, providing better error handling and preventing potential loss of funds.

Here's the updated `cash` function using the `transfer` function:

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to unchecked low-level calls. The vulnerability lies in the `sendMoney` function, specifically in the line:

_target.call.value(_value)(_data);

This line uses the low-level `call.value` function to send Ether and data to the `_target` address. If the `_target` address is a contract, the `_data` parameter can be used to pass a function selector and arguments to the contract's function. However, if the `_target` address is not a contract or the function does not exist, the call will fail silently, and the Ether will be sent to the fallback function of the `_target` address.

This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds. To mitigate this vulnerability, the `sendMoney` function should be updated to use the `transfer` or `send` function for sending Ether, and the `call` function should be used with proper error checking for contract interactions.",1529,223,9.360673427581787

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to unchecked low-level calls. The vulnerability lies in the line where the `caddress.call` function is used:

```solidity
caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v[i]*1000000000000000000);
```

This line is making a low-level call to the `caddress` contract, which can potentially lead to a failure in the execution of the function. The Solidity documentation warns that low-level calls do not propagate errors and will not lead to a total reversion of the current execution. Instead, they will return a boolean value set to false, and the code will continue to run. This can surprise developers and lead to fail-opens and other unwanted outcomes.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the `call` function with proper error checking, or consider using a higher-level function like `transfer` or `send` that handles errors more gracefully.",1788,233,9.82935881614685

This line sends Ether to the target address without checking the success of the call. If the call fails, the Ether will still be sent, potentially leading to a loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the `call` function with proper error checking, like this:

```solidity

The given code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. Although the SafeMath library is used to prevent such issues, the vulnerability still exists in the `transfer` function of the `Token` contract. The issue is that the `transfer` function does not check if the sender has enough balance before attempting to subtract the `_value` from the sender's balance. This can lead to an integer underflow if the sender's balance is already zero.

To fix this vulnerability, the `transfer` function should be updated to use SafeMath's sub function for the subtraction operation, like this:

The `transfer` function in `IntegerOverflowAdd` is not using SafeMath and is directly performing arithmetic operations without any checks for overflow or underflow. This means that if the balance of an account is very large, subtracting the transfer amount could cause an underflow, or adding the transfer amount to another account's balance could cause an overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, the `transfer` function should be updated to use SafeMath operations, like so:

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the same reason as the first one: bad randomness. The vulnerability lies in line 35:

bytes32 answer = blockhash(guesses[msg.sender].block);

The `blockhash` function returns the hash of a block, which is predictable to some extent. Miners have some influence over the block hash, and they can potentially predict or manipulate the hash of a future block. This predictability can be exploited by a malicious user who can replicate the function's unpredictability and attack the contract.

In this case, a malicious user could potentially predict the block number that the contract will use to generate the `answer` variable. By doing so, they could lock in a guess that matches the predicted block hash, allowing them to win the 2 ether reward.",1657,187,7.950521230697632

The given Ethraffle_v4b smart contract is vulnerable due to the use of block.coinbase and block.difficulty in the chooseWinner function. These values can be manipulated by miners, allowing them to potentially predict the outcome of the raffle.

In the chooseWinner function, the seed1 and seed2 variables are derived from the block.coinbase and msg.sender addresses, respectively. The block.coinbase address can be manipulated by miners, as they can choose any address as their coinbase. Similarly, the msg.sender address can be manipulated by the caller of the function, which could be a miner or another contract controlled by a miner.

The seed3 variable is derived from the block.difficulty, which can also be manipulated by miners. Miners have the ability to mine blocks with different difficulty levels, and they can choose to mine blocks with a specific difficulty to influence the outcome of the raffle.

By manipulating these variables, miners can potentially predict the winning address and claim the prize before the raffle is officially announced. This vulnerability can be exploited by miners or other malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage in the raffle.",3816,273,12.37953519821167

This line allows the `withdraw` function to be called recursively by an untrusted contract before the state change (balance update) is completed. This can lead to multiple withdrawals being executed in a single transaction, potentially draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you should update the `withdraw` function to follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern, where you first perform all necessary checks and state changes before interacting with external contracts. Here's an example of a fixed `withdraw` function:

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability still lies in line 19, where the `msg.sender.call.value(amount)()` is used to send Ether to the `msg.sender`. This allows the `msg.sender` to potentially call back into the `withdraw` function before the state change of subtracting the `amount` from `credit[msg.sender]` is completed. This can lead to multiple withdrawals or other unintended behaviors.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests that you should first perform all checks and effects (state changes) before interacting with other contracts. In this case, you should subtract the `amount` from `credit[msg.sender]` before making the external call.

In the `getFirstWithdrawalBonus` function, the `withdrawReward` function is called before updating the `claimedBonus` state. This allows an attacker to call the `getFirstWithdrawalBonus` function again during the execution of the `withdrawReward` function, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the `withdrawReward` function should be called after updating the `claimedBonus` state, like this:

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This line allows the external contract to make a recursive call back to the `Collect` function before the initial execution is complete. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.

In the `Collect` function, the contract checks if the sender's balance is greater than or equal to the minimum sum and the amount they want to collect. If these conditions are met, the contract allows the sender to call the `Collect` function again with the specified amount. This recursive call can be exploited by an attacker to repeatedly withdraw funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the state (e.g., balance) before making the external call. This can be achieved by changing the order of operations in the `Collect` function:

```solidity
function Collect(uint _am)

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to the same reentrancy attack as the first code snippet. The vulnerability lies in the same line: if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

In the Collect function, the contract sends Ether to the caller (msg.sender) before updating the balance. This allows the caller to potentially call back into the contract before the balance is updated, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance before sending Ether to the caller. Here's an example of how the Collect function can be modified to prevent the reentrancy attack:

```solidity
function Collect(uint _am)

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the same reentrancy attack as the first code snippet. The vulnerability lies in the `WithdrawToHolder` function in the `TokenBank` contract. The line `if(_addr.call.value(_wei)())` allows for a reentrant call, which can be exploited by an attacker.

In this function, the contract sends Ether to the `_addr` address and then checks if the balance of `_addr` is greater than 0. If the balance is greater than 0, the contract decreases the balance by `_wei`. However, the reentrancy vulnerability occurs because the external call to `_addr` is made before the balance is updated. An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the `WithdrawToHolder` function and then calls another function in the malicious contract, effectively re-entering the `WithdrawToHolder` function before the balance update. This can lead to multiple withdrawals and potential loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the balance update should be done before the external call, or the external call should be replaced with a non-reentrant call like `callSafeTransfer`.",2218,262,11.524144649505615

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the Reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `airDrop()` function of the `ModifierEntrancy` contract. The `airDrop()` function modifies the state of the contract by increasing the token balance of the `msg.sender` without any checks to prevent reentrancy.

In the `attack` contract, the `supportsToken()` function calls `ModifierEntrancy(msg.sender).airDrop()` without any checks to prevent reentrancy. This allows an attacker to create a malicious contract that calls the `supportsToken()` function and then calls the `airDrop()` function in a recursive manner, draining the funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `airDrop()` function should be modified to use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, where the state changes are performed before making external calls. This can be achieved by changing the order of the modifiers in the `airDrop()` function:

```solidity
function airDrop() hasNoBalance supportsToken  public{
    tokenBalance[msg.sender] += 20;

The vulnerability lies in line 18: `require(now!= pastBlockTime);` // only 1 transaction per block

The vulnerability lies in line 20: `pastBlockTime = now;`

The issue is that the contract relies on the `now` timestamp to determine when to transfer the token balance to the sender. Miners can manipulate the timestamp within a certain range, which can allow them to trigger the transfer condition prematurely or delay it. This can lead to funds being transferred at unintended times or not at all.",1426,150,6.3848717212677
131,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same line as the previous code:

var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;

This line uses block.timestamp to generate a random number, which can be manipulated by miners. An attacker with control over the mining process could manipulate the block timestamp to influence the outcome of the random number generation, potentially affecting the distribution of winnings in the EtherLotto game.

To mitigate this vulnerability, a more secure random number generation method should be used, such as utilizing a decentralized randomness beacon or combining multiple sources of randomness.",1640,154,6.614814281463623
132,short addresses," NO

The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to short address attacks. The vulnerability in the original code was due to the incorrect handling of addresses in the `sendCoin` function. However, in the provided code, the `sendCoin` function correctly uses the `address` type for the `to` parameter, which mitigates the risk of short address attacks.",1633,81,3.6642589569091797
133,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `addCreditors` function, which allows any user to add up to 350 addresses to the `creditorAddresses` array. An attacker can repeatedly call this function to fill the array, potentially causing the contract to run out of gas when trying to execute the `emptyCreditors` function.

When the `creditorAddresses.length` exceeds 1500, the `emptyCreditors` function is called, which attempts to reinitialize the `creditorAddresses` array to an empty array. However, this operation requires a significant amount of gas, and if the array is too large, the transaction may fail due to insufficient gas. This can lead to a Denial of Service attack, as the contract becomes unresponsive and may not be able to process new transactions.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you can implement a limit on the number of addresses that can be added to the `creditorAddresses` array or use a more efficient data structure to store the addresses. Additionally, you can optimize the `emptyCreditors` function to avoid reinitializing the entire array when it becomes too large.",1598,271,11.319069862365723
134,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles dynamic array resizing. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the contract does not properly handle the case when the array is full and a new element is being added.

The vulnerability is present in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines:

```solidity
for(uint i=0;i<numbers;i++) {
    if(numElements == array.length) {
        array.length += 1;
    }
    array[numElements++] = value;
}
```

When the array is full, the code attempts to increase the array's length by 1, but this operation does not actually allocate new memory for the array. Instead, it only updates the length variable. This means that when trying to write to the array at the new index, it will overwrite the data at the previous index, leading to data corruption and potential DoS attacks.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use the `push` method to add elements to the array, which will automatically handle the resizing and memory allocation:

```solidity
for(uint i=0;i<numbers;i++) {
    array.push(value);
}
```

This change will ensure that the array",1725,301,12.5317542552948
135,denial of service," YES

The given code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the lines:

creditorAddresses = new address[](0);
creditorAmounts = new uint[](0);

These lines reset the creditorAddresses and creditorAmounts arrays to empty arrays, which can be exploited by an attacker to repeatedly call the lendGovernmentMoney function and drain the contract's funds.

An attacker can send transactions to the lendGovernmentMoney function with a small amount of Ether, which will trigger the reset of the arrays and allow the attacker to repeatedly call the function without being detected. This can lead to a denial of service attack, as the contract will be unable to process legitimate transactions due to the constant resetting of the arrays.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a more secure data structure, such as a mapping, to store the creditor addresses and amounts. This would prevent an attacker from easily draining the contract's funds and causing a denial of service.",3149,237,10.703302145004272
136,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the same reason as the first contract. The vulnerability lies in the line where it sends Ether to the refund addresses:

require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));

If any of the refundAddresses[x] does not accept the transaction or fails to send the Ether, the entire refundAll function will fail and hold up all funds. This can be exploited by an attacker to prevent the contract from executing its intended functionality.",1625,131,5.688960790634155
137,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `ifillArray` function. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the function allows any user to fill the `listAddresses` array with up to 350 of their addresses, as long as the array's length is less than 1500. This can be exploited by a malicious user to fill the array with their addresses, potentially causing the contract to run out of storage space and leading to a DoS condition.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you can limit the number of addresses that can be added to the array in a single transaction or implement a rate-limiting mechanism to prevent abuse. Additionally, you can consider using a more efficient data structure or storage mechanism to handle a large number of addresses.",1443,182,7.681575298309326
138,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the same issue as the first contract. The vulnerability lies in the line:

```solidity
require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));
```

This line attempts to send the current bid amount to the current frontrunner. If the current frontrunner's address is a contract that does not have a fallback function or a receive function, the transaction will fail, and the bid function will revert. This can be exploited by an attacker to repeatedly call the bid function with a higher bid, causing the contract to revert and effectively taking the auction offline.

To fix this vulnerability, you can remove the line that sends the current bid to the current frontrunner or ensure that the current frontrunner's contract has a fallback function or a receive function to handle incoming ether transfers.",1433,214,9.000641345977783
