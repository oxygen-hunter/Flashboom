The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control, which can be bypassed by contracts that call this contract.

12,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control, which can be exploited through a technique called ""identity-based attacks."" In this case, the `onlyowner` modifier is used to restrict access to the `withdraw` function, but it relies on the `msg.sender` variable, which is not sufficient for secure access control.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a contract that calls the `withdraw` function of the `Missing` contract. The attacker's contract would look like this:

```solidity
contract Attacker {
    function exploit() public {
        Missing.withdraw();
    }
}
```

When the `exploit` function is called, the `msg.sender` will be the address of the `Attacker` contract, not the actual owner of the `Missing` contract. This allows the attacker to withdraw funds from the `Missing` contract, even though they are not the owner.

To fix this vulnerability, the `onlyowner` modifier should be updated to use a more secure access control mechanism, such as using a mapping to store the owner's address and checking against it in the modifier.",1519,281,11.691530466079712
13,access control," YES

The given smart contract is vulnerable due to the use of the `owner` modifier in the `mintForwarder` function. This modifier allows any contract or account to call the `mintForwarder` function as long as they are the owner of the contract. This can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the contract's state.

In the `mintForwarder` function, the `owner` modifier is used to check if the `proxyMinter` address is the owner of the contract. If it is, the function proceeds to mint tokens and potentially change the king. This means that any contract or account that can change the `owner` of the contract can also mint tokens and change the king, which is a significant security risk.

To fix this vulnerability, the `owner` modifier should be removed from the `mintForwarder` function, and the minting functionality should be restricted to a specific function or role that is not exposed to external contracts or accounts.",4180,223,10.379719734191895

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for authorization checks, which can be exploited through a technique called ""identity theft"" or ""identity spoofing."" This vulnerability arises because `tx.origin` returns the address of the external account that initiated the transaction, not the address of the contract that is executing the transaction. An attacker can create a contract that calls the `migrateTo` function of the `Wallet` contract, and since the `migrateTo` function only checks if the `creator` matches `msg.sender`, it will allow the attacker's contract to transfer the entire balance of the `Wallet` contract to the attacker's address.

To fix this vulnerability, the `Wallet` contract should use a more secure method for authorization checks, such as using a modifier that checks if the `msg.sender` is the owner of the contract or implementing a more robust access control mechanism.",1721,218,9.203406810760498

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control, which can be bypassed by a malicious actor. The `onlyowner` modifier uses `msg.sender` to check if the caller is the owner, but if an attacker can trick the contract into calling itself (or another contract that calls it), they can bypass this check. This is because `msg.sender` will be the address of the contract that called the function, not the original user.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use a more secure access control mechanism, such as using a mapping to store the owner's address and checking against that, or using a signed message or a nonce to ensure that only the owner can call certain functions.",1536,169,7.177038192749023

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable due to the lack of proper access control mechanisms. The `mintForwarder` function in the `DoubleKingsReward` contract allows any caller to mint tokens as long as they have the `proxyMintArray` which contains the addresses of the proxy minters. There is no check to ensure that the caller has the necessary permissions to perform this action.

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in the `forward` function of the `Proxy` contract. This can lead to an access control vulnerability if the `callee` address is not properly verified or if it is controlled by an attacker. The `delegatecall` allows the `callee` contract to execute in the context of the `Proxy` contract, which means it can access and modify the `Proxy` contract's state if not properly secured. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or functions within the `Proxy` contract.",1473,129,5.563068628311157

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for authorization checks, which can be bypassed by a malicious actor. In Solidity versions prior to 0.6.0, `tx.origin` was used to identify the original sender of a transaction. However, it was found that this could be exploited through the use of contracts that forward transactions, allowing an attacker to call the contract with a different `tx.origin`.

In the given code, the `mintForwarder` function in the `DoubleKingsReward` contract does not perform any authorization checks on the `proxyMintArray` input. This means that an attacker could create a malicious contract that forwards the `mintForwarder` call to the `DoubleKingsReward` contract with a different `tx.origin`, effectively bypassing the authorization checks and potentially causing unintended behavior.

To fix this vulnerability, the `mintForwarder` function should perform authorization checks on the `proxyMintArray` input, ensuring that the caller of the function is authorized to perform the action. Additionally, it is recommended to avoid using `tx.origin` for authorization checks in Solidity versions 0.6.0 and above, as it has been deprecated and can lead to vulnerabilities.",1755,297,12.428375482559204

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control, which can be exploited through a technique called ""identity-based attacks."" In this case, the `onlyowner` modifier is used to restrict access to the `withdraw` function, but it relies on `msg.sender` to determine the caller's identity.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a contract that calls the `withdraw` function of the target contract. The `msg.sender` in this case would be the attacker's contract, not the actual owner. Since the `onlyowner` modifier only checks the `msg.sender` and not the actual owner of the contract, the attacker would be able to withdraw funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a mapping to store the owner's address and verify the caller's identity against the stored owner's address instead of relying on `msg.sender`.",1522,219,9.216503381729126

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `tx.origin` for access control in line 20. The `tx.origin` property refers to the original transaction sender, which can be problematic in scenarios where users interact with the contract through a trusted third-party service or a wallet that supports contract calls. In such cases, the `tx.origin` will not be the actual owner of the contract, leading to potential unauthorized access.

A better approach for access control would be to use a modifier that checks if the caller is the owner, like this:

```solidity
modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner, ""Not the owner"");
    _;
}

function sendTo(address receiver, uint amount) public onlyOwner {
    receiver.transfer(amount);
}
```

This way, the access control is based on the `msg.sender` property, which represents the actual caller of the function, ensuming that the contract is only called through trusted services or wallets.",1466,238,9.918028116226196

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `msg.sender` in the `refund` function without proper access control checks. This allows any user who has a non-zero balance in the contract to call the `refund` function and transfer their entire balance to themselves, effectively draining the contract's funds.",1780,74,3.3995890617370605
23,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `mintForwarder` function of the `DoubleKingsReward` contract. The issue is that the contract allows the owner to mint tokens and potentially change the king by sending a single transaction.

The problematic part is the following code snippet:

```solidity
if (miningKing == newKing) {
  uint balance = ERC20Interface(minedToken).balanceOf(this);
  require(ERC20Interface(minedToken).transfer(newKing, balance));
}
```

In this code, the contract checks if the new king (generated from the nonce) is the same as the current king. If they are the same, the contract transfers all the tokens from the contract to the new king. This allows the owner to mint tokens and change the king by sending a single transaction, which is a severe vulnerability.

To fix this issue, the contract should not allow the owner to mint tokens and change the king in the same transaction. A possible solution is to separate the minting and king-changing functionalities into different transactions.",1413,259,10.82528805732727

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `changeOwner` function, which allows anyone to change the owner of the contract. This is a critical security flaw because it means that the ownership of the contract can be transferred without proper authorization.

The `changeOwner` function does not have the `onlyOwner` modifier applied, which means that any user can call this function and change the `owner` variable to their address. This can lead to unauthorized control over the contract's functionality and assets.

To fix this vulnerability, the `changeOwner` function should be modified to include the `onlyOwner` modifier, ensuring that only the current owner can change the ownership of the contract. Here's an example of how the function should be modified:

```solidity
function changeOwner(address _newOwner) public onlyOwner {
    owner = _newOwner;
}
```

By adding the `onlyOwner` modifier, the function will now only be callable by the current owner, preventing unautrighted users from changing the ownership of the contract.",1517,250,10.479937314987183

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the use of `tx.origin` to check the caller's address in the `withdrawAll` function. The `tx.origin` property returns the address of the externally owned account (EOA) that initiated the transaction, not the address of the contract that called the function. This can be exploited by a malicious contract that calls the `withdrawAll` function, as it would pass the check and allow the funds to be withdrapta to the attacker's address.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a more secure method of access control, such as using a modifier that checks the caller's address against a whitelist of authorized addresses or using the `msg.sender` property to check the address of the contract that called the function.",1498,190,8.042408227920532

In each of these lines, the code is using the `send()` function, which is a low-level call that can fail silently. If the recipient address is not a contract or if the recipient contract reverts during the execution of the function, the `send()` function will return false without reverting the entire transaction. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the `transfer()` function instead of `send()`, as `transfer()` reverts the entire transaction if the transfer fails. The updated lines would look like this:

This can result in the recipient's balance being set to zero, which is a vulnerability.

Similarly, the `transfer` function in the fallback function also has the same issue with the gas limit. This can lead to the same vulnerability as mentioned above.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the `transfer` function from the `ERC20` interface, which allows for a higher gas limit and ensures that the recipient's balance is not set to zero if the transfer amount exceeds their balance.",3844,218,10.068418979644775

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should check the return value of the `.call.value()` function and handle the failure case appropriellesly. Here's an example of how to fix the vulnerability:

```solidity
function sendMoney(address _target, uint _value, bytes _data) public onlyOwner {
    (bool success, ) = _target.call.value(_value)(_data);
    require(success, ""Failed to send money"");
}
```

By checking the return value of the `.call.value()` function and using the `require` statement, we can ensure that the function only proceeds if the call was successful, preventing potential fail-opens and other unwanted outcomes.",1670,255,10.734350442886353

This line is calling a low-level function `call` on the `caddress` variable, which is not a contract but an address. The `call` function is used to send Ether and/or call functions on the contract at the address `caddress`. However, the return value of this function is not checked. If the call fails, it will return `false`, but the code will continue to execute without handling the failure. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities, such as reentrancy attacks or fail-open scenarios.

In the provided code, the vulnerability is not directly related to the lines mentioned in the question (lines 23 and 31). Instead, the vulnerability is due to the overall design of the contract, which allows for the possibility of front-running. The contract does not implement any mechanism to prevent or mitigate front-running attacks.

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to front running. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `play` function is payable and can be called by any user, and the outcome of the game (who wins the ether) is determined by the order of transactions. Since miners can prioritize transactions with higher gas fees, a malicious user can observe the pending transactions and submit their own transaction with a higher fee to be mined first, effectively stealing the winnings.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should not allow users to submit their transactions in a way that can be influenced by the order of transactions. One way to do this is by using a commit-reveal scheme, where users commit their choices without revealing them and then reveal their choices in a second phase, with the contract determining the winner based on the revealed choices.

uint previousEpochCount = ERC918Interface(minedToken).epochCount();
```

and the subsequent line:

```solidity
require(ERC918Interface(minedToken).epochCount() == previousEpochCount.add(1));

The add function from the SafeMath library is used to increment the epochCount by 1. However, if the epochCount is at its maximum value (2^256 - 1), adding 1 to it will cause an integer overflow, resulting in the epochCount wrapping around to 0. This can lead to incorrect behavior in the contract, such as incorrectly identifying the mining king or causing other unintended consequences.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library's checkedAdd function, which returns a boolean indicating whether the operation resulted in an overflow. Here's an updated version of the mintForwarder function:

If the balance of the new king is very large, the subtraction operation in the `require` statement can cause an integer underflow, leading to an incorrect balance value. This can potentially be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the contract's behavior.

Additionally, the `uintToBytesForAddress` and `bytesToAddress` functions have potential issues with integer overflow and underflow. In `uintToBytesForAddress`, the division operation can cause an integer underflow if `x` is very small. In `bytesToAddress`, the multiplication operation can cause an integer overflow if `c` is very large.

This could potentially allow a user to withdraw funds before the intended time.

Additionally, the `uint` type used in Solidity is unsigned, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. If an underflow occurs, it could also lead to incorrect behavior in the contract.

This can lead to incorrect behavior in the contract, such as incorrectly identifying the new king or causing issues with the token balance calculations.

Additionally, the contract uses the `SafeMath` library for the `DoubleKingsReward` contract, which is a good practice to prevent integer overflows.

```solidity
require(proxyMintArray.length == 1) {
  require(proxyMinterInterface(proxyMinter).proxyMint(nonce, challenge_digest));
}
```

In this case, the `proxyMint` function is called with the `nonce` and `challenge_digest` parameters. If the `nonce` value is large enough, it can cause an integer overflow when added to the current epoch count in the `ERC918Interface(minedToken).epochCount()` function call.

The `epochCount()` function is called twice, once before and once after the `proxyMint` function call. If an integer overflow occurs, the `epochCount()` function will return an incorrect value, which can lead to incorrect behavior in the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the SafeMath library's `add` function to safely add the `nonce` value to the epoch count:

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow due to the use of the Solidity `uint` type without proper overflow checks. Although the SafeMath library is used, which should prevent such vulnerabilities, the contract still contains a potential issue in the `uintToBytesForAddress` function.

In the `uintToBytesForAddress` function, the loop iterates from 0 to 19, which means it will attempt to access `b[20]`, which is out of bounds for a 20-element array. This can lead to an unexpected behavior or even a potential vulnerability if the out-of-bounds access is exploited.

To fix this issue, the loop should iterate from 0 to 19, and the function should be updated as follows:

This allows an attacker to recursively call the `mintForwarder` function before the state changes (the balance update) are completed, potentially draining funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, where all state changes (effects) are performed before any external calls (interactions) are made.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the same reentrancy attack as the first example. The vulnerability lies in the line:

```solidity

This line allows the `msg.sender` to make a new external call to the `CashOut` function before the initial execution is complete. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploitation of the contract.

In the `CashOut` function, the contract checks if the sender has enough balance and if the current block number is greater than the last recorded block number. If these conditions are met, it proceeds to send the requested amount to the sender. However, the vulnerability arises when the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` line is executed.

If an attacker calls the `CashOut` function and then quickly calls another function in their contract that calls back into the `CashOut` function, the attacker can drain the contract's funds. This is because the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` line allows the attacker to make a new external call to the `CashOut` function before the initial execution is complete.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the use of block.timestamp for both the time-based condition in the payOut function and the random number generation in the randomGen function.

In the payOut function, the condition `if ( rand> 0 && now - rand > 24 hours )` relies on the current time (`now`) and the provided random number (`rand`). An attacker can manipulate the block timestamp to bypass this condition and receive funds.

In the randomGen function, block.timestamp is used to generate a random number. Since miners have control over the block timestamp, they can influence the randomness of the generated number, leading to predictable or biased outcomes.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, it is recommended to use a more reliable source of time and randomness, such as an external oracle or a decentralized randomness beacon.",1715,203,8.610492467880249
129,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `resetInvestment` function, where the condition `if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp + ONE_MINUTE) throw;` is used to prevent resetting the investment before a minute has passed since the last investment. However, miners can manipulate the `block.timestamp` value, which can be exploited by an attacker to reset the investment prematurely.",1995,107,4.879237651824951
130,time manipulation," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the use of `now` (block.timestamp) to determine when certain actions can occur, such as transferring funds. Miners have some leeway in setting the timestamp, which can be exploited to manipulate the outcome of time-based conditions in the contract.",1567,77,3.4860546588897705
131,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same line as the previous code, line 43:

var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;

This line uses block.timestamp to generate a random number, which can be manipulated by miners. An attacker with control over the mining process could manipulate the block timestamp to influence the outcome of the random number generation, potentially affecting the distribution of winnings in the EtherLotto game.",1781,118,5.175425052642822
132,short addresses," NO


The provided smart contract code does not appear to be vulnerable to short address attacks. The vulnerability mentioned in the initial code review is related to the incorrect handling of addresses in the `sendCoin` function. However, in the provided code, the `sendCoin` function correctly uses the `address` type for the `to` parameter, which should prevent the short address issue.",1774,84,3.803572654724121
133,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the function does not check if the contract is already in the state where `creditorAddresses` is empty before attempting to clear it. If an attacker calls the `emptyCreditors` function when `creditorAddresses` is already empty, it will still execute the code within the function, potentially causing unnecessary gas consumption and leading to a DoS attack.

To fix this vulnerability, you can add a condition to check if `creditorAddresses` is already empty before clearing it:

```solidity
function emptyCreditors() public {
    if(creditorAddresses.length > 1500) {
        creditorAddresses = new address[](0);
        win = true;
    }
}
```

Change it to:

```solidity
function emptyCreditors() public {
    if(creditorAddresses.length > 1500) {
        creditorAddresses = new address[](0);
        win = true;
    }
}
```

This will prevent the function from being called when `creditorAddresses` is already empty, thus mitigating the DoS vulnerability.",1739,298,12.4573495388031
134,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles array resizing. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the contract checks if `numElements` is equal to `array.length` and then increments `array.length` by 1. This can lead to an infinite loop if the contract is called with a large enough `numbers` value, as the condition `numElements == array.length` will always be true, causing the contract to keep increasing the `array.length` indefinitely.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use the `uint256[]` type for the `array` variable, which automatically resizes when new elements are added. This can be done by changing the `array` declaration to `uint256[] public array;` and removing the manual resizing logic.",1866,200,8.548865795135498
135,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the lines:

     creditorAddresses = new address[](0);
     
     creditorAmounts = new uint[](0);

These lines reset the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays to empty arrays, effectively removing all creditor addresses and amounts from the contract state. This can be exploited by repeatedly calling the `lendGovernmentMoney` function, which will continuously clear the arrays and prevent legitimate creditors from receiving their funds.

An attacker can repeatedly call the `lendGovernmentMoney` function with a small amount of Ether, causing the contract to reset the arrays and preventing legitimate creditors from receiving their funds. This can lead to a denial of service, as the contract will be unable to process legitimate transactions.",3290,205,9.37013578414917
136,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the use of the `require` statement in the `refundAll` function. If any of the `send` operations fail, the entire transaction will revert, causing all previous `send` operations in the loop to fail as well. This can lead to a denial of service if an attacker can control or influence the addresses in the `refundAddresses` array.",1766,98,4.360450744628906
137,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the potential for an attacker to repeatedly call the `ifillArray` function, which could lead to a significant consumption of gas and potentially exhaust the gas limit for transactions on the Ethereum network. This could prevent legitimate transactions from being processed, effectively taking the contract offline.",1584,83,3.723355293273926
138,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to the same issue as the original code snippet. The vulnerability lies in the function `mintForwarder` within the `miningKingContract`. The function requires that the `proxyMintArray` is not empty, and if it contains only one element, it calls `proxyMinterInterface(proxyMinter).proxyMint(nonce, challenge_digest)`. This is the same line that was identified as vulnerable in the original code snippet.

If an attacker can control the `proxyMintArray` and ensure it always contains only one element, they can repeatedly call the `mintForwarder` function, causing the contract to call `proxyMinterInterface(proxyMinter).proxyMint(nonce, challenge_digest)` indefinitely. This can lead to a denial of service as the contract will be stuck in this function call, unable to proceed with other operations.",1574,217,9.141381025314331
