The smart contract code provided is vulnerable due to the following reasons:

1. The `missing` function is public and does not have any access control, allowing anyone to set the `owner` address. This can lead to unauthorized control of the contract.

2. The `lock` function allows anyone to lock tokens without proper access control, which can lead to manipulation of the contract's state and potential loss of funds.

3. The `withdraw` function is public and has the `onlyowner` modifier, but it uses `owner.transfer(this.balance)` instead of `payable` or `transfer(address _to, uint256 _value)` which can lead to a reentrancy attack.

4. The contract uses the deprecated `tx.origin` to validate callers, which can be exploited by attackers.

5. The contract uses `delegatecall` in proxy libraries or proxy contracts, which can lead to unauthorized access to the contract's private logic.

6. The contract uses `require(now <= HOLDING_START)` in the `lock` function, which can be exploited by attackers to manipulate the contract's state.

7. The contract uses `SafeERC20` and `SafeMath` libraries, which can be exploited if",978,301,12.350972414016724

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the `creator` variable in the `DynamicPyramid` function. This function allows anyone to call it and set themselves as the creator of the contract, which can lead to unauthorized control over the contract's functions and state.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `tx.origin` in the `migrateTo` function, which can be exploited through a transaction forwarding attack.",1180,43,2.017671823501587
15,access control," YES

The smart contract code provided is vulnerable due to the use of `tx.origin` in the `onlyowner` modifier. However, in this specific code snippet, the `onlyowner` modifier is not actually using `tx.origin`. Instead, it is using `msg.sender`, which is the correct way to check the actual sender of the transaction. Therefore, based on the provided code, the access control vulnerability related to `tx.origin` is not present.

However, there is still a potential vulnerability in the `lock` function. The `lock` function allows anyone to lock tokens as long as the current time is less than or equal to `HOLDING_START`. This could potentially be exploited by an attacker who can manipulate the system time on their local machine.

Additionally, the `lock` function does not check if the `msg.sender` is the owner of the contract, which means that any user can call the `lock` function and lock tokens. This could lead to an attacker locking tokens without being the owner of the contract.

To fix these issues, you should add a check in the `lock` function to ensure that the `msg.sender` is the owner of the contract, and you should remove the time-based condition or implement a more secure time-based condition.",995,286,11.791993856430054

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `lock` function, specifically in the line where it updates the `lockBalanceOf` mapping:

```solidity
lockBalanceOf[msg.sender] = lockBalanceOf[msg.sender].add(lockAmount).add(reward);
```

This line allows any caller to update their balance in the `lockBalanceOf` mapping, which should only be possible for the owner of the contract. To fix this vulnerability, the `lock` function should be marked as `onlyOwner` or use a modifier that checks if the caller is the owner before executing the function.

Additionally, the `set` function is also vulnerable to access control issues. It allows any caller to update the `map` array, which should only be possible for the owner of the contract. To fix this vulnerability, the `set` function should be marked as `onlyOwner` or use a modifier that checks if the caller is the owner before executing the function.

In summary, the contract is vulnerable to access control issues because it allows any caller to update the `lockBalanceOf` and `map` mappings, which should only be possible for the owner of the contract.",1080,279,11.541120052337646

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control, which can be bypassed by a malicious actor. However, the provided code snippet does not contain the `tx.origin` usage, so we cannot directly identify a vulnerability based on the provided code.

But, there is a potential vulnerability in the `lock` function. The `lock` function allows anyone to lock tokens and receive rewards without proper access control. This could lead to an attack where an attacker calls the `lock` function and receives rewards without actually owning the tokens.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add access control to the `lock` function, ensuring that only the token owner or authorized users can call it.",1214,169,7.116404056549072
19,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. The `onlyowner` modifier checks if the `msg.sender` is equal to the `owner`, which is fine for direct transactions. However, if a contract is called through another contract, `msg.sender` will be the address of the calling contract, not the actual user. This can lead to unautrighted access if the calling contract is controlled by an attacker.

Additionally, the contract uses the `Constructor` function with the `public` visibility, which means it can be called by anyone. This could potentially allow an attacker to create multiple instances of the contract and claim ownership, leading to a reentrancy attack.

Lastly, the contract uses the `SafeERC20` and `SafeMath` libraries, which are not vulnerable by themselves, but it's essential to ensure that the libraries are up-to-date and free of vulnerabilities.",981,218,9.052237033843994

This function allows any user to transfer their balance to themselves, effectively draining the contract's funds. The `msg.sender` can be any user, not just the creator or an authorized user. This is a critical vulnerability as it allows any user to drain the contract's funds without any restrictions.

To fix this vulnerability, the `refund` function should be restricted to the contract creator or an authorized user.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `tx.origin` for access control in line 42: `require(tx.origin == owner);`. This approach is deprecated and can be bypassed by a malicious actor through a simple contract forwarding mechanism. An attacker can create a contract that forwards transactions to the `Phishable` contract, making it appear as if the transactions are originating from the attacker's contract, not the attacker's address. This allows the attacker to bypass the `require` check and call the `withdrawAll` function, leading to unautrighted access to the contract's funds.",957,147,6.162058353424072
26,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in both the `withdraw` and fallback functions. The `delegatecall` function allows the contract to execute code in the context of another contract, which can lead to access control issues if not properly managed.

In the `withdraw` function, the `delegatecall` is used to call the `setFibonacci` function in the `fibonacciLibrary` contract. This could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the `fibonacciLibrary` contract if they can control the input to the `delegatecall`.

Similarly, in the fallback function, the `delegatecall` is used to call the `msg.data` function in the `fibonacciLibrary` contract. This could also allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the `fibonacciLibrary` contract if they can control the input to the `delegatecall`.

To fix this vulnerability, you should avoid using `delegatecall` in the fallback function and instead use a more secure method to access the functionality of the `fibonacciLibrary` contract. Additionally, you should ensure that the `fibonacciLibrary` contract has proper access control mechanisms in place to prevent unauthorized access to its functions.",1567,291,12.161260843276978

The vulnerability lies in line 63:

```solidity

This line allows the `msg.sender` to make a new call to the `Collect` function before the initial execution is complete. If the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract, it can exploit this by implementing a fallback function that calls back into the `Collect` function, potentially draining funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which means that you should first perform all checks and effects (updates to the state) before interacting with other contracts. In this case, you should deduct the `_am` amount from the `acc.balance` before making the external call.

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the function `WithdrawToHolder` in the `TokenBank` contract. The line `if(_addr.call.value(_wei)())` allows for a reentrancy attack because it sends Ether to the `_addr` address and then proceeds to update the `Holders[_addr]` mapping without any checks in between.

An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the `WithdrawToHolder` function and then calls back into the `WithdrawToHolder` function before the Ether transfer is completed. This can lead to multiple withdrawals and potentially draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the Ether transfer should be done before updating the `Holders[_addr]` mapping, and the contract should use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks.",1818,204,8.676322937011719

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles dynamic array resizing in the `insertNnumbers` function. The vulnerability lies in the lines where the contract attempts to resize the `array` if `numElements` exceeds its current length.

The issue is with the line:

```solidity
array.length += 1;

In Solidity, arrays are fixed-size, and the `length` property cannot be directly modified. The correct way to resize an array is to use the `push` method, which internally handles the resizing. The line above does not resize the array and will not add any new elements to it.

This vulnerability can be exploited by repeatedly calling the `insertNnumbers` function with a large number of elements, causing the contract to attempt to resize the array without actually adding any new elements. This can lead to a Denial of Service attack by consuming gas and potentially causing the contract to run out of gas, making it unresponsive.

To fix this vulnerability, the `insertNnumbers` function should be updated to use the `push` method to add elements to the array:

```solidity

Additionally, the contract allows the government to send funds to the corruptElite address, which could be exploited by an attacker to drain the contract's funds. The contract also does not have any access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive functions, which could lead to further vulnerabilities.",2749,163,7.467689752578735
136,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the same reason as the first contract: the `refundAll` function iterates over the `refundAddresses` array and attempts to send Ether to each address using the `send` method. If any of the addresses fail to accept the transaction (e.g., due to insuperfice balance, contract not being deployed, or other reasons), the transaction will fail, and the `refundAll` function will not proceed to the next address. This can cause the function to hang indefinitely if it encounters a failing transaction, effectively denying service to the rest of the addresses in the array.",1225,149,6.364008188247681
137,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function, specifically in lines 24 and 25:

```solidity
for(uint i=0;i<350;i++) {
    listAddresses.push(msg.sender);
}
```

This function allows any user to push up to 350 addresses into the `listAddresses` array. If an attacker repeatedly calls this function, they can fill the array with their addresses, potentially causing the array to reach its maximum size limit. When the array is full, the function will reset it to an empty array, which could lead to a DoS attack by repeatedly filling and emptying the array.

In a DoS attack, the attacker can prevent legitimate users from accessing the contract's functionality by consuming the contract's resources, such as gas and storage. In this case, the attacker can fill the `listAddresses` array with their addresses, causing the contract to continuously reset the array and consume gas. This can lead to a denial of service for other users trying to interact with the contract.",1043,265,10.947411298751831
138,denial of service," YES

The smart contract code provided is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the same issue as the first contract: the require statement that sends the currentBid to the currentFrontrunner. If the currentFrontrunner's address is a contract that does not handle the Ether sent to it properly, or if it's a contract that is designed to fail or is not always online, it could cause the function to fail and prevent further bids from being processed. This could effectively take the auction offline.",1033,121,5.142658710479736
