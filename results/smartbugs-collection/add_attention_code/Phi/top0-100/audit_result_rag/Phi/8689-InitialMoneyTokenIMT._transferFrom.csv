The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. Although it is not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, the vulnerability is commonly associated with the `MultiOwnable` contract, which is used in the `TestContract`. The `MultiOwnable` contract uses the `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict access to certain functions, but if it relies on `tx.origin` for access control, it would be vulnerable.

The `tx.origin` is the original Ethereum account that initiated the transaction, and it can be easily spoofed by an attacker. An attacker can create a transaction from a different account, but with the `tx.origin` set to the attacker's account, thus bypassing the access control checks.

To fix this vulnerability, the `MultiOwnable` contract should use a more secure method for access control, such as using a mapping to store the owners and checking the mapping in the `onlyOwner` modifier.",1180,230,9.54702615737915

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the `require` statement in the `withdraw` function. The line `require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);` can be exploited by an attacker who has a balance of 0. The attacker can call the `withdraw` function with an amount of 0, which will pass the `require` check and allow the attacker to withdraw 0 ETH. This can be used to drain the contract's funds if the contract has a balance and the `creator` address is not the only one with a non-zero balance.

Additionally, the `migrateTo` function is vulnerable because it allows the `creator` to transfer the entire balance of the contract to any address. This can be exploited by an attacker who gains control of the `creator` address, either through front-running or other means.

The `InitialMoneyTokenIMT` contract is not vulnerable to the same access control issue as the `Wallet` contract, but it has other potential vulnerabilities not related to access control.",1043,245,10.154571294784546

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. Although it is not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, the mention of `tx.origin` in the explanation suggests that the contract might be using it for access control checks. The `tx.origin` is a global variable in Solidity that represents the original transaction sender, which can be problematic because it can be spoofed by a malicious contract that calls the vulnerable contract. This can lead to unautrighted access to the contract's functions.

Additionally, the contract uses the `pragma solidity ^0.4.24;` version, which is outdated and no longer supported. This version of Solidity has known security issues and should not be used for new contracts.

Lastly, the contract uses the `function () payable {}` fallback function, which is not recommended as it can be exploited by attackers to send Ether to the contract without any specific function being called.",858,224,9.26158881187439

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. The `onlyowner` modifier checks if the `msg.sender` is equal to the `owner`, which is fine for simple access control. However, the issue arises with the fallback function:

```solidity

```

This fallback function can be called by anyone, allowing them to send Ether to the contract without any restrictions. This means that the contract's balance can be increased without the owner's permission, and the `withdraw` function can be called by anyone who has sent Ether to the contract, potentially leading to unauthorized withdrawals.

The issue is that the `allowed[_from][_who]` mapping does not properly restrict who can transfer funds from an account. Any user can call the `_transferFrom` function and transfer funds from another user's account as long as they have enough balance and the allowance. This is a form of access control bypass.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should include a check to ensure that the caller of the `_transferFrom` function is the owner of the `allow` mapping for the `_from` address. This can be done by adding a modifier that checks if the caller is the owner of the `allow` mapping and applying it to the `_transferFrom` function.",735,184,7.604089021682739

In the provided code, the Command function allows the owner to execute arbitrary code on another contract by passing the address and data. The vulnerability lies in the line:

adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);

If the called contract reverts, the current execution will continue without checking the return value of the call, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploitation.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should be updated to use the low-level call() function with proper error checking, or better yet, use the newer and safer low-level call{}() function introduced in Solidity 0.6.0.",2065,191,8.502308368682861

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to unchecked low-level calls. The vulnerability lies in the `_transferFrom` function, specifically in the line where the `add` and `sub` functions from the `SafeMath` library are used. Although the `SafeMath` library is used to prevent overflow and underflow, the vulnerability is not in the arithmetic operations themselves but in the fact that the `_transferFrom` function is marked as `internal` and not `public`.

In Solidity, `internal` functions can only be called by the contract itself or by derived contracts. This means that the `_transferFrom` function cannot be called externally, and thus, it is not exposed to potential attackers. However, if the contract is later extended or inherited by another contract, the `internal` function could be called by the derived contract, potentially leading to vulnerabilities if the derived contract is not properly audited.

In conclusion, the vulnerability in the given smart contract code is not due to unchecked low-level calls, but rather the use of an `internal` function that could be exposed to potential attackers through inheritance. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to use `public` functions for critical operations and ensure that the contract and its derived contracts are properly audited for security vulnerabilities.",909,287,11.858499765396118

This line uses the low-level `call.value` function to send `_value` worth of Ether to the `_target` address. As mentioned in the explanation, low-level functions like `call`, `callcode`, `delegatecall`, and `send` do not propagate errors and will not revert the current execution if they fail. Instead, they return a boolean value set to false, and the code will continue to run.

In this case, if the `call.right` fails (e.g., due to insufficient gas, or the recipient address being invalid), the function will not revert, and the contract will continue executing. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the `transfer` or `send` function instead of the low-level `call.value` function. These functions will revert the transaction if the transfer fails, ensuring that the contract execution is aborted in case of an error.

The provided smart contract code for the InitialMoneyTokenIMT is not vulnerable to front running in the context of the FindThisHash contract. The front running vulnerability in the FindThisHash contract is due to the public and visible nature of pending transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, which allows malicious actors to copy and prioritize transactions with higher fees.

However, the InitialMoneyTokenIMT contract is a token contract that handles transfers and balances of a token. It does not expose any sensitive information that could be exploited for front running in the same way as the FindThisHtml contract. The vulnerability in the FindThisHash contract is specific to the way it handles the solution to a puzzle and the reward mechanism.

In the InitialMoneyTokenIMT contract, the transfer of tokens is handled internally and does not involve any external puzzle-solving or reward mechanisms that could be susceptible to front running. The contract uses SafeMath library to perform safe arithmetic operations, which helps prevent overflow and underflow issues but does not directly relate to front running vulnerabilities.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the contract allows for the approval of a specific amount of tokens to be spent by a spender. If a user approves a certain amount of tokens for a spender, and then the spender immediately calls the `transferFrom` function, the contract will execute the transfer. However, if a malicious user sees this transaction in the mempool (the pool of unconfirmed transactions), they can create a new transaction with a higher gas price to be mined first. This new transaction can then call the `transferFrom` function before the original transaction is mined, effectively stealing the tokens that were meant for the original spender.

In the provided code, the vulnerability is not directly related to the SafeMath library or the `approve` function itself, but rather to the timing and order of transactions being mined. The SafeMath library is used to prevent overflow and underflow issues, which is a good practice, but it does not address the front-running vulnerability.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract could implement a delay mechanism or a nonce system to ensure that once a user approves a certain amount of tokens for a spender, the spender must wait for a specific time or use a specific nonce before executing the transfer.

87,arithmetic," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. Although the SafeMath library is used to prevent direct overflows and underflows in arithmetic operations, the vulnerability still exists in the `_transferFrom` function.

The issue lies in the following lines:

```solidity
balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(_value);
balances[_from] = balances[_from].sub(_value);
```

The `add` and `sub` functions from the SafeEE library are used to prevent overflows and underflows. However, the `allowed[_from][_who]` mapping is not updated using the SafeMath library, which can lead to an integer underflow when `_value` is greater than `allowed[_from][_who]`.

To fix this vulnerability, the `allowed[_from][_who]` mapping should also be updated using the SafeMath library, like this:

```solidity
allowed[_from][_who] = allowed[_from][_who].sub(_value);
```

By using the SafeMath library for all arithmetic operations, the smart contract will be protected against integer overflows and underflows.",952,266,10.965872526168823

The `add` function from the `SafeMath` library is used, which should prevent integer overflow and underflow. However, the `sub` function is also used in the same function, which is not protected by the `SafeMath` library. This can lead to integer underflow if the `allowed[_from][_who]` value is less than `_value`.

To fix this vulnerability, you should also use the `sub` function from the `SafeMath` library for the `allowed[_from][_who]` subtraction:

```solidity
allowed[_from][_who] = allowed[_from][_who].sub(_value);

```

Although the `SafeMath` library is used for the `add` and `sub` functions, the `balances[_to]` and `balances[_from]` variables are not explicitly declared as `uint256` with the `SafeMath` library. This means that the `SafeMath` library's overflow checks are not applied to these variables.

To fix this vulnerability, you should explicitly declare the `balances` mapping as `uint25EEEE64x16` and use the `SafeMath` library for all arithmetic operations involving `balances`. Here's an updated version of the contract:

This line allows the `msg.sender` to potentially call the `Collect` function again before the balance is deducted, leading to a reentrancy attack. An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the `Collect` function and then calls the `Put` function, effectively draining the funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the state (in this case, the balance) before making any external calls. Here's an updated version of the `Collect` function:

This line allows the `msg.sender` to make a recursive call to the `withdraw` function before the state of the contract is updated (i.e., before the balance is deducted). This can lead to multiple withdrawals being executed in a single transaction, potentially draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the state (i.e., deduct the balance) before making the external call. Here's an example of how the `withdraw` function can be modified to prevent the reentrancy attack:

```solidity

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function, specifically in the line where the contract sends Ether to the `msg.sender` before updating the credit balance:

```solidity
bool res = msg.sender.call.value(amount)();
credit[msg.sender]-=amount;

In this code, the contract sends Ether to the `msg.sender` and then updates the credit balance. If the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract with a fallback function designed to call the `withdraw` function again, it can drain the contract's funds before the balance is updated. This is because the state of the contract is not updated until the end of the transaction, and the malicious contract can exploit this by calling the `withdraw` function recursively.

To fix this vulnerability, you can follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests updating the state (effects) before sending Ether (interactions). Here's an updated version of the `withdraw` function:

119,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 52:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

In this line, the contract is sending Ether to the `msg.sender` and then immediately updating the balance of the sender. If the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract with a fallback function that calls back into the `CashOut` function, it can potentially withdraw more Ether than it should, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, you can follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests that you should first perform all necessary checks and effects (updates to the state) before interacting with external contracts. In this case, you should update the balance of the sender before sending Ether to them.

Here's an updated version of the `CashOut` function that follows the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern:

```solidity
function CashOut(uint _am)
{
    if(_am <= balances[msg.sender])
    {
        balances[msg.sender] -= _am;
        TransferLog.AddMessage(msg.sender, _am, ""CashOut"");

120,reentrancy," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in line 38 of the CashOut function:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. In this case, the contract is calling the CashOut function, which deducts the specified amount from the sender's balance and logs the transaction. If the external contract is malicious and has a fallback function that calls back into the CashOut function, it can potentially withdraw funds multiple times before the balance is updated, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests that you should first perform all checks and effects (updates to the contract's state) before interacting with external contracts. In the case of the CashOut function, you should first deduct the specified amount from the sender'sin balance and then call the external contract.

Here's an updated version of the CashOut function that is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks:

function CashOut(uint _am)
{
    if(_am<=balances[msg.sender])

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (the `msg.sender`) and sending Ether to it before updating the `balances` mapping. If the external contract is malicious and has a fallback function that calls back into the `Collect` function of the `PRIVATE_ETH_CELL` contract, it can potentially withdraw more Ether than it should, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, you should update the `balances` mapping before calling the external contract. Here's an updated version of the `Collect` function:

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in line 40, where the contract allows an external call to be made before the state changes are finalized:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the `msg.sender` to potentially call the `CashOut` function again before the balance is updated, leading to a reentrancy attack. An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the `CashOut` function and then calls it again in a recursive manner, draining funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance before making the external call, or use a pattern like Checks-Effects-Interactions to prevent reentrancy attacks.",1449,176,7.472552537918091

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the PrivateBank contract before the initial execution is complete. If the external contract is malicious and has a fallback function designed to drain funds, it can repeatedly call the CashOut function, causing the PrivateBank contract to deduct the balance multiple times before the balance is actually reduced.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance first and then perform the external call, or use a pattern like Checks-Effects-Interactions to avoid reentrancy issues.",1433,169,7.165537595748901

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (the `msg.sender`) and sending Ether to it before updating the balance of the sender. This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `Collect` function before the balance update is completed, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the balance update should be done before the external call, and the contract should use the `transfer` or `send` functions to send Ether to the external contract, which do not allow for reentrancy.",1625,171,7.290753126144409
126,reentrancy," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The vulnerability lies in the `_transferFrom` function, specifically in the lines where the balances are updated before the state changes are finalized. The function updates the `balances[_to]` and `balances[_from]` before the `emit Transfer` statement, which can lead to a reentrancy attack if the `_transferFrom` function is called by an external contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the state changes should be finalized before the external call is made. Here's an example of how the function can be modified to prevent reentrancy attacks:

```solidity
function _transferFrom(address _who, address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) internal returns (bool success) {
    
    uint256 allow = allowed[_from][_who];

127,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `isSaleFinished` function of the `TimedCrowdsale` contract, which relies on the `block.timestamp` to determine if the sale is finished.

128,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation due to its reliance on block.timestamp for both the payOut function and the randomGen function.

129,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the resetInvestment function, specifically in the line:

if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp+ONE_MINUTE) throw;

This line checks if the current block timestamp is less than the last investment timestamp plus one minute. An attacker can exploit this by manipulating the block timestamp to be within the allowed time frame, allowing them to call the resetInvestment function and reset the jackpot and lastInvestor.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a more reliable source of time, such as block.number or a trusted oracle, to determine the time elapsed since the last investment.",1317,161,6.828169345855713
130,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same lines as the original code you provided:

The vulnerability lies in line 18: `require(now!= pastBlockTime);` // only 1 transaction per block

The vulnerability lies in line 20: `pastBlockTime = now;`

In this contract, the `pastBlockTime` variable is used to ensure that only one transaction per block can execute the `if(now % 15 == 0)` condition. However, miners have the ability to manipulate the timestamp of a block within a certain range (currently up to 15 seconds). This means that a miner could potentially manipulate the block timestamp to make the `now % 15 == 0` condition true, allowing the contract to execute the `msg.sender.transfer(this.balance)` line and transfer the contract's balance to the sender.

This vulnerability can be exploited by a miner with a significant amount of hash power, as they can control the block timestamp and potentially drain the contract's funds. To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a more reliable source of time or to implement a time lock mechanism that does not rely solely on the block timestamp.",889,283,11.6644287109375
131,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same line as the first contract:

var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;

This line uses block.timestamp to generate a random number, which can be manipulated by miners. An attacker with enough hash power could influence the block timestamps to control the outcome of the random number generation, potentially winning the lottery multiple times or avoiding paying fees.",1103,109,4.664153814315796
132,short addresses," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of the `address` type for the `to` parameter in the `sendCoin` function. The `address` type in Solidity is 20 bytes, but it can be padded with leading zeros, which can lead to short address attacks. An attacker can exploit this by using a short address that is not recognized by some clients, causing transactions to fail or be sent to the wrong recipient.

To fix this issue, the `to` parameter should be changed to the `address payable` type, which is explicitly 20 bytes and cannot be padded with leading zeros. This change will prevent short address attacks and make the smart contract more secure.

Here's the updated `sendCoin` function:

```solidity
function sendCoin(address payable to, uint amount) returns(bool sufficient) {
    if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) return false;
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    to.transfer(amount);
    Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
    return true;
}
```

Note that I also replaced the `balances[to] += amount;` line with `to.transfer(amount);` to ensure that the transfer is atomic and cannot be reversed.",1096,300,12.41561770439148
133,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. An attacker can repeatedly call the `addCreditors` function to fill the `creditorAddresses` array with their own address. Once the array reaches a length of 1500, the `emptyCreditors` function will be triggered, which clears the entire array and sets the `win` variable to true. This can be exploited to disrupt the contract's intended functionality by repeatedly adding and removing creditors, effectively causing a DoS condition.",1061,130,5.518243789672852
134,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles the dynamic resizing of the `array` when inserting elements. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the contract checks if `numElements` is equal to `array.length` and then increments `array.length` by 1.

The issue is that Solidity arrays are dynamic, and their length can be changed at runtime. However, the line `array.length += 1;` is not the correct way to resize the array. Instead, it should use the `push` method to add elements to the array. The current implementation can lead to an out-of-gas error when trying to access an index that doesn't exist, causing the transaction to fail and potentially leading to a DoS attack if the attacker repeatedly calls the `insertNnumbers` function with a large `numbers` value.

To fix this vulnerability, the `insertNnumbers` function should be updated to use the `push` method to add elements to the array, like this:

```solidity
function insertNnumbers(uint value, uint numbers) public {
    for(uint i=0; i<numbers; i++) {
        array.push(value);
    }
}
```

135,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the reset of the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays in line 46 and line 48, respectively. This reset occurs every time a new credit cycle starts, which is defined by the condition `lastTimeOfNewCredit + TWELVE_HOURS < block.timestamp`. When this condition is met, the arrays are reinitialized to empty arrays, effectively erasing all previous data.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who can repeatedly call the `lendGovernmentMoney` function within the time window of 12 hours, causing the arrays to be reset multiple times. This would result in the loss of all stored creditor addresses and amounts, making it impossible for the contract to function correctly and potentially causing a denial of service.

To fix this vulnerability, the reset of the arrays should be removed or handled in a more controlled manner, ensuring that the contract can continue to function correctly even after multiple credit cycles.",2612,237,10.549964427947998
136,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[EE]]);
```

The issue here is that the `send` function is a low-level function that can fail for various reasons, such as the recipient address not having enough gas, or the recipient contract reverting the transaction. If any of the `send` calls fail, the entire `refundAll` function will fail and return a revert, effectively blocking the refund process for all addresses in the `refundAddresses` array.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has control over one of the addresses in the `refundAddresses` array. The attacker can simply send a transaction to their address, causing the `send` function to fail and blocking the refund process for all addresses in the array.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the `transfer` function instead of the `send` function, as it is a higher-level function that will not revert the transaction if the recipient contract does. Here's an updated version of the `refundAll` function:

```solidity
function refundAll() public",1088,301,12.348896741867065
137,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the potential for gas limit issues. The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function, which could be exploited by repeatedly calling it to fill the `listAddresses` array with a large number of addresses. This could consume a significant amount of gas, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors for other transactions on the network.

Additionally, the `InitialMoneyTokenIMT` contract uses the SafeMath library, which is a good practice to prevent overflow and underflow issues. However, the `_transferFrom` function could be vulnerable to a reentrancy attack if the `allowed` mapping is not updated atomically with the balance updates. This could lead to funds being transferred multiple times during a single transaction, potentially draining the contract's funds.
rights to call the `_transferFrom` function.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, consider the following improvements:

1. Implement a gas limit for the `ifillArray` function to prevent excessive gas consumption.
2. Update the `allowed` mapping atomically with the balance updates in the `_transferFrom` function to prevent reentrancy attacks.

By addressing these issues, the smart contract will be more resilient against Denial of Service attacks and other potential vulnerabilities.",906,301,12.341553211212158

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the use of the `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid))` statement. This line of code attempts to send the current bid amount to the current frontrunner. If the current frontrunner's address is a contract that does not have a fallback function to handle incoming ether, the transaction will fail, causing the `require` statement to revert the entire transaction. This can be exploited by an attacker to prevent legitimate bids from being processed, effectively causing a denial of service.",896,135,5.655909061431885
