The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. Although it is not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, the `MultiOwnable` contract is commonly used in conjunction with other contracts that may rely on `tx.origin` for access control. This can lead to vulnerabilities if the `MultiOwnable` contract is used in a proxy pattern where `tx.origin` is not the actual caller of the contract functions.

In the `MultiOwnable` contract, the `onlyOwner` modifier is used to restrict access to certain functions. However, if the `MultiOwnable` contract is used in a proxy pattern with `delegatecall`, the `tx.origin` will not be the actual caller, and the `onlyOwner` modifier will not work as intended. This can lead to unautrighted access to the contract's functionality.

To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a more secure access control mechanism, such as using a whitelist of authorized addresses or using a more secure modifier that checks the actual caller of the contract functions.",1121,249,10.315586566925049
12,access control," YES

The smart contract code provided is vulnerable due to the use of `msg.sender` in the `LUXREUM()` function on line 18. This function assigns the total supply of tokens to the address that deploys the contract, which is not the intended behavior for a token contract. The `missing()` function on line 24 sets the `owner` to the address that deploys the contract, which means that the deployer of the contract will have the `owner` role. This is a significant access control issue because it allows the deployer to withdraw all tokens from the contract without any further authorization checks.

Additionally, the `approveAndCall` function on line 27 allows any address to approve another address to spend tokens on behalf of the calling address. This function does not check if the calling address is the owner or has any other authorization, which could lead to unautrightful spending of tokens.

Lastly, the `withdraw` function on line 34 is correctly protected by the `onlyowner` modifier, but due to the issues mentioned above, the deployer of the contract can still withdraw all tokens without any authorization checks.",782,256,10.588470697402954

16,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `set` function, specifically in the line `map[key] = value;`. This function allows anyone to modify the `map` array, which could lead to unautrightful changes in the contract's state.

In the `set` function, there is no access control mechanism to restrict who can modify the `map` array. This means that any user can call the `set` function and change the values in the `map` array, potentially leading to unauthorized changes in the contract's state.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add an access control mechanism to the `set` function, such as requiring the caller to be the owner of the contract or to have a specific role. This can be done by adding a modifier to the `set` function that checks the caller's permissions before allowing them to modify the `map` array.

Here's an example of how you can add an access control mechanism to the `set` function:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Map {
    address public owner;
    uint256[] map;

    modifier onlyOwner() {

The vulnerability lies in the use of delegatecall in the forward function. Delegatecall allows a contract to execute code in the context of another contract, which can lead to access control issues if not used carefully.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `approveAndCall` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
require(_spender.call(bytes4(bytes32(sha3(""receiveApproval(address,uint256,address,bytes)""))), msg.sender, _value, this, _extraData));
```

This line uses the `call` method to send a message to the `_spender` address, which could be a malicious contract. The `call` method is used to execute code on the `_spender` contract, and if the `_spender` contract has a fallback function or a function that can be called with the provided arguments, it can execute arbitrary code.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who controls the `_spender` contract. The attacker can create a malicious contract with a fallback function that can drain the funds from the `Wallet` contract or perform other malicious actions.

To fix this vulnerability, the `approveAndCall` function should be removed or replaced with a safer alternative, such as using the `transfer` or `send` methods to transfer funds between contracts, which do not execute arbitrary code on the target contract.",1043,289,11.95937705039978

106,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 55:

```solidity

In this line, the contract is sending Ether to the `msg.sender` and then calling a function on the `msg.sender` contract. If the `msg.sender` contract is malicious and has a fallback function that calls back into the `Collect` function of the current contract, it can potentially withdraw more Ether than intended, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance before sending Ether to the `msg.sender` contract. This can be done by changing the order of operations in the `Collect` function:

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the `TokenBank` contract before the execution of the `WithdrawToHolder` function is complete. If the external contract is malicious and has a fallback function designed to re-enter the `TokenBank` contract, it can repeatedly call the `WithdrawToHolder` function, draining the funds from the `Holders` mapping.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the `Holders` mapping before making the external call, and use a low-level call with proper checks to ensure the call is successful.",1622,197,8.354943990707397
109,reentrancy," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `airDrop()` function in the `ModifierEntrancy` contract. The function modifier `supportsToken()` is used to check if the token is supported, and the function modifier `hasNoBalance` is used to ensure that the sender has no balance of the token. However, the `airDrop()` function directly modifies the `tokenBalance` mapping without any checks or protections against reentrancy.

In the `attack` contract, the `call()` function calls `ModifierEntrancy(token).airDrop()` without any checks or protections against reentrancy. This means that an attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the `supportsToken()` function and then calls the `airDrop()` function, causing the `tokenBalance` mapping to be modified multiple times before the initial execution is complete. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `airDrop()` function should be modified to use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, where all checks and effects are performed before any external interactions. Additionally, the `call()` function in the `attack` contract should be modified to use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern as well.",1232,293,12.16492772102356

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete, which can lead to the reentrancy attack. In this case, the CashOut function is vulnerable because it allows the external contract to withdraw funds before updating the balances mapping.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests that you should first perform all checks and effects (updates to the state) before interacting with external contracts. Here's an updated version of the CashOut function:

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. This function checks if the length of `creditorAddresses` is greater than 1500, and if so, it resets the array to an empty array, effectively removing all stored addresses.

134,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles dynamic array resizing in the `insertNnumbers` function. The vulnerability lies in the lines where the array is resized and elements are added:

- Line 20: `array.length += 1;`
- Line 21: `}`
- Line 22: `array[numElements++] = value;`

The issue is that the contract does not have a mechanism to limit the rate at which the array is resized and elements are added. An attacker can call the `insertNnumbers` function repeatedly with a large number of elements, causing the contract to continuously resize the array and consume all available gas. This can lead to a denial of service as the contract may run out of gas or become unresponsive due to the excessive computation required.

If an attacker repeatedly calls this function, they can fill the array with their own address, causing the function to return `false` and effectively preventing other users from adding addresses to the array. This can lead to a denial of service, as the array will not be able to accept new addresses once it reaches the limit of 1500 addresses.

Additionally, the contract does not have any access control or rate limiting mechanisms in place to prevent an attacker from repeatedly calling the `ifillArray` function. This makes it even more susceptible to denial of service attacks.",847,232,9.605918407440186
