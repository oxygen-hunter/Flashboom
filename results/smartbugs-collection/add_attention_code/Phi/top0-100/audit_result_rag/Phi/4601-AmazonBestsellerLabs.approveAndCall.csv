```solidity
if(!_spender.call(bytes4(bytes3EE(sha3(""receiveApproval(address,uint256,address,bytes)""))), msg.sender, _value, this, _extraData)) { throw; }
```

This line is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The `call` function is used to send Ether to `_spender`, and it also allows `_spender` to execute arbitrary code before the execution returns to the calling function. If `_spender` is malicious and has a fallback function that calls back into the `approveAndCall` function, it can potentially withdraw funds multiple times before the initial transaction is completed.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests that you should first perform all checks and effects (state changes) before interacting with external contracts. In this case, you should update the `allowed` mapping and emit the `Approval` event before making the `call` to `_spender`. Here's an updated version of the `approveAndCall` function:

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` to validate callers. This can be seen in the `approveAndEE` function, where the contract is calling another contract's function using `call` or `delegatecall`.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `addPayout` function, where the `Participant` struct is pushed to the `participants` array without any access control checks. This means that any user can call the `addPayout` function and add themselves to the `participants` array, potentially leading to unauthorized payouts.

To fix this vulnerability, the `addPayout` function should be modified to include access control checks, ensuring that only the creator or an authorized user can add participants to the `participants` array.",3325,139,6.709771633148193
14,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `approveAndCall` function, which allows an attacker to bypass the access control checks and execute arbitrary code.

The `approveAndCall` function allows an address to approve another address to spend a certain amount of tokens on their behalf. However, the function does not check if the `_spender` address is authorized to perform this action. This means that an attacker can call this function with their own address as the `_spender` and approve themselves to spend tokens from the contract.

Once the attacker has approved themselves, they can then call the `approveAndCall` function again with their own address as the `_spender` and `_value`, and pass in any arbitrary `_extraData` bytes. This will cause the contract to execute the attacker's code, which can lead to various attacks such as stealing funds or manipulating the contract's state.

To fix this vulnerability, the `approveAndCall` function should include access control checks to ensure that only authorized addresses can call it. Additionally, the contract should use the `msg.sender` or `owner` address to perform sensitive operations instead of relying on external inputs.",866,274,11.4798264503479

This line is vulnerable because it does not use the `onlyowner` modifier to restrict access to the `approveAndCall` function. As a result, any user can call this function and potentially cause unintended behavior or exploit the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add the `onlyowner` modifier to the `approveAndCall` function, like this:

```solidity

This line is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The `call` method is used to send Ether to another contract, and it also allows the recipient contract to execute arbitrary code before the execution returns to the calling contract.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `migrateTo` function, which allows the `creator` to transfer the contract's balance to any address. Since the `creator` is set in the `initWallet` function and is not protected, any user who calls `initWallet` can set themselves as the `creator`. This allows them to bypass the `require(creator == msg.sender);` check in the `migrateEE` function and transfer the contract's balance to any address they choose.

To fix this vulnerability, the `creator` should be set in the constructor of the contract and not be accessible or modifiable by any other function. Additionally, the `migrateTo` function should be restricted to only the `creator` or an authorized address.",893,187,7.871631860733032

This line uses the deprecated `call` function with `tx.origin` as the sender, which can be exploited by an attacker. The `call` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, where an attacker can call the function recursively, potentially draining funds from the contract.

In this case, the attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the `approveAndCall` function, and then reenters the function multiple times before the initial call is finished. This can lead to multiple unauthorized transfers of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the `transfer` or `send` function instead of `call` for sending Ether, and use the `delegatecall` function with proper checks for calling external contracts. Additionally, you should avoid using `tx.origin` for access control and instead use the `msg.sender` variable.",611,287,11.934004545211792

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `refund` function, which is similar to the `withdraw` function in the original code you provided. The line `msg.sender.right(balances[msg.sender]);` allows any caller to withdraw all their funds, which is a significant access control issue. This is because the `msg.sender` can be any external account, not just the owner of the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add an access control mechanism to restrict the `refund` function to only the owner of the contract. This can be done by adding a modifier that checks if the caller is the owner and applying it to the `refund` function. Here's an example of how to fix the vulnerability:

This line uses the `call` method to send a message to the `_spender` address. The `call` method is a low-level function that can be used to interact with other contracts. However, it is also a potential source of vulnerabilities, as it can be exploited by attackers to bypass access control checks.

In this case, the vulnerability is related to the use of the `call` method in combination with the `tx.origin` check in the `withdrawAll` function. An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the `approveAndEE` function with the `_spender` address set to the address of the `Phishable` contract. This will cause the `Phishable` contract to call its own `withdrawAll` function, bypassing the `tx.origin == owner` check and allowing the attacker to withdraw all funds from the contract.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in both the `withdraw` and fallback functions. The `delegatecall` is used to execute a function in the context of another contract, which can lead to access control issues if not properly managed. In this case, the `delegatecall` is used to call functions in the `fibonacciLibrary` contract, which could potentially be controlled by an attacker.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `fibonacciLibrary` contract is not explicitly defined in the code, and it is assumed to be a separate contract that is deployed and passed as an address to the `FibonEE` constructor. If an attacker can deploy a malicious contract with the same function signature as the `setFibonacci` function in the `fibonacciLibrary` contract, they could potentially manipulate the `calculatedFibNumber` value, leading to incorrect withdrawals.

Additionally, the use of `delegatecall` in the fallback function (line 38) is also a potential vulnerability. The fallback function is called when the contract receives ether without any data or when it receives data that doesn't match any of its functions.

This line uses the low-level `call()` function to send a message to `_spender`. If the call fails, it throws an exception, but the failure is not properly handled. The `call()` function returns a boolean value indicating success or failure, and it is crucial to check this return value to ensure the call was successful.

In this case, the `if` statement checks if the call failed, but if it did, the contract throws an exception without reverting the state changes made before the failed call. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities, such as the loss of funds or incorrect state updates.

3. Line 33: `msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`

In Solidity version 0.4.21, the `*` operator does not check for overflow or underflow. This means that if the result of the multiplication exceeds the maximum value of a uint256, it will wrap around to zero, leading to incorrect calculations and potentially allowing attackers to manipulate the contract's behavior.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflow and underflow. You can import the library and use its functions for multiplication and addition.

This line allows the `msg.sender` to make a call to an external contract before the execution of the `Collect` function is complete. If the external contract being called is malicious and has a fallback function that calls back into the `Collect` function, it can potentially withdraw funds multiple times before the balance is updated, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, you should follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern, where you first perform all necessary checks and updates to the state, and then interact with external contracts. In this case, you should deduct the `_am` amount from the `balances[msg.sender]` before making the external call. Here's an updated version of the `Collect` function:

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. In this case, the Collect function is vulnerable to reentrancy because it allows the external contract to call the Put function before the balance is updated.

An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the Collect function and then calls the Put function, effectively stealing funds from the contract. The malicious contract can keep calling the Put function until the balance is depleted, and then proceed to withdraw the funds.

The vulnerability lies in line 54:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (the `msg.sender`) and sending Ether to it before updating the balance of the sender. This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `Collect` function before the balance update is completed, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance of the sender before calling the external contract. Here's an updated version of the `Collect` function:

126,reentrancy," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `approveAndCall` function. When the `_spender.call` line is executed, it allows the external contract to make a new call to the `withdrawBalance` function before the initial execution is complete. This can lead to the reentrancy attack, where the external contract can call `withdrawBalance` multiple times before the state of the contract is updated, potentially draining funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests that you should first perform all checks and effects (updates to the contract's state) before interacting with external contracts. In this case, you should update the `userBalances` mapping before making the external call in the `approveAndCall` function.

Here's an updated version of the `approveAndCall` function that mitigates the reentrancy vulnerability:

```solidity
function approveAndCall(address _spender, uint256 _value, bytes _extraData) returns (bool success) {
    allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
    Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);

127,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `isSaleFinished` function, which checks if the sale is finished based on the current block timestamp.

128,time manipulation," YES

The smart contract code provided is vulnerable to time manipulation due to its reliance on block.timestamp for both the payOut function and the randomGen function. This can be exploited by miners who have control over the timestamp of the block they mine.",860,57,2.5457205772399902
129,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `resetInvestment` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp+ONE_MINUTE)
```

This line checks if the current block timestamp is less than the `lastInvestmentTimestamp` plus one minute. An attacker can exploit this by manipulating the block timestamp to be within the allowed time frame, allowing them to call the `resetInvestment` function and reset the jackpot.

The `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners, as mentioned in the provided explanation. This manipulation can be used by an attacker to call the `resetInvestment` function within the allowed time frame, even if the actual time has not passed.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a more reliable method to track the time, such as using a block number or an external time oracle service.",1140,218,9.241132020950317
130,time manipulation," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same lines as the original code you provided:

- Line 18: `require(now!= pastBlockTime);`
- Line 20: `pastBlockTime = now;`

These lines are used to ensure that only one transaction per block can transfer the balance to the sender. However, miners have the ability to manipulate the timestamp of a block within a certain range (currently up to 15 minutes). This means that a miner could potentially delay the execution of the contract's code by mining a block with a timestamp that is not significantly different from the previous block's timestamp.

As a result, the contract's logic that relies on the current time (now) can be manipulated, leading to potential exploits. In this case, the vulnerability could allow a miner to delay the transfer of funds to the sender, potentially causing financial losses or other unintended consequences.",712,217,9.092357635498047
131,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same line as the first contract:

var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;

This line uses block.timestamp to generate a random number, which can be manipulated by miners. An attacker with enough hash power could influence the block timestamp to control the outcome of the random number generation, potentially winning the lottery multiple times or avoiding paying fees.",926,107,4.6059181690216064
132,short addresses," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to short address attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the `sendCoin` function handles the `to` address. In Solidity, addresses are 20 bytes long, but when they are passed as arguments to functions, they can be padded with zeros. If an attacker uses a short address (less than 20 bytes), the contract might interpret it as a different address, leading to funds being sent to an unintended recipient.

To fix this issue, the `sendCoin` function should explicitly check the length of the `to` address and reject any short addresses:

```solidity
function sendCoin(address to, uint amount) returns(bool sufficient) {
    if (to.length!= 20) throw;
    if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) return false;
    balances[msgEE.sender] -= amount;
    balances[to] += amount;
    Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
    return true;
}
```

This change ensures that only valid, 20-byte addresses are accepted, mitrighting the short address vulnerability.",919,265,11.082874774932861
133,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. This function can be exploited by repeatedly calling it to clear the `creditorAddresses` array, which could lead to a situation where the contract is unable to perform its intended function.",884,71,3.1265711784362793
134,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles dynamic array resizing. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the array is being resized and elements are being added:

- Line 18: `for(uint i=0;i<numbers;i++) {`
- Line 19: `if(numElements == array.length) {`
- Line 20: `array.length += 1;`
- Line 21: `}`
- Line 22: `array[numElements++] = value;`

The issue is that Solidity does not allow for dynamic resizing of arrays in a loop. The line `array.length += 1;` is not valid Solidity syntax and will result in a compilation error. However, if we assume that the intention was to resize the array using the correct syntax, the operation would still be problematic.

Resizing an array in a loop can lead to a Denial of Service attack because it can consume a significant amount of gas, potentially causing the transaction to fail due to insufficient gas. This can be exploited by an attacker who repeatedly calls the `insertNnumbers` function with a large number of elements, causing the contract to run out of gas and become unresponsive",1011,301,12.539911270141602
135,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the reset of the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays when a new credit cycle starts. This vulnerability is present in the lines:

```solidity
creditorAddresses = new address[](0);
creditorAmounts = new uint[](0);
```

When the `lendGovernmentMoney` function is called and the condition `lastTimeOfNewCredit + TWELVE_HOURS < block.timestamp` is met, the contract resets the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays to empty arrays. This means that all the previously stored creditor addresses and amounts are lost, and the contract cannot process any further transactions for those creditors.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the `lendGovernmentMoney` function with a small amount of Ether, causing the contract to reset the arrays and effectively denying service to legitimate creditors. This can lead to a situation where the contract is unable to process any further transactions, effectively taking it offline.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should not reset the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays when a new credit cycle starts. Instead, it should append new cred",2435,301,13.34300708770752
136,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[right]]);
```

This line attempts to send Ether to each address in the `refundAddresses` array. If any of these addresses fail to accept the Ether (e.g., due to an error or a malicious intent), the entire transaction will fail and roll back, causing a denial of service. This is because the `require` statement will revert the transaction if the `send` function returns false.

Additionally, the `approveAndCall` function is also vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The function allows an external contract to call the `receiveApproval` function, which can be abused by an attacker to repeatedly call the function and consume gas, leading to a denial of service.",911,223,9.388301372528076
137,denial of service," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function, specifically in the lines where it pushes 350 addresses of the sender (`msg.sender`) into the `listAddresses` array for each call to the function. An attacker can repeatedly call this function, filling the `listAddresses` array with their addresses. Once the array reaches its maximum size of 1500, the function resets the array to an empty array, effectively removing all previously stored addresses.

This can be used to disrupt the contract's functionality if other parts of the contract rely on the `listAddresses` array being populated with a certain number of addresses. The attacker can repeatedly call the `ifillArray` function, causing the contract to reset the array and potentially leading to a Denial of Service condition.",729,195,8.177947282791138
138,denial of service," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `approveAndEE` function, specifically in the line that executes the `.call()` method:

```solidity
if(!_spender.call(bytes4(bytes32(sha3(""receiveApproval(address,uint256,address,bytes)""))), msg.sender, _value, this, _extraData)) { throw; }
```

This line is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack, which is a type of DoS attack. In a reentrancy attack, an attacker can call the `approveAndCall` function repeatedly before the initial call is finished, potentially draining the contract's funds.

The issue arises because the contract calls an external contract (`_spender`) and then continues to execute after the call. If `_spender` is malicious and has a fallback function that calls back into the `approveAndCall` function, it can repeatedly withdraw funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which ensures that all state changes are made before calling external contracts. Here's an updated version of the `approveAndCall` function:
