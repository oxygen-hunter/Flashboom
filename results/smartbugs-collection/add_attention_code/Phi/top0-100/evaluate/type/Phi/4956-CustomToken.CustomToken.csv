The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control, which can be bypassed by a malicious actor. However, in this specific code snippet, the vulnerability does not stem from `tx.origin` but rather from the fact that the `newOwner` function does not properly restrict who can add new owners.

The `newOwner` function allows any user to add a new owner by setting the `owners` mapping for the `_owner` address to `msg.sender`. This means that any user can add themselves or another user as an owner, which can lead to unauthorized control over the contract's functionality.

To fix this vulnerability, the `newOwner` function should be restricted to only allow the root owner or the current owner to add new owners. This can be achieved by adding an `onlyOwner` modifier to the `newOwner` function, similar to the `deleteOwner` function.

Here's an updated version of the `MultiOwnable` contract with the fixed `newOwner` function:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.23;

contract MultiOwnable {
  address public root;
  mapping (address => address) public owners;  

   
  constructor() public {
    root = msg.sender",access control,4.0,780.0,6.0,2.810621976852417
12,access control," YES

The smart contract code provided is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. However, in the given code snippet, the access control is implemented using the `onlyowner` modifier, which checks if the `msg.sender` is equal to the `owner`. This is a correct approach for access control and does not exhibit the specific vulnerability mentioned in the initial explanation.

But, there is another issue in the code that could potentially lead to vulnerabilities. The `CustomToken` function is marked as `public`, which means it can be called by any external account. This function is responsible for initializing the token's properties and minting the initial supply to the owner's address. If an attacker can call this function, they could potentially manipulate the token's properties or mint additional tokens.

To fix this issue, the `CustomToken` function should be marked as `internal` or `private` to prevent external accounts from calling it. Additionally, the token's properties should be initialized in a separate constructor function or through a factory contract to ensure proper encapsulation and security.

In summary, the provided code is not vulnerable to the access control issue mentioned in the initial explanation, but it does have a potential vulnerability related to the `CustomToken` function being publicly accessible.",access control,2.0,780.0,6.0,2.529916524887085

The given code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for authorization checks. This can lead to re-entrancy attacks where an attacker can call a function that makes an external call to the same contract, potentially draining funds.

15,access control," YES

The smart contract code provided is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` to validate callers in the `onlyowner` modifier. However, in this specific code snippet, the `onlyowner` modifier is not using `tx.origin` but rather `msg.sender`, which is the correct way to check the sender of the transaction. Therefore, the vulnerability mentioned in the explanation does not apply to this code.

However, there is another issue in the code that could potentially lead to vulnerabilities. The `CustomToken` function is marked as `public`, which means it can be called by any external account. This function is responsible for initializing the token's properties and minting the initial supply to the owner's address. If an attacker can call this function, they could potentially manipulate the token's properties or mint additional tokens.

To fix this issue, the `CustomToken` function should be marked as `internal` or `private` to restrict its access to the contract's own functions only. This would prevent external accounts from calling the function and potentially causing issues with the token's properties or supply.

Here's the updated code with the `CustomToken` function marked as `private`:

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `set` function (line 20), which allows anyone to modify the `map` array without proper access control checks. This means that any user can add or change the key-value pairs in the `map` array, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications of the contract's state.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` constructor function (lines 15-26) is public, which means that any user can call this function and initialize the contract with their own token parameters. This could lead to unauthorized creation of tokens and potential misuse of the contract's functionality.

To fix these vulnerabilities, proper access control checks should be implemented in the `set` function to ensure that only authorized users can modify the `map` array.

Delegatecall is a powerful feature in Solidity that allows a contract to execute code in the context of another contract. However, it can be dangerous if used with untrusted contracts, as it can lead to access control bypasses and other security issues.

19,access control," YES

The smart contract code provided is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. However, in the given code snippet, there is no direct use of `tx.origin`. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `onlyowner` modifier is not being used in the `CustomToken` function, which means that any user can call this function and potentially manipulate the token's properties. This could lead to unauthorized creation of tokens or alteration of token details.

Additionally, the `Constructor` function is not actually a constructor in Solidity 0.4.24, as the keyword `constructor` was introduced in later versions. Instead, it should be named `init` or similar to be used as an initializer. The use of `Constructor` as a function name can lead to confusion and potential misuse.

Lastly, the `CustomToken` function is marked as `public`, which means it can be called by any external account, not just the owner. This could lead to unauthorized creation of tokens and manipulation of token properties.

To fix these issues, the `CustomToken` function should be marked as `onlyowner` and renamed to `init` or similar to be used as an initializer.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `tx.origin` for access control in the `migrateTo` function. Although `tx.origin` is not explicitly used in the provided code snippet, it is a common access control mechanism that can be problematic. However, the vulnerability in this code lies in the fact that the `creator` variable is set in the constructor and not protected from being changed afterward. This means that if an attacker can somehow change the `creator` variable after the contract is deployed, they could potentially call the `migrateTo` function and transfer all the funds to another address.

To fix this vulnerability, the `creator` variable should be declared as `immutable` or `private` and set in the constructor, ensuring that it cannot be changed after the contract is deployed. Additionally, it is recommended to use a more secure access control mechanism, such as using a modifier to check if the caller is the owner or a designated admin, instead of relying on `tx.origin`.",access control,4.0,729.0,6.0,3.643505334854126

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues due to the use of `tx.origin` for checking the caller's address. This is a known issue in Solidity, as `tx.origin` can be easily spoofed by a malicious contract that calls the function.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in both the `withdraw` and fallback functions. The `delegatecall` function allows a contract to execute code in the context of another contract, which can lead to access control issues if not properly managed.

In this case, the `withdraw` function uses `delegatecall` to execute the `setFibonacci` function in the `fibonacciLibrary` contract. This means that any contract that can call the `withdraw` function can also call the `setFibonacci` function in the `fibonardLibrary` contract. This can lead to unauthorized access to the `fibonacciLibrary` contract's state and logic.

Similarly, the fallback function uses `delegatecall` to execute the `msg.data` function in the `fibonacciLibrary` contract. This means that any contract that can call the fallback function can also execute arbitrary code in the context of the `fibonacciLibrary` contract. This can lead to unauthorized access to the `fibonacciLibrary` contract's state and logic.

To fix this vulnerability, the `delegatecall` should be replaced with a safer alternative, such as direct function calls or using a proxy contract with access control mechanisms.",access control,3.0,772.0,6.0,2.207646131515503

This line is using the low-level call() function, which does not check for errors and can lead to fail-opens and other unwanted outcomes. If the call fails, the code will continue to run, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use the safeTransferFrom() function instead of the low-level call() function. This function checks for errors and reverts the transaction if the transfer fails.

99,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 54:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

In this line, the contract is sending Ether to the `msg.sender` and then immediately updating the `balances[msg.sender]` without checking the balance first. This allows a malicious contract to call the `Collect` function recursively before the balance is updated, potentially draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance before sending Ether to the `msg.sender`. Here's an example of how to fix the vulnerability:

```solidity
function Collect(uint _am)
    public
    payable
    {
        if(balances[msg.sender] >= MinSum && balances[msg.sender] >= _am)

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the Reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `airDrop()` function of the `ModifierEntrancy` contract, which is called within the `supportsToken()` function of the `attack` contract. This allows the `supportsToken()` function to make a recursive call to the `airDrop()` function before the initial execution is complete, potentially leading to unexpected behavior and state changes.

In the `attack` contract, the `supportsToken()` function checks if `hasBeenCalled` is true. If it is not, it sets `hasBeenCalled` to true and calls `ModifierEntrancy(msg.sender).airDrop()`. This recursive call can be exploited by a malicious contract that implements the fallback function to repeatedly call the `airDrop()` function, draining funds from the `ModifierEntrancy` contract.

If any of the addresses in the array fail to accept the Ether (either because they are not online or they have insufficient funds), the `require` statement will revert the transaction, causing the entire `refundAll` function to fail. This can lead to a denial of service, as the function will not be able to complete its execution and refund the Ether to all the intended addresses.",denial of service,3.0,671.0,6.0,2.687817096710205
137,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function, specifically in lines 17 and 18:

Line 17: `for(uint i=0;i<350;i++) {`
Line 18: `listAddresses.push(msg.sender);`

The `ifillArray` function allows any user to call it and add up to 350 addresses to the `listAddresses` array. This can be exploited by an attacker to fill the array with their own addresses, causing the function to return `false` and preventing other users from adding addresses to the array. This effectively denies service to legitimate users who want to use the `ifillArray` function.

Additionally, the `CustomToken` function is not vulnerable to denial of service, but it has other issues such as not following the ERC20 standard and not using the `SafeMath` library for arithmetic operations, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities in the future.",denial of service,4.0,723.0,6.0,1.7885017395019531
138,denial of service," YES

The smart contract code provided is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the same issue as the first contract: the `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid))` line. This line attempts to send the current bid amount to the previous highest bidder. If the `currentFrontrunner` is not set (i.e., is `0x0` or another address that does not have enough ETH to cover the `currentBid`), the transaction will fail, and the bid function will revert. This can be exploited by repeatedly calling the bid function with a higher bid than the current highest bid, causing the contract to attempt to send ETH to an address that cannot cover the bid, leading to a DoS condition where the contract is stuck in a state where it cannot process new bids.",denial of service,3.0,692.0,6.0,3.0998568534851074
