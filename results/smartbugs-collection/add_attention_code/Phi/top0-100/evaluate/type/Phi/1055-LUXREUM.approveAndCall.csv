The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. Although it is not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, the `MultiOwnable` contract is commonly used in conjunction with other contracts that may rely on `tx.origin` for access control. This can lead to vulnerabilities if the `MultiOwnable` contract is used in a proxy pattern where `tx.origin` is not the actual caller of the contract functions.

In the `MultiOwnable` contract, the `onlyOwner` modifier is used to restrict access to certain functions. However, if the `MultiOwnable` contract is used in a proxy pattern with `delegatecall`, the `tx.origin` will not be the actual caller, and the `onlyOwner` modifier will not work as intended. This can lead to unautrighted access to the contract's functionality.

To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a more secure access control mechanism, such as using a whitelist of authorized addresses or using a more secure modifier that checks the actual caller of the contract functions.",access control,3.0,745.0,6.0,2.5200717449188232
12,access control," YES

The smart contract code provided is vulnerable due to the use of `msg.sender` in the `LUXREUM()` function on line 18. This function assigns the total supply of tokens to the address that deploys the contract, which is not the intended behavior for a token contract. The `missing()` function on line 24 sets the `owner` to the address that deploys the contract, which means that the deployer of the contract will have the `owner` role. This is a significant access control issue because it allows the deployer to withdraw all tokens from the contract without any further authorization checks.

Additionally, the `approveAndCall` function on line 27 allows any address to approve another address to spend tokens on behalf of the calling address. This function does not check if the calling address is the owner or has any other authorization, which could lead to unautrightful spending of tokens.

Lastly, the `withdraw` function on line 34 is correctly protected by the `onlyowner` modifier, but due to the issues mentioned above, the deployer of the contract can still withdraw all tokens without any authorization checks.",access control,4.0,754.0,6.0,3.279301643371582

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `set` function, specifically in the line `map[key] = value;`. This function allows anyone to modify the `map` array, which could lead to unautrightful changes in the contract's state.

In the `set` function, there is no access control mechanism to restrict who can modify the `map` array. This means that any user can call the `set` function and change the values in the `map` array, potentially leading to unauthorized changes in the contract's state.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add an access control mechanism to the `set` function, such as requiring the caller to be the owner of the contract or to have a specific role. This can be done by adding a modifier to the `set` function that checks the caller's permissions before allowing them to modify the `map` array.

Here's an example of how you can add an access control mechanism to the `set` function:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

This line uses the `call` method to send a message to the `_spender` address, which could be a malicious contract. The `call` method is used to execute code on the `_spender` contract, and if the `_spender` contract has a fallback function or a function that can be called with the provided arguments, it can execute arbitrary code.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who controls the `_spender` contract. The attacker can create a malicious contract with a fallback function that can drain the funds from the `Wallet` contract or perform other malicious actions.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `airDrop()` function in the `ModifierEntrancy` contract. The function modifier `supportsToken()` is used to check if the token is supported, and the function modifier `hasNoBalance` is used to ensure that the sender has no balance of the token. However, the `airDrop()` function directly modifies the `tokenBalance` mapping without any checks or protections against reentrancy.

In the `attack` contract, the `call()` function calls `ModifierEntrancy(token).airDrop()` without any checks or protections against reentrancy. This means that an attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the `supportsToken()` function and then calls the `airDrop()` function, causing the `tokenBalance` mapping to be modified multiple times before the initial execution is complete. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `airDrop()` function should be modified to use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, where all checks and effects are performed before any external interactions.

This can be exploited by repeatedly calling the `addCreditors` function to fill the array and then calling the `emptyCreditors` function to clear it, potentially causing a DoS by making the contract unable to process legitimate requests.",denial of service,3.0,638.0,6.0,2.2037644386291504

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles dynamic array resizing in the `insertNnumbers` function. The vulnerability lies in the lines where the array is resized and elements are added:

- Line 18: `for(uint i=0;i<numbers;i++) {`
- Line 19: `if(numElements == array.length) {`
- Line 20: `array.length += 1;`
- Line 21: `}`
- Line 22: `array[numElements++] = value;`

The issue is that the contract does not have a mechanism to limit the rate at which the array is resized and elements are added. An attacker can call the `insertNnumbers` function repeatedly with a large number of elements, causing the contract to continuously resize the array and consume all available gas. This can lead to a denial of service as the contract may run out of gas or become unresponsive due to the excessive computation required.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should implement a rate-limiting mechanism or a maximum size limit for the array to prevent excessive resizing and gas consumption.",denial of service,3.0,760.0,6.0,1.8809726238250732

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the resetting of the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays to empty arrays when a new credit cycle starts. This can be exploited by repeatedly calling the `lendGovernmentMoney` function, which will continuously reset the arrays and prevent legitimate creditors from being able to receive their funds.",denial of service,3.0,604.0,6.0,2.9413938522338867
136,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the same reason as the first contract. The vulnerability lies in line 24:

```solidity
require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));
```

This line attempts to send Ether to each address in the `refundAddresses` array. If any of the addresses in the array is not willing to accept the Ether or if there is an issue with the transaction, the entire `refundAll` function will fail, causing a denial of service.",denial of service,3.0,635.0,6.0,3.946061611175537
137,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function, specifically in the lines:

```solidity
for(uint i=0;i<350;i++) {
    listAddresses.push(msg.sender);
}
```

This function allows any user to call it and fill the `listAddresses` array with up to 350 addresses. If an attacker repeatedly calls this function, they can fill the array with their own address, causing the function to return `false` and effectively preventing other users from adding addresses to the array. This can lead to a denial of service, as the array will not be able to accept new addresses once it reaches the limit of 1500 addresses.

Additionally, the contract does not have any access control or rate limiting mechanisms in place to prevent an attacker from repeatedly calling the `ifillArray` function. This makes it even more susceptible to denial of service attacks.",denial of service,4.0,716.0,6.0,3.010667562484741
138,denial of service," YES

The smart contract code provided is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the same issue as the first contract: the require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid)) line. This line attempts to send the currentBid amount to the currentFrontrunner, which is the previous highest bidder. If the currentFrontrunner has no ETH or the account is not properly configured to receive ETH, the transaction will fail, causing the bid function to revert and effectively denying service to the user attempting to place a bid.",denial of service,3.0,630.0,6.0,2.604142904281616
