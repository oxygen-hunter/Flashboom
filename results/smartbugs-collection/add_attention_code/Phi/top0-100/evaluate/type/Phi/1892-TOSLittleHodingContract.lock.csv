The smart contract code provided is vulnerable due to the following reasons:

1. The `missing` function is public and does not have any access control, allowing anyone to set the `owner` address. This can lead to unauthorized control of the contract.

2. The `lock` function allows anyone to lock tokens without proper access control, which can lead to manipulation of the contract's state and potential loss of funds.

3. The `withdraw` function is public and has the `onlyowner` modifier, but it uses `owner.transfer(this.balance)` instead of `payable` or `transfer(address _to, uint256 _value)` which can lead to a reentrancy attack.

4. The contract uses the deprecated `tx.origin` to validate callers, which can be exploited by attackers.

5. The contract uses `delegatecall` in proxy libraries or proxy contracts, which can lead to unauthorized access to the contract's private logic.

6. The contract uses `require(now <= HOLDING_START)` in the `lock` function, which can be exploited by attackers to manipulate the contract's state.

15,access control," YES

The smart contract code provided is vulnerable due to the use of `tx.origin` in the `onlyowner` modifier. However, in this specific code snippet, the `onlyowner` modifier is not actually using `tx.origin`. Instead, it is using `msg.sender`, which is the correct way to check the actual sender of the transaction. Therefore, based on the provided code, the access control vulnerability related to `tx.origin` is not present.

However, there is still a potential vulnerability in the `lock` function. The `lock` function allows anyone to lock tokens as long as the current time is less than or equal to `HOLDING_START`. This could potentially be exploited by an attacker who can manipulate the system time on their local machine.

Additionally, the `lock` function does not check if the `msg.sender` is the owner of the contract, which means that any user can call the `lock` function and lock tokens. This could lead to an attacker locking tokens without being the owner of the contract.

To fix these issues, you should add a check in the `lock` function to ensure that the `msg.sender` is the owner of the contract, and you should remove the time-based condition or implement a more secure time-based condition.",access control,4.0,780.0,6.0,2.71773362159729

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `lock` function, specifically in the line where it updates the `lockBalanceOf` mapping:

```solidity
lockBalanceOf[msg.sender] = lockBalanceOf[msg.sender].add(lockAmount).add(reward);
```

This line allows any caller to update their balance in the `lockBalanceOf` mapping, which should only be possible for the owner of the contract. To fix this vulnerability, the `lock` function should be marked as `onlyOwner` or use a modifier that checks if the caller is the owner before executing the function.

Additionally, the `set` function is also vulnerable to access control issues. It allows any caller to update the `map` array, which should only be possible for the owner of the contract. To fix this vulnerability, the `set` function should be marked as `onlyOwner` or use a modifier that checks if the caller is the owner before executing the function.

In summary, the contract is vulnerable to access control issues because it allows any caller to update the `lockBalanceOf` and `map` mappings, which should only be possible for the owner of the contract.",access control,3.0,769.0,6.0,2.2363829612731934

However, the provided code snippet does not contain the `tx.origin` usage, so we cannot directly identify a vulnerability based on the provided code.

But, there is a potential vulnerability in the `lock` function. The `lock` function allows anyone to lock tokens and receive rewards without proper access control. This could lead to an attack where an attacker calls the `lock` function and receives rewards without actually owning the tokens.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add access control to the `lock` function, ensuring that only the token owner or authorized users can call it.",access control,4.0,671.0,6.0,3.276073694229126
19,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. The `onlyowner` modifier checks if the `msg.sender` is equal to the `owner`, which is fine for direct transactions. However, if a contract is called through another contract, `msg.sender` will be the address of the calling contract, not the actual user. This can lead to unautrighted access if the calling contract is controlled by an attacker.

Additionally, the contract uses the `Constructor` function with the `public` visibility, which means it can be called by anyone. This could potentially allow an attacker to create multiple instances of the contract and claim ownership, leading to a reentrancy attack.

Lastly, the contract uses the `SafeERC20` and `SafeMath` libraries, which are not vulnerable by themselves, but it's essential to ensure that the libraries are up-to-date and free of vulnerabilities.",access control,4.0,714.0,6.0,2.4828989505767822

This function allows any user to transfer their balance to themselves, effectively draining the contract's funds. The `msg.sender` can be any user, not just the creator or an authorized user. This is a critical vulnerability as it allows any user to drain the contract's funds without any restrictions.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in both the `withdraw` and fallback functions. The `delegatecall` function allows the contract to execute code in the context of another contract, which can lead to access control issues if not properly managed.

In the `withdraw` function, the `delegatecall` is used to call the `setFibonacci` function in the `fibonacciLibrary` contract. This could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the `fibonacciLibrary` contract if they can control the input to the `delegatecall`.

Similarly, in the fallback function, the `delegatecall` is used to call the `msg.data` function in the `fibonacciLibrary` contract. This could also allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the `fibonacciLibrary` contract if they can control the input to the `delegatecall`.

To fix this vulnerability, you should avoid using `delegatecall` in the fallback function and instead use a more secure method to access the functionality of the `fibonacciLibrary` contract.

This condition checks if the current block timestamp is less than the last investment timestamp plus one minute. However, as mentioned in the provided explanation, the block timestamp can be manipulated by miners, which means an attacker could potentially manipulate the block timestamp to bypass this condition and call the resetInvestment function at an undesired time.

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to reset the investment and jackpot at a time that is not intended by the contract creator, potentially leading to loss of funds or other unintended consequences.",time manipulation,3.0,666.0,6.0,3.2313289642333984
130,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same lines as the original code you provided:

The vulnerability lies in line 27:
    require(now!= pastBlockTime); // only 1 transaction per block

The vulnerability lies in line 29:
    pastBlockTime = now;

In both cases, the contract relies on the `now` value, which can be manipulated by miners. This allows an attacker to potentially exploit the contract by manipulating the block timestamp to trigger the `if(now % 15 == 0)` condition and claim the rewards.",time manipulation,3.0,642.0,6.0,2.7165658473968506
131,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in line 43:
var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;

This line uses block.timestamp to generate a random number, which can be manipulated by miners. An attacker with control over the mining process could potentially influence the outcome of the lottery by adjusting the timestamp of the block in which the play function is called.",time manipulation,3.0,606.0,6.0,2.460277795791626
132,short addresses," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a short address attack. The vulnerability lies in the `sendCoin` function, specifically in the line where the `to` address is used without proper validation. The `to` address is directly taken from the function arguments and used in the `balances[to] += amount;` line. If an attacker uses a short address (a shorter version of a valid Ethereum address), it could lead to incorrect balances being updated, as the contract would interpret the short address as a different, potentially non-existent, account.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should validate the `to` address before using it in the `balances` mapping. This can be done by checking if the address is a 20-byte Ethereum address and ensuring it is not a short address.",short addresses,3.0,683.0,6.0,2.102566957473755
133,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the function checks if the length of `creditorAddresses` is greater than 1500, and if so, it resets the array to an empty array with zero elements. This can be exploited by repeatedly calling the `addCreditors` function to fill the `creditorAddresses` array and then calling the `emptyCreditors` function to reset it, effectively causing a DoS attack by preventing the contract from functioning correctly.",denial of service,3.0,646.0,6.0,2.6844751834869385
134,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles dynamic array resizing in the `insertNnumbers` function. The vulnerability lies in the lines where the contract attempts to resize the `array` if `numElements` exceeds its current length.

The issue is with the line:

```solidity
array.length += 1;
```

In Solidity, arrays are fixed-size, and the `length` property cannot be directly modified. The correct way to resize an array is to use the `push` method, which internally handles the resizing. The line above does not resize the array and will not add any new elements to it.

This vulnerability can be exploited by repeatedly calling the `insertNnumbers` function with a large number of elements, causing the contract to attempt to resize the array without actually adding any new elements. This can lead to a Denial of Service attack by consuming gas and potentially causing the contract to run out of gas, making it unresponsive.

To fix this vulnerability, the `insertNnumbers` function should be updated to use the `push` method to add elements to the array:

```solidity
for(uint i=0;i<numbers;i++) {
    array.push(value);
}
```

135,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the contract allows the government to reset the creditorAddresses and creditorAmounts arrays to empty arrays when a new credit cycle starts. This can be exploited by repeatedly calling the lendGovernmentMoney function, which would eventually clear all the creditor records and prevent legitimate creditors from receiving their funds.

Additionally, the contract allows the government to send funds to the corruptElite address, which could be exploited by an attacker to drain the contract's funds. The contract also does not have any access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive functions, which could lead to further vulnerabilities.",denial of service,4.0,655.0,6.0,2.8312838077545166
136,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the same reason as the first contract: the `refundAll` function iterates over the `refundAddresses` array and attempts to send Ether to each address using the `send` method. If any of the addresses fail to accept the transaction (e.g., due to insuperfice balance, contract not being deployed, or other reasons), the transaction will fail, and the `refundAll` function will not proceed to the next address. This can cause the function to hang indefinitely if it encounters a failing transaction, effectively denying service to the rest of the addresses in the array.",denial of service,3.0,657.0,6.0,1.7773120403289795
137,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function, specifically in lines 24 and 25:

```solidity
for(uint i=0;i<350;i++) {
    listAddresses.push(msg.sender);
}
```

This function allows any user to push up to 350 addresses into the `listAddresses` array. If an attacker repeatedly calls this function, they can fill the array with their addresses, potentially causing the array to reach its maximum size limit. When the array is full, the function will reset it to an empty array, which could lead to a DoS attack by repeatedly filling and emptying the array.

In a DoS attack, the attacker can prevent legitimate users from accessing the contract's functionality by consuming the contract's resources, such as gas and storage. In this case, the attacker can fill the `listAddresses` array with their addresses, causing the contract to continuously reset the array and consume gas. This can lead to a denial of service for other users trying to interact with the contract.",denial of service,3.0,750.0,6.0,3.27532958984375
138,denial of service," YES

The smart contract code provided is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the same issue as the first contract: the require statement that sends the currentBid to the currentFrontrunner. If the currentFrontrunner's address is a contract that does not handle the Ether sent to it properly, or if it's a contract that is designed to fail or is not always online, it could cause the function to fail and prevent further bids from being processed. This could effectively take the auction offline.",denial of service,3.0,631.0,6.0,3.493865966796875
