The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the `tx.origin` property in the `newOwner` function. The `tx.origin` property refers to the original transaction sender, which can be exploited in a transaction-replay attack. In this attack, an attacker can trick a contract into executing a function by reusing the transaction hash of a previous transaction where the attacker was the original sender.

In the `newOwner` function, the contract checks if the address passed as `_owner` is the same as `tx.origin`. If it is, the contract allows the `_owner` to be set as a new owner. This can be exploited by an attacker who sends a transaction with a different address as the sender but reuses the transaction hash of a previous transaction where they were the original sender. The contract would then set the attacker as the new owner, even though they are not the intended owner.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use the `msg.sender` property instead of `tx.origin` to check the address of the function caller. The `msg.sender` property refers to the immediate caller of the function, which is more secure and prevents transaction-replay attacks.",access control,2.0,764.0,6.0,3.0948233604431152

The given Solidity code is vulnerable due to the use of the `tx.origin` property in the `collectAllFees` and `collectFeesInEther` functions. The `tx.origin` property refers to the original transaction initiator, which can be exploited in a transaction-replay attack. In this attack, a malicious user can trick another user into executing a transaction that was not intended for them, potentially leading to unauthorized actions within the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you can replace the `tx.origin` check with a more secure approach, such as using a modifier that checks the caller's address against a list of authorized addresses or implementing a more robust access control mechanism.",access control,3.0,659.0,6.0,3.100105047225952
14,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `getAllowedAmountByTeam` function. The function uses a series of `if` and `else if` statements to determine the allowed amount based on the current date. However, the function does not have a final `else` statement to handle cases where the current date does not match any of the specified conditions. This can lead to an unexpected behavior where the function returns 0, which may not be the intended outcome.

Additionally, the function uses the `now` global variable to compare with the `_startTime` and `_startTime + (x days)` values. The `now` global variable is not recommended to be used in Solidity contracts due to its potential for reentrancy attacks. Instead, it is recommended to use the `block.timestamp` property, which provides the current block timestamp.

To fix this vulnerability, you can add a final `else` statement to handle cases where the current date does not match any of the specified conditions, and use the `block.timestamp` property instead of the `now` global variable.",access control,2.0,746.0,6.0,2.6402735710144043
15,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the `now` keyword in the `getAllowedAmountByEE` function. The `now` keyword in Solidity refers to the current timestamp in seconds since the Unix epoch. However, the contract does not have a mechanism to update the `now` value, which means that the time-based logic in the function will not work as intended.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `now` value is not updated, and the time-based logic will always return the same result, regardless of the actual date and time. This can lead to incorrect calculations of the allowed amount for the team token, potentially allowing unauthorized access to the token or causing other unintended consequences.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a time-based oracle or a time-keeping service to obtain the current timestamp and update the `now` value accordingly. This will ensure that the time-based logic in the `getAllowedAmountByEE` function works as intended and prevents unautocess to the team token.",access control,2.0,733.0,6.0,2.4834187030792236

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the way it handles the `getAllowedAmountByTeam` function. The function returns a specific amount of tokens based on the current date, which could potentially be exploited by an attacker.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the function returns a fixed amount of tokens based on the current date, without any checks or restrictions on who can access this function. This means that any user can call this function and obtain the allowed amount of tokens for their team, regardless of whether they are actually part of the team or not.

An attacker could create multiple accounts and call this function repeatedly to obtain the allowed amount of tokens for different dates, effectively stealing tokens from the contract. This is a vulnerability because the function does not verify the caller's identity or their association with the team, allowing anyone to access the token amounts.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should implement proper access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can call the `getAllowedAmountByTeam` function and obtain the allowed amount of tokens for their team. This could be achieved by using modifiers or checks to verify the caller's identity and their association with the team before allowing them to access the token amounts.",access control,3.0,765.0,6.0,3.6304988861083984

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the `getAllowedAmountByTeam` function and accumulating tokens over time. This could lead to a significant loss of tokens for the contract owner.

To fix this vulnerability, the `getAllowedAmountByTeam` function should be modified to include the `onlyowner` modifier, ensuring that only the owner of the contract can call this function.",access control,3.0,674.0,6.0,3.0248758792877197
20,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the function `getAllowedAmountByTeam`, which uses a series of `if-else` statements to determine the allowed amount based on the current date. This logic can be exploited by an attacker who can manipulate the `now` variable to match a specific date condition, allowing them to obtain a larger amount of tokens than intended.

For example, an attacker could call the `getAllowedAmountByTeam` function with a `now` value set to a date that matches one of the conditions in the `if-else` statements, resulting in a larger amount of tokens being returned. This could be done by using a blockchain client that allows the user to set the timestamp of a transaction, or by finding a block with a timestamp that matches the desired date.

Additionally, the use of `uint(24)` in the calculations is not a standard practice and could lead to confusion or errors in the code. It would be better to use `24u` or `24` instead.

For example, consider the case when `_teamTokenAmount` is divided by `uint(24)` and then multiplied by `23`. If `_teamTokenAmount` is a very large number, the division operation might result in an overflow, leading to an incorrect value being returned. This can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the allowed amount of tokens for the team.

The vulnerability lies in the `add` function:

```solidity
function add(uint value) returns (bool){
    sellerBalance += value;

```

The `+=` operator performs an addition operation, and if the result exceeds the maximum value of a uint (2^256 - 1), it will wrap around to 0, causing an integer overflow. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploitation by attackers.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library provided by OpenZeppelin, which includes overflow-safe arithmetic operations. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath in the `add` function:

```solidity

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the `getAllowedAmountByTeam` function, where the arithmetic operations could result in an integer overflow or underflow.

For example, consider the case when `_teamTokenAmount` is divided by `uint(24)` and then multiplied by `23`. If `_teamTokenAmount` is a very large number, the division operation could result in an integer overflow, causing the result to wrap around and become a much smaller number. This smaller number, when multiplied by `23`, could result in a value that is less than the actual allowed amount.

Similarly, if `_teamTokenAmount` is a very small number, the division operation could result in an integer underflow, causing the result to become a very large number. This large number, when multiplied by `23`, could result in a value that is greater than the actual allowed amount.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to reentrancy. The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function, specifically in the line where it calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `Collect` function before the initial execution is complete, leading to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which involves separating the logic into three sections: checking conditions, updating state, and interacting with external contracts. In the case of the `Collect` function, you can first update the state by subtracting the `_am` amount from the account balance, and then interact with the external contract.

This line allows the `msg.sender` to call the `Collect` function again before the state of the contract has been updated, potentially leading to multiple withdrawals or other unintended behavior.

In the `Collect` function, the contract first checks if the account balance is sufficient and if the unlock time has passed. If these conditions are met, it then allows the `msg.sender` to call the `LogFile` contract's `AddMessage` function. This is where the reentrancy vulnerability occurs.

The `AddMessage` function in the `LogFile` contract does not modify the state of the `PENNY_BY_PENNY` contract, but it is called within the `Collect` function of the `PENNY_EE_PENNY` contract. This means that if the `LogFile` contract has a reentrancy vulnerability, it could be exploited to call the `Collect` function multiple times before the state of the `PENNY_BY_PENNY` contract is updated.

This line allows the `msg.sender` to call the `Collect` function again before the state of the contract has been updated, potentially leading to multiple withdrawals or other unintended behavior.

In the `Collect` function, the contract checks if the sender's balance is greater than or equal to the minimum sum and the allowed amount, and if the unlock time has passed. If these conditions are met, the contract allows the sender to withdraw the specified amount. However, the withdrawal is done after the reentrancy call, which means that the sender can call the `Collect` function again before the contract state is updated, leading to a potential reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the state before calling external contracts or functions that could lead to reentrancy.

This line allows the external contract to be called with the `_wei` amount before the state of the contract is updated. If the external contract is malicious and designed to exploit reentrancy, it can call the `WithdrawToHolder` function again before the original function call is completed, potentially draining funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the state (e.s., deducting the amount from the holder's balance) before making the external call. Here's an example of how the `WithdrawToHolder` function can be modified to prevent reentrancy attacks:

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the Reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `airDrop` function of the `ModifierEntrancy` contract. The function modifier `supportsToken` in the `attack` contract allows for a recursive call to the `airDrop` function of the `ModifierEntrancy` contract. This recursive call can be exploited by an attacker to repeatedly call the `airDrop` function before the initial execution is complete, potentially draining funds from the contract.

In the `attack` contract, the `supportsToken` function checks if `hasBeenCalled` is false, and if so, it sets it to true and calls the `airDrop` function of the `ModifierEntrancy` contract. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the `supportsToken` function and drain funds from the `ModifierEntrancy` contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `airDrop` function should not call external contracts that could potentially be malicious.

121,reentrancy," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the line 54:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the contract to send Ether to the msg.sender before executing the rest of the function. If the msg.sender is a malicious contract with a fallback function that calls back into the `Collect` function, it can drain funds from the contract before the balance is updated.

To fix this vulnerability, you should update the balance first and then perform the Ether transfer. Here's an example of how to fix the `Collect` function:

```
function Collect(uint _am)
public
payable
{
    if(balances[msg.sender]>=MinSum && balances[msg.sender]>=_am)
    {
        balances[msg.sender]-=_am;
        Log.AddMessage(msg.sender,_am,""Collect"");

        (bool sent = msg.sender.call.value(_am)(""""));
        require(sent, ""Failed to send Ether"");
    }
}
```

In this fixed version, the balance is updated before the Ether transfer, and the transfer is performed using the `call.value` method with an empty string as the data payload.",reentrancy,3.0,759.0,6.0,2.7911903858184814
122,reentrancy," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the same line as in the first contract: if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)()) in the CashOut function. This allows an attacker to call the CashOut function repeatedly before the balance is updated, leading to potential loss of funds.",reentrancy,3.0,591.0,6.0,3.0120787620544434
123,reentrancy," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This line allows the `msg.sender` to call the `Collect` function again before the initial execution is complete. If the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract, it can exploit this by calling the `Collect` function recursively, draining funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, where all checks and effects are performed before any external contract interactions. In this case, the contract should first update the balance and unlock time of the account, and then perform the external call.

Here's an example of how the `Collect` function can be refactored to avoid the reentrancy vulnerability:

```solidity
function Collect(uint _am)
    public
    payable
    {
        var acc = Acc[msg.sender];

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the same line as the first code snippet, line 38:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

In this line, the contract is calling an external contract (msg.sender) and sending Ether to it before updating the balances. This allows the external contract to potentially call back into the `CashOut` function before the balance update is completed, leading to a reentrancy attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance first and then send the Ether to the external contract. This can be done by changing the order of operations in the `CashOut` function:

function CashOut(uint _am)
{
    if(_am<=balances[msg.sender])
    {
        balances[msg.sender]-=_am;
        TransferLog.AddMessage(msg.sender,_am,""CashOut"");

125,reentrancy," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to reentrancy. The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function, specifically in the line where the contract sends Ether to the caller:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the caller to execute arbitrary code before the contract state is updated, which can lead to reentrancy attacks. An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the `Collect` function and then calls another function in the `BANK_SAFE` contract, potentially draining funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, where all checks and effects are performed before any external calls. In this case, the contract should first deduct the amount from the sender's balance and then make the external call.

Here's an example of how the `Collect` function can be refactored to avoid reentrancy:

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the Reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function, specifically in line 52:

This line allows the external contract to make a recursive call back to the `withdrawBalance` function before the initial execution is complete. This can lead to multiple withdrawals and potential loss of funds.",reentrancy,3.0,608.0,6.0,2.791722536087036
127,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation attacks. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the contract relies on the `block.timestamp` to determine the allowed amount of tokens for the team during the crowdsale. Since miners have some leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, an attacker could potentially manipulate the block timestamp to gain more tokens than they are entitled to.

In the provided code, the `getAllowedAmountByTeam` function calculates the allowed amount of tokens based on the current block timestamp. If an attacker can manipulate the block timestamp, they can trick the contract into thinking that the current time is earlier or later than it actually is, and thus gain more tokens than they should.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should not rely solely on the `block.timestamp` for critical logic. Instead, it could use a combination of block timestamps and other mechanisms, such as a trusted time oracle or a block number-based approach, to make the contract more resistant to time manipulation attacks.",time manipulation,3.0,725.0,6.0,3.803734064102173
128,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation.

The vulnerability lies in the `getAllowedAmountByTeam` function, where the contract relies on the `now` variable to determine the allowed token amount for the team. Since `now` is derived from `block.timestamp`, miners can manipulate the timestamp by a few seconds, which can affect the outcome of the function. This manipulation can lead to incorrect token amounts being distributed to the team, potentially causing financial losses.",time manipulation,3.0,618.0,6.0,3.595872640609741

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation attacks. The vulnerability lies in the `resetInvestment` function, where the condition `if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp+ONE_MINUTE)` is used to check if the reset should occur. Since miners can manipulate the timestamp of a block, an attacker could potentially exploit this by mining a block with a timestamp just over one minute after the `lastInvestmentTimestamp`, thus bypassing the condition and triggering the reset prematurely.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should not rely solely on the block timestamp for time-sensitive operations. Instead, it could use a more reliable source of time, such as an external oracle or a time-lock mechanism that doesn't depend on the block timestamp.",time manipulation,3.0,669.0,6.0,3.030654191970825
130,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation attacks. The vulnerability lies in the `getAllowedAmountByTeam` function, which calculates the allowed token amount based on the current time (`now`). An attacker with control over the blockchain's timestamp could manipulate the `now` value to always be within a certain range, allowing them to receive a larger amount of tokens than intended.

For example, an attacker could manipulate the blockchain's timestamp to always be within the range of `_startTime + (334 days)` and `_startTime + (304 days)`, which would result in the function returning `_teamTokenAmount / uint(24) * 11`, a larger amount of tokens than intended.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should not rely on the current time for critical calculations. Instead, it could use a predefined schedule or a trusted oracle to determine the allowed token amount.",time manipulation,3.0,701.0,6.0,3.463930606842041
131,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation attacks.

The vulnerability lies in the function `getAllowedAmountByTeam()` which calculates the allowed amount of tokens based on the current time. The function uses the `now` variable to compare with predefined dates and times. However, the `now` variable is derived from `block.timestamp`, which can be manipulated by miners.

Miners have the ability to report the time at which the mining occurred, and this can be exploited to manipulate the outcome of the `getAllowedAmountByTeam()` function. An attacker with enough mining power could potentially manipulate the block timestamps to always return a specific token amount, regardless of the actual date and time.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a more reliable time source, such as an external oracle or a time service that is not controlled by miners. Additionally, using a time-lock mechanism or a time-based function that does not rely solely on block timestamps can help prevent time manipulation attacks.",time manipulation,3.0,721.0,6.0,2.471263885498047

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `insertNnumbers` function. This function allows an attacker to potentially fill up the contract's storage by inserting a large number of elements into the `array`. If the attacker can repeatedly call this function with a high `numbers` value, they can exhaust the contract's storage, leading to a DoS condition where the contract may become unresponsive or unable to process legitimate transactions.

The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the loop that iterates `numbers` times and inserts elements into the `array`. If an attacker can repeatedly call this function with a large `numbers` value, they can fill up the contract's storage and potentially cause a DoS condition.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you can consider adding a limit to the `numbers` parameter in the `insertNnumbers` function to prevent excessive storage usage. Additionally, you can implement a mechanism to monitor and control the storage usage of the contract to prevent potential DoS attacks.",denial of service,3.0,740.0,6.0,4.082576036453247

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to denial of service (DoS) attacks. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the contract allows any user to withdraw all the funds by calling the `lendGovernmentMoney` function with a zero Ether value. This can be done repeatedly, causing the contract to continuously send funds to the attacker's address, potentially draining the contract's balance.

The vulnerability is present in the following lines of code:

}
else {

In this code, if the `amount` is less than 1 Ether (10^18 wei), the contract sends the funds to the `msg.sender` and returns `false`. However, if the `amount` is exactly 0, the contract will also send the funds to the `msg.sender` and return `false`. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the `lendGovernmentMoney` function with 0 Ether, causing the contract to continuously send funds to the attacker's address.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function, which allows any user to fill the `listAddresses` array with up to 350 addresses per call. This can be exploited by repeatedly calling the `ifillArray` function, causing the gas costs to increase significantly for each call. Since the gas costs are paid by the caller, an attacker can essentially drain the funds of any user who tries to interact with the contract by repeatedly calling the `ifillArray` function.

Additionally, the `getAllowedAmountByTeam` function has a time-based logic that returns different token amounts based on the current date. This can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the token amounts returned by the function, potentially causing financial losses for users interacting with the contract.

In summary, the vulnerability in the `ifillArray` function can lead to a Denial of Service attack by draining the funds of users interacting with the contract, and the time-based logic in the `getAllowedAmountByTeam` function can be exploited to manipulate token amounts.",denial of service,4.0,752.0,6.0,3.226593494415283
