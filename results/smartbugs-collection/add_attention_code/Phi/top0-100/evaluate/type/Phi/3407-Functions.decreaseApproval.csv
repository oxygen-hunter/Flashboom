11,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function of the `MultiOwnable` contract. The issue is that the `newOwner` function allows any user to become an owner by calling the function and passing their address as the `_owner` parameter. This means that any user can become an owner without the consent of the current owners, which is a significant access control issue.

The `newOwner` function should only allow the root owner or other authorized owners to add new owners. This can be achieved by adding an `onlyOwner` modifier to the `newOwner` function, similar to the `deleteOwner` function.

Here's an updated version of the `MultiOwnable` contract with the `newOwner` function secured:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.23;

12,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `decreaseApproval` function of the `Functions` contract. The issue is that the `allowed` mapping does not have a default value, and if a value is not set for a key, it will be `0` by default. This can lead to an underflow when subtracting from an uninitialized value.

In the `decreaseApproval` function, when `_subtractedValue` is greater than `oldValue`, the contract sets `allowed[msg.sender][_spender]` to `0`. However, if `oldValue` is `0` (because it was not set before), this will cause an underflow, as the contract will try to subtract `_subtractedValue` from `0`.

To fix this vulnerability, you can add a check to ensure that `oldValue` is not `0` before subtracting from it, or initialize the `allowed` mapping with a non-zero value when the contract is deployed.",access control,2.0,727.0,6.0,3.7102222442626953

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the `creator` address being publicly settable by any user calling the `DynamicPyrami` function. This allows an attacker to change the `creator` address to their own, potentially enabling them to call the `onlyowner` modifier functions and alter the contract's state or steal funds.",access control,3.0,592.0,6.0,2.6557345390319824
14,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);` in the `withdraw` function. This line of code checks if the requested withdrawal amount is greater than or equal to the balance of the sender. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent underflow attacks.

An underflow attack occurs when a contract subtracts more than the available balance, causing the balance to become negative. In this case, the `balances[msg.sender] -= amount;` line can lead to an underflow if the balance is not sufficient to cover the withdrawal amount.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a library like SafeMath to perform the subtraction operation safely. Here's an updated version of the `withdraw` function using SafeMath:

```solidity

    require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);

In this case, the `onlyowner` modifier checks if `msg.sender` is equal to `owner`, but `msg.sender` can be set to any address by a malicious actor, bypassing the access control.

The vulnerability in the given code is related to the use of the `SafeMath` library. The `decreaseApproval` function in the `Functions` contract uses the `sub` function from the `SafeMath` library to subtract `_subtractedValue` from `oldValue`. If `_subtractedValue` is greater than `oldValue`, the function sets the value to 0.

This can lead to a vulnerability if an attacker finds a way to manipulate `_subtractedValue` to be greater than `oldValue`, causing the contract to set the value to 0. This could potentially lead to unintended consequences, such as removing the approval of a spender when it was not intended.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should include additional checks to ensure that `_subtractedValue` is within a valid range and that the resulting value does not lead to unintended consequences.

In Solidity, the `send` function is a low-level function that can fail silently, meaning it can return false without throwing an error. If the transaction fails, the code will continue to execute, which can lead to unexpected outcomes.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the `transfer` function instead of `send`, as `transfer` reverts the transaction if the transfer fails. Alternatively, you can check the return value of `send` and handle the failure case accordingly.

90,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is still vulnerable to integer overflows.

The reason is that the SafeMath library is not being used in the IntegerOverflowAdd contract. The SafeMath library is designed to prevent integer overflows and underflows by including checks and assertions in its functions. In the provided code, the SafeMath library is used in the Functions contract, but not in the IntegerOverflowAdd contract.

To fix the vulnerability, the IntegerOverflowAdd contract should also use the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations. Here's an example of how the contract can be modified to use SafeMath:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.10;

import ""./SafeMath.sol"";

contract IntegerOverflowAdd {
    mapping (address => uint256) public balanceOf;

    using SafeMath for uint256;

    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public{
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);
        balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender].sub(_value);
        balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to].add(_value);
    }
}

124,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 38:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the `msg.sender` to make a call to the `CashOut` function before the balance update is completed. If the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract, it can exploit this by calling the `CashOut` function recursively, draining funds from the contract before the balance is updated.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests that you should first perform all checks and effects (updates to the state) before interacting with external contracts. In this case, you should update the balance before making the call to the external contract.

Here's an updated version of the `CashOut` function:

function CashOut(uint _am)
{
    if(_am<=balances[msg.sender])
    {
        balances[msg.sender]-=_am;
        TransferLog.AddMessage(msg.sender,_am,""CashOut"");

125,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 54:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

In this line, the contract sends Ether to the `msg.sender` before updating the balance. If the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract with a fallback function that calls back into the `Collect` function, it can withdraw more Ether than it should be allowed to, potentially draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you can follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern, which means updating the state (balances) before sending Ether to external contracts. Here's an updated version of the `Collect` function:

```solidity
function Collect(uint _am)
    public
    payable
    {
        if(balances[msg.sender] >= MinSum && balances[msg.sender] >= _am)

126,reentrancy," YES, the provided smart contract code is still vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

The vulnerability lies in the same line as the previous code:

(bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""");

This line allows the caller's code to be executed, and it can call the `withdrawBalance` function again before the initial execution is complete. This can lead to multiple withdrawals being processed in a single transaction, potentially draining the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests that you should first perform all checks and effects (state changes) before interacting with external contracts. In this case, you should set the user's balance to 0 before sending the funds. Here's an updated version of the `withdrawBalance` function:

function withdrawBalance() public {
    uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
    userBalances[msgEE] = 0;
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""");
    require(success);
}

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `resetInvestment` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp + ONE_MINUTE)
```

This line checks if the current block timestamp is at least one minute after the `lastInvestmentTimestamp`. However, miners have the ability to manipulate the block timestamp within a certain range (usually 15 seconds). This means that a miner could potentially mine a block with a timestamp that is just under one minute after the `lastInvestmentTimestamp`, allowing the `resetInvestment` function to be called prematurely and the funds to be transferred before the intended time.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should use a more reliable source of time or implement a time lock mechanism that does not solely rely on the block timestamp.",time manipulation,3.0,690.0,6.0,2.9975337982177734

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same lines as the previous code:

The vulnerability lies in line 18: `require(now!= pastBlockTime);` // only 1 transaction per block

The vulnerability lies in line 20: `pastBlockTime = now;`

The issue is that the contract relies on the `now` value to determine if 15 seconds have passed since the last transaction. However, miners have the ability to manipulate the timestamp of a block, which can be exploited to bypass the 15-second check. An attacker could create a block with a timestamp that is exactly 15 seconds after the previous block, allowing them to transfer the contract's balance to themselves.",time manipulation,3.0,671.0,6.0,3.795809268951416

133,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. An attacker can repeatedly call the `addCreditors` function to fill the `creditorAddresses` array until it reaches a size of 1500. Once this threshold is reached, the `emptyCreditors` function will be triggered, which clears the entire `creditorAddresses` array. This can be exploited to disrupt the contract's intended functionality by repeatedly adding and removing creditors, effectively causing a DoS condition.",denial of service,3.0,637.0,6.0,2.002084255218506
134,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles the dynamic resizing of the `array` when inserting elements. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the contract checks if `numElements` is equal to `array.length` and then increments `array.length` by 1.

Here's the problematic part of the code:

```solidity
for(uint i=0;i<numbers;i++) {
    if(numElements == array.length) {
        array.length += 1;
    }
    array[numElements++] = value;
}
```

The issue is that Solidity does not allow the resizing of an array by directly modifying its length property. The correct way to resize an array in Solidity is to use the `push` method or to create a new array with the desired size.

In this case, the code attempts to resize the array by incrementing the `array.length` property, which is not a valid operation in Solidity and will result in a runtime error. This error will cause the transaction to revert, effectively leading to a Denial of Service as the function will not be able to complete its execution.

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the reset of the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays in line 46 and line 48, respectively. This reset occurs every time a new credit cycle starts, which is defined by the condition `lastTimeOfNewCredit + TWELVE_HOURS < block.timestamp`.

When the arrays are reset, all the previously stored creditor addresses and amounts are lost, and the contract cannot process any further transactions for those creditors. This can be exploited by an attacker who can repeatedly call the `lendGovernmentMoney` function with a small amount of ether, causing the contract to reset the arrays and effectively denying service to legitimate creditors.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by using a more robust data structure to store the creditor addresses and amounts, such as a mapping, which would not require resetting the entire data structure.",denial of service,3.0,710.0,6.0,3.2273967266082764

In this line, the contract attempts to send Ether to each address in the refundAddresses array. If any of these addresses fail to accept the Ether (for example, if they are not controlled by the sender or if they have insufficient funds), the entire refundAll function will fail due to the require statement. This can lead to a denial of service, as the function will not complete successfully, and the contract will not be able to refund the Ether to the other addresses in the array.",denial of service,3.0,665.0,6.0,2.3719494342803955

The provided smart contract code is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack based on the given snippet. The `ifillArray` function in the `DosOneFunc` contract does not have a vulnerability that would lead to a denial of service. The function simply fills an array with addresses up to a certain limit, and if the array is already full, it clears it. This operation does not inherently lead to a denial of service.

However, it's important to note that the code uses Solidity version `^0.4.2EE`, which is outdated and no longer supported. It's recommended to upgrade to a more recent version of Solidity to benefit from security improvements and bug fixes.",denial of service,1.0,661.0,6.0,2.5636935234069824
