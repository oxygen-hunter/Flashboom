11,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `createVestingContractWithFloatingPercent` function of the `TokenVestingFactory` contract. The issue is that the `createVestingContractWithFloatingPercent` function does not check if the `_beneficiary` is the owner of the `TokenVestingFactory` contract before creating a new `TokenVestingWithFloatingPercent` contract for them. This could potentially allow a non-owner to create a vesting contract for themselves or others, which could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the token distribution.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add a check to ensure that the `_beneficiary` is the owner of the `TokenVestingFactory` contract before creating a new `TokenVestingWithFloatingPercent` contract for them. Here's an example of how you can modify the `createVestingContractWithFloatingPercent` function to include this check:

```solidity

12,access control," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `TokenVestingWithFloatingPercent` contract, specifically in the `vestedAmount` function. The issue is with the calculation of `_periodPercentsIndex` and how it's used to determine the vested amount.

The problematic line is:

```solidity
uint _periodPercentsIndex = now.sub(cliff).div(vestingPeriod);
```

This line calculates the index of the period percentage array based on the current time and the cliff time. However, the calculation does not account for the possibility that the current time is exactly equal to the cliff time. In this case, the index would be zero, which would cause the loop to skip the first period percentage and potentially lead to incorrect vested amounts being calculated.

To fix this vulnerability, the calculation of `_periodPercentsIndex` should be adjusted to handle the case when the current time is equal to the cliff time. One possible solution is to use the `add` function instead of `sub` and adjust the loop condition accordingly:

```solidity
uint _periodPercentsIndex = now.add(cliff).div(vestingPeriod);

The provided code is vulnerable due to the access control mechanism using the `tx.origin` address. This can be exploited through a technique known as ""reentrancy attack"" or ""delegatecall attack.""

In the `DynamicVesting` contract, the `DynamicVesting` constructor is called with `tx.origin`. This means that any contract can call the constructor and create a new `DynamicVesting` instance with the attacker's address as the owner. The attacker can then use this instance to call the `addVesting` function, which transfers Ether to the contract and sets the attacker as the owner.

Once the attacker becomes the owner, they can call the `changeOwner` function to transfer ownership to another address, effectively stealing the funds. This vulnerability arises because the `tx.origin` address is used to check the caller's identity, and it can be manipulated by calling contracts.

To fix this vulnerability, you should replace the `tx.origin` check with a more secure access control mechanism, such as using a modifier that checks the caller's address against a whitelist or using a more secure way to verify the caller's identity.",access control,4.0,751.0,6.0,2.3133444786071777

An underflow occurs when a subtraction operation results in a negative value, which is not allowed in Solidity. This can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the contract's state and potentially drain funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the `require` statement should be updated to check if the `amount` is less than or equal to the `balances[msg.sender]` and not just greater than or equal to. The updated line should be:

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `tx.origin` for access control in the `sendTo` function of the `MyContract` contract. This is a known issue in Solidity, as `tx.origin` can be easily spoofed by a malicious actor. An attacker can create a contract that calls the `sendTo` function, and the contract will check `tx.origin` against the `owner`, which will be the attacker's address, not the actual owner's address. This allows the attacker to bypass the access control and transfer funds from the contract.

Additionally, the `TokenVestingWithFloatingPercent` contract uses the deprecated `delegatecall` function in its constructor, which can lead to vulnerabilities if not used carefully.

This line is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, where an attacker can call the `refund` function repeatedly before the balance is updated, leading to an incorrect balance being transferred.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance before calling the transfer function, like this:

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to an access control issue. The vulnerability lies in the `createVestingContractWithFloatingPercent` function of the `TokenVestingFactory` contract. This function is marked as `public`, which means it can be called by any external account or contract. However, the function itself only allows the owner of the `TokenVestingFactory` contract to create a new `TokenVestingWithFloatingPercent` contract.

The issue is that the `onlyOwner` modifier is not used in the function definition, which means that any external account or contract can call this function and create a new `TokenVestingWithFloatingPercent` contract. This can lead to unauthorized creation of vesting contracts, which can be exploited by attackers.

To fix this vulnerability, the `onlyOwner` modifier should be used in the function definition to restrict the creation of new `TokenVestingWithFloatingPercent` contracts to only the owner of the `TokenVestingFactory` contract. The corrected function definition would look like this:

The vulnerability lies in the `Command` function, where the low-level call `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);` is used. This function is similar to the `call` function mentioned in the first contract, and it suffers from the same issue. The return value of this low-level call is not checked, which can lead to fail-open and other unwanted outcomes.

In the `Command` function, if the low-level call fails, the function will continue to execute without reverting the transaction. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploitation by attackers.

To fix this vulnerability, the return value of the low-level call should be checked, and the transaction should be reverted if the call fails. This can be done by using the `require` statement to check the return value of the call and revert the transaction if it fails.

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to the same type of vulnerability as the first contract you mentioned. The vulnerability lies in the `TokenVestingWithFloatingPercent` contract, specifically in the `release` function.

The issue is that the `release` function does not check the return value of the `token.transfer` call. If the transfer fails for any reason (e.g., insufficient balance, gas price issues, or a bug in the token contract), the `release` function will not revert, and the contract will continue to execute. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add a check for the return value of the `token.transfer` call and revert the transaction if the transfer fails:

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to front running. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `play` function is public and payable, which means that users can submit transactions to the contract with higher gas fees to have their transactions processed first. Since the contract's state is public, a malicious user can see the transactions in the mempool and submit a transaction with a higher gas fee to preempt the original transaction. This can lead to the malicious user winning the game before the original user's transaction is processed, effectively stealing the winnings.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract could implement a delay or use a commit-reveal scheme to prevent users from seeing each other's transactions before they are processed.",front running,3.0,662.0,6.0,3.3464510440826416

The provided smart contract code is not vulnerable to integer overflows or underflows in the same way as the first example. The vulnerability in the first example is due to the subtraction operation on a mapping value, which could lead to an underflow if the value is zero. However, in the second example, the `TokenVestingWithFloatingPercent` contract does not perform any arithmetic operations that could lead to integer overflows or underflows. The operations are either comparisons, assignments, or calculations that are safe within the bounds of the uint256 type.",arithmetic,1.0,633.0,6.0,2.275775671005249

The vulnerability lies in the TokenVestingWithFloatingPercent contract, specifically in the vestedAmount function. In the line:

uint _periodPercentsIndex = now.sub(cliff).div(vestingPeriod);

The division operation can result in an integer overflow if the difference between now and cliff is greater than the maximum value of a uint256 type (2^256 - 1). This can lead to an incorrect index value for the periodPercents array, which may cause the function to access an out-of-bounds index, leading to potential vulnerabilities.

Additionally, the line:

uint totalPercent = 0;
for (uint i = 0; i < _periodPercentsIndex - 1; i++) {

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the TokenVestingWithFloatingPercent contract, specifically in the constructor where the sum of the percentages is calculated.

In the constructor, the following line calculates the sum of the percentages:

```solidity
uint sum = 0;
for (uint i = 0; i < _periodPercents.length; i++) {
    sum = sum.add(_periodPercents[i]);
}
```

The issue here is that the `add` function does not check for overflow. If the sum of the percentages exceeds the maximum value of a uint (2^256 - 1), it will wrap around to zero, causing the `require(sum == 100, 'percentage sum must be equal to 100');` check to fail. This can lead to incorrect behavior in the contract, such as releasing more tokens than intended.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library or the built-in SafeMath functions in Solidity 0.8.x and above, which include overflow checks. For example, you can replace the `add` function with the SafeMath `addSafe` function:

The vulnerability lies in the TokenVestingWithFloatingPercent contract, specifically in the vestedAmount() function. In the line:

uint _periodPercentsIndex = now.sub(cliff).div(vestingPeriod);

If the cliff is set to a very large number and the current time (now) is set to a smaller number, the subtraction operation could result in a negative value. When this negative value is divided by the vestingPeriod, it could lead to an integer underflow, causing the _periodPercentsIndex to become a very large positive number.

This large positive number could then be used in the following line:

if (_periodPercentsIndex > periodPercents.length.sub(1)) {

This condition could be true when it should not be, leading to the vestedAmount() function returning the totalBalance, which could be a very large number. This could result in an unexpectedly large amount of tokens being released to the beneficiary, potentially leading to a loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add a check to ensure that the _periodPercentsIndex is within the valid range of the periodPercents array.",arithmetic,3.0,764.0,6.0,2.425736427307129

The vulnerability lies in the same line as the original code:

```solidity
lockTime[msg.sender] += _secondsToIncrease;

This line is susceptible to integer overflow because the `+=` operator can cause the `lockTime` value to exceed the maximum value of a uint type (2^256 - 1). When this happens, the value wraps around to 0, which can lead to unintended consequences, such as allowing the user to withdraw funds before the intended time.",arithmetic,3.0,642.0,6.0,2.5371949672698975
82,arithmetic," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the following line:

require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);

This line checks if the value sent by the user (msg.value) is equal to the product of the number of tokens they want to buy and the price per token. If the product of numTokens and PRICE_PER_TOKEN exceeds the maximum value of a uint256, it will cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect value being assigned to msg.value. This can result in the user being able to buy more tokens than they should be able to, potentially leading to a loss of funds.

Additionally, the line:

balanceOf[msg.sender] -= numTokens;

can also be vulnerable to integer underflow. If the balanceOf[msg.sender] is less than numTokens, subtracting numTokens will result in an underflow, causing the balance to become a very large positive number. This can lead to incorrect token balances and potential loss of funds.

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the `TokenVestingWithFloatingPercent` contract, specifically in the `vestedAmount` function. The issue arises when calculating the `_periodPercentsIndex` and accessing the `periodPercents` array.

In the line:

```solidity
uint _periodPercentsIndex = now.sub(cliff).div(vestingPeriod);
```

If the `now` is less than `cliff`, the `_periodPercentsIndex` will be a negative number. When accessing the `periodPercents` array using this index, it can lead to an integer underflow, causing the index to wrap around to a large positive number. This can result in accessing an out-of-bounds index in the `periodPercents` array, leading to potential vulnerabilities.

To fix this issue, you should add a check to ensure that `_periodPercentsIndex` is always a non-negative number before using it to access the `periodPercents` array.",arithmetic,3.0,733.0,6.0,1.6174829006195068

The vulnerability lies in the `TokenVestingWithFloatingPercent` contract, specifically in the `vestedAmount` function. The issue is with the following line:

```solidity
uint _periodPercentsIndex = now.sub(cliff).div(vestingPeriod);
```

This line calculates the index of the current period based on the current time, the vesting cliff, and the vesting period. However, the division operation used here can cause an integer overflow if the result of `now.sub(cliff)` is a very large number.

Solidity uses truncating division, which means that the result of the division operation is the integer part of the quotient, and any fractional part is discarded. If the result of `now.sub(cliff)` is a very large number, the division operation can cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect index value.

This incorrect index value can then be used to access the `periodPercents` array, potentially leading to out-of-bounds array access and other unintended behavior.

This line is susceptible to integer underflow, which occurs when the sender's balance is already at 0 and the transfer amount is greater than 0. In this case, the subtraction operation would result in a negative balance, which is not allowed in the contract's `mapping(address => uint)` for balances.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin, which provides safe arithmetic operations and checks for overflow and underflow. Here's an example of how to use SafeMath in the `transfer` function:

Although the require statement `require(sum == 100, 'percentage sum must be equal to 100');` ensures that the sum of the percentages is equal to 100, it does not prevent an integer overflow from occurring during the addition process.

The `airDrop()` function modifies the state of the contract by increasing the `tokenBalance` of the `msg.sender` by 20. However, it does not perform any checks to prevent reentrancy before making this state change.

In the `attack` contract, the `supportsToken()` function can be called by an attacker, which in turn calls the `airDrop()` function of the `ModifierEntrancy` contract. Since the `airDrop()` function does not perform any checks to prevent reentrancy, an attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the `supportsToken()` function recursively, causing the `airDrop()` function to be called multiple times and potentially draining funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the `airDrop()` function should be modified to include checks to prevent reentrancy, such as using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern or using the `nonReentrant` modifier from OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard library.",reentrancy,3.0,753.0,6.0,3.126214027404785

This line allows the `msg.sender` to make a recursive call to the `Collect` function before the balance update is completed. If the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract, it can exploit this vulnerability to repeatedly withdraw funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern, where all external calls are made after updating the contract's state. In this case, the balance update should be done before making the external call. Here's an updated version of the `Collect` function:

The problematic line is:

Since miners have leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, this can lead to manipulation of the random number generation, potentially affecting the fairness of the payout process.

Additionally, the `payOut()` function uses the `now` variable, which is also derived from `block.timestamp`, to check if the random number is greater than 0 and if the difference between the current time and the random number is greater than 24 hours.

132,short addresses," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to short address attacks. The vulnerability lies in the way the contract handles addresses, particularly in the `sendCoin` function. The issue is that the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) allows for addresses to be padded with leading zeros, which can be exploited by attackers to create short addresses that are not the full 40 hexadecimal characters.

In the `sendCoin` function, the contract does not check the length of the `to` address before processing the transaction. An attacker could create a short address with fewer than 40 hexadecimal characters, and the contract would still process the transaction as if it were a valid address. This could lead to funds being sent to an unintended recipient, potentially resulting in loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should validate the length of the `to` address before processing the transaction. Here's an example of how to do this:

```solidity
function sendCoin(address to, uint amount) returns(bool sufficient) {
    require(to.length() == 20, ""Invalid address length"");

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `emptyCreditors` function, specifically in the line `creditorAddresses = new address[](0);`. This line resets the `creditorAddresses` array to an empty array when its length exceeds 1500. An attacker can repeatedly call the `addCreditors` function to fill the array and then call the `emptyCreditors` function to reset it, effectively causing the contract to consume gas and potentially leading to a DoS attack.",denial of service,3.0,639.0,6.0,2.1639325618743896
134,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles dynamic array resizing in the `insertNnumbers` function. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the contract does not properly handle the case when the array is full and needs to be resized.

The vulnerability is present in the following lines:

```solidity
for(uint i=0;i<numbers;i++) {
    if(numElements == array.length) {
        array.length += 1;
    }
    array[numElements++] = value;
}
```

When the array is full, the code attempts to increase the array's length by 1. However, this operation does not actually resize the array. Instead, it only changes the length reported by the `length` property. The actual memory allocated for the array remains the same, and the new element is not added to the array.

This can lead to a Denial of Service attack because an attacker can repeatedly call the `insertNnumbers` function with a large number of elements, causing the contract to enter an infinite loop as it continuously tries to resize the array without actually adding new elements. This can consume significant gas and potentially lead to the contract being stuck in a state where it cannot process any other transactions.

If any of the addresses fail to send the Ether (for example, due to insufficient balance or a malicious intent to not send), the `require` statement will revert the transaction, causing all subsequent transactions to fail as well. This is because Solidity transactions are atomic, meaning that if one part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is reverted.

This line attempts to send the current bid amount to the current frontrunner. If the current frontrunner's address is a contract that does not have a fallback function or a receive function, the transaction will fail, and the bid function will revert. This can be exploited by an attacker to repeatedly call the bid function with a non-contract address as the current frontrunner, causing the contract to revert and potentially exhaust the gas limit of the calling account.
