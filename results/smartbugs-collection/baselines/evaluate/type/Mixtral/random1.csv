12,access control," The given smart contract code is not the one provided in the question for auditing. However, I will evaluate the provided code for vulnerabilities.

The code consists of three contracts: Missing, SafeMath, and StandardToken. The Missing contract is the one audited in the question. The SafeMath and StandardToken contracts are libraries and are used by the Missing contract.

The Missing contract has a vulnerability in its constructor function,'missing'. The function sets the contract owner to the msg.sender, which is the address of the caller. This means that anyone can call the'missing' function and become the contract owner. Once the owner, they can call the 'withdraw' function to drain the contract of its funds.

The vulnerability is an access control issue. The 'onlyowner' modifier is used to restrict the 'withdraw' function to the contract owner. However, the'missing' function is public and does not use the 'onlyowner' modifier. This allows anyone to call the'missing' function and become the contract owner.

Therefore, the answer is 'YES' and the vulnerability is an access control issue.",access control,3.0,655.0,6.0,2.2860422134399414

Without specifically auditing the provided code, I cannot definitively say whether it is vulnerable or not. However, based on the given code, there do not appear to be any obvious vulnerabilities related to the access control or the use of the SafeMath library. The only potential issue is the use of the ""public constant"" keyword for the ""allowance"" function, which may not be necessary and could potentially be changed to ""public"" or ""external"" depending on the intended use case.

The Missing contract does not have any apparent vulnerabilities. It has proper access control through the onlyowner modifier, and the constructor sets the contract owner. The contract also has a fallback function that does not have any vulnerabilities.

The SafeMath library is a common library and does not have any vulnerabilities in this implementation.

In this example, the contract's state is not changed based on an external input. The `solve` function only checks if a given hash matches the expected hash, and if it does, it transfers ether to the caller.

Specifically, the contract checks if the current block timestamp is not equal to the previous block timestamp before transferring the contract balance to the sender.

This vulnerability is similar to the one in the previous question, where the contract relies on the current block timestamp reported by the miner. If a miner were to manipulate the timestamp, they could potentially transfer the contract balance to an attacker's address instead of the intended recipient.

Therefore, the answer is 'YES' and the vulnerability is due to the use of the current block timestamp 'now' in the constructor function of the ""Roulette"" contract.",time manipulation,3.0,663.0,6.0,3.380380392074585
131,time manipulation," YES, The vulnerability lies in the use of block.timestamp to generate random numbers. As explained in the guide, relying on block.timestamp for randomness can lead to vulnerabilities as miners have control over the timestamp. In this case, an attacker could manipulate the timestamp to increase their chances of winning the lottery.",time manipulation,3.0,493.0,6.0,2.9006736278533936
132,short addresses, The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to the short address attack mentioned in the previous question. The vulnerability described in the previous question is related to the way arguments are padded when interacting with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The given code does not exhibit this behavior as it is written in Solidity and does not involve the use of incorrectly padded arguments.,short addresses,3.0,504.0,6.0,5.742505073547363
133,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not vulnerable to denial of service attacks as described in the provided guide. The code in question is a contract named ""DosGas"" that manages a list of creditor addresses and has a function ""emptyCreditors"" that clears the list if its length exceeds 1500. However, the vulnerability described in the guide is related to a different contract named ""DosGas"" that has a function ""emptyCreditors"" that resets the contract state and sets a flag when the length of an array exceeds a certain limit. In the given code, the ""emptyCreditors"" function does not have any functionality that could be exploited to cause a denial of service attack.

Furthermore, the given code includes a library named ""SafeMath"" and a contract named ""StandardToken"" that inherits from the ""ERC20"" contract. These contracts do not have any functionality related to the vulnerability described in the guide and are not affected by it.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",denial of service,1.0,634.0,6.0,3.3976144790649414
134,denial of service," NO. The given contract code does not exhibit any obvious vulnerabilities related to denial of service attacks. The contract is using the SafeMath library to perform arithmetic operations safely, and the array resizing is done within the bounds of the for loop. However, it's important to note that this analysis is not exhaustive and other potential vulnerabilities may exist.",denial of service,1.0,501.0,6.0,2.641868829727173
135,denial of service," Based on the given code, the smart contract is not vulnerable to the denial of service attack described earlier. The vulnerability in the code you provided was the repeated initialization of the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays to empty arrays, which effectively reset the state of the contract and allowed for multiple lending actions to be performed in quick succession, potentially leading to a denial of service attack. However, the code you provided here does not contain that vulnerability.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",denial of service,1.0,537.0,6.0,3.341306686401367
136,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not the same as the one in the previous question, so I will evaluate it separately.

The code includes a contract named ""Refunder"" and a library named ""SafeMath"". The Refunder contract has a constructor that initializes an array of refund addresses and a function ""refundAll"" that sends ether to each address in the array. The SafeMath library is used to perform safe arithmetic operations.

The ERC20 contract is a standard interface for fungible tokens and the StandardToken contract is an implementation of the ERC20 interface that uses the SafeMath library.

Based on the given code, there does not appear to be any vulnerability. The Refunder contract's refundAll function uses the require statement to ensure that each send operation succeeds before moving on to the next address. The SafeMath library's sub function includes an assert statement to ensure that the second argument is less than or equal to the first argument. These checks should prevent any denial of service attacks or other vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",denial of service,1.0,643.0,6.0,2.044813632965088
137,denial of service, NO. The given contract code does not appear to be vulnerable to denial of service attacks as it does not contain any functionality that could be exploited to cause a denial of service. The contract is simply an implementation of the ERC20 standard token with an additional library for safe arithmetic operations.,denial of service,1.0,491.0,6.0,4.072567939758301
138,denial of service," The given smart contract code is not the same as the one in the previous question, so I will evaluate it separately.

The code includes a contract named ""DosAuction"" and a library named ""SafeMath"". The ""DosAuction"" contract has a function named ""bid()"" that can be called with ether as an argument. The contract also includes a mapping named ""allowed"" in a contract named ""StandardToken"" that inherits from ""ERC20"".

Based on the given code, there is no obvious vulnerability in the ""DosAuction"" contract. However, the ""StandardToken"" contract may have vulnerabilities that are not apparent from the given code alone. For example, the ""allowance()"" function is marked as ""constant"", but it modifies the ""remaining"" variable, which is not allowed in constant functions. This could potentially be a vulnerability if the contract is used in a specific way.

Therefore, the answer is:

NO (but the ""StandardToken"" contract may have vulnerabilities not apparent from the given code alone)",denial of service,1.0,639.0,6.0,3.201298236846924
