The code has several vulnerabilities:

* **Unchecked Return Values:** The `claimThrone` function returns a boolean value, but it doesn't check the return value. This can lead to unexpected behavior.
* **Low Level Function Calls:** The `claimThrone` function uses `msg.sender.send` and `wizardAddress.send` which are low-level functions. These functions don't propagate errors, so if they fail, the contract won't revert. 
* **Reentrancy Attacks:** The `claimThrone` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
* **Arithmetic Overflows and Underflows:** The code doesn't handle arithmetic overflows and underflows well. 
* **Access Control Vulnerabilities:** The `transferOwnership` function is vulnerable to access control vulnerabilities.

The `lockEtherPay` contract uses the `lock` function to lock Ether. This function calls `msg.sender.call.value(userBalance[msg.sender])()` which is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` line allows an attacker to call the `CashOut` function repeatedly, potentially draining the contract's funds.
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:**  The `if(_am<=balances[msg.sender])` condition is not sufficient to prevent reentrancy.  An attacker could call `CashOut` multiple times before the contract's internal logic completes.

The `CashOut` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `CashOut` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a potential reentrancy vulnerability. 
* **Unclear Execution:** The code doesn't specify how the `call.value(_am)` function is executed. This leaves room for an attacker to potentially execute multiple calls within the same transaction.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is an external call. This means the contract can be called again before the initial execution is complete.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The attacker can call `Collect` multiple times, potentially draining the contract's funds.
