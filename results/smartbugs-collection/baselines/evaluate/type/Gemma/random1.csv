The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is a call to an external contract.
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:**  This call to an external contract can be exploited by an attacker. The attacker can call the `Collect` function repeatedly, potentially draining the contract's funds.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **Unrestricted External Calls:** The `Collect` function allows external calls to the contract before the initial execution is complete.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

The contract has a potential denial of service vulnerability. 

Here's why:

* **Excessive Creditors:** The contract allows adding a large number of creditors (up to 350) through the `addCreditors` function. This can lead to a denial of service if the contract is targeted by an attacker who can repeatedly call this function. 
* **Empty Creditors:** The `emptyCreditors` function can be exploited to clear the `creditorAddresses` array, potentially causing the contract to become unresponsive. 
* **Unpredictable Behavior:** The `emptyCreditors` function's logic is not clear. It could be exploited to cause the contract to behave in unexpected ways.
