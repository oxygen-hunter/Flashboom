The `tokens_buy` function calls `c.call` with a `bytes4` hash representing a transfer function. This is a low-level call that doesn't propagate errors.  The `if(!c.call(bytes4(sha3(""transferFrom(address,address,uint256)"")),owner, msg.sender,tokens_buy)){` statement is vulnerable because it doesn't check the return value of the `c.call` function. If the transfer fails, the contract will continue to execute, potentially leading to a loss of funds.

The code has several vulnerabilities:

* **Unchecked Return Values:** The `claimThrone` function returns a boolean value, but it doesn't check if the return value is true or false. This can lead to unexpected behavior.
* **Low Level Function Calls:** The `msg.sender.send()` function is a low-level function that doesn't propagate errors. This can lead to unexpected behavior.
* **Unprotected Access:** The `transferOwnership` function allows anyone to change the contract's owner. This is a security vulnerability. 
* **Reentrancy Attacks:** The `claimThrone` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
* **Arithmetic Overflows and Underflows:** The code doesn't handle arithmetic overflows and underflows well. 
* **Timestamp Dependence:** The `claimThrone` function uses the block timestamp for critical functionality. This can be manipulated by miners. 
* **Lack of Error Handling:** The code lacks robust error handling, which can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled External Calls:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls an external contract (`_addr`) with the `_wei` value. This means the external contract can potentially execute arbitrary code, including calls to other functions within the contract.
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:**  The `WithdrawToHolder` function doesn't explicitly check for reentrancy. If an attacker calls `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, they could potentially execute the `_addr.call.value(_wei)()` call within the contract multiple times, draining funds.

The code relies on `block.timestamp` for the random number generation. This is vulnerable to manipulation by miners, as they can change the reported timestamp.

The code has a Denial of Service vulnerability.  The `emptyCreditors` function can be exploited to reset the contract's state and potentially cause a Denial of Service.

134,denial of service,"YES

The code has a Denial of Service vulnerability. 

Here's why:

* **Infinite Loop:** The `insertNnumbers` function has a potential for an infinite loop.  The `if` statement checks if the array length is equal to the current `numElements`. If it is, the `array.length += 1` statement is executed. This could lead to an infinite loop if the `numbers` parameter is large enough. 
* **Resource Exhaustion:** The `clear` function can cause resource exhaustion. The `clearDOS` function is designed to clear the array, but it does so by setting the array length to 0. This can lead to resource exhaustion if the array is large enough.

The code implements a function that pushes addresses into an array. This function is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack. 

The code pushes addresses into an array, and if the array length is less than 1500, it pushes 350 addresses to the array. This can lead to a Denial of Service attack.
