The vulnerability lies in line 23, where the `require` statement is used to ensure that the `currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid)` function call succeeds. However, if the call fails, the entire transaction reverts, which means that the frontrunner who is outbid will win the auction. This is a type of DoS attack known as a ""frontrunning attack,"" where an attacker exploits the fact that the contract's `send` function can be called multiple times in a single transaction to drain the contract of funds.",denial of service,4.0,562.0,6.0,3.299018621444702
