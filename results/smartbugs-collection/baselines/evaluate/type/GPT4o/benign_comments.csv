- **Unchecked Call Return Value:** The return value of `_dst.call` is not being checked. If the call fails (returns `false`), the execution will continue, potentially causing unintended outcomes or leaving the contract in an inconsistent state. 
- **Fail-Open Behavior:** Since Solidity doesn’t automatically revert on failed low-level calls, this could allow an attacker to exploit the contract by manipulating `_dst` and `_data` to perform malicious actions or drain funds without reverting the transaction.

The code should handle the return value of `_dst.call` like this:

In Solidity version ^0.4.19, arithmetic operations do not automatically check for overflows. If a large enough value is passed as `input`, the value of `count` could wrap around and result in an incorrect, smaller value, leading to potential vulnerabilities like unauthorized fund manipulation or denial of service.",arithmetic,3.0,529.0,6.0,1.2156777381896973

The vulnerability exists because the contract uses Solidity version 0.4.15, which does not include built-in overflow and underflow protection. Specifically, in the line:  
```solidity
sellerBalance += value;
```
If `sellerBalance` and `value` are large enough, their sum could exceed the maximum value for `uint` (2^256 - 1), causing an overflow and setting `sellerBalance` to an incorrect value (wrapping around to 0).",arithmetic,3.0,540.0,6.0,1.107337236404419

The contract is vulnerable to an integer overflow on the line: `balanceOf[_to] += _value;`. In Solidity versions below 0.8.0, arithmetic operations do not have built-in overflow or underflow checks. This means that if the value of `balanceOf[_to]` is close to the maximum limit of `uint256`, adding `_value` could cause an overflow, resetting the value to a lower number. This vulnerability could be exploited to manipulate balances.",arithmetic,3.0,539.0,6.0,1.1344778537750244

The vulnerability lies in the use of `blockhash(guesses[msg.sender].block)` to generate randomness.

This contract is **vulnerable** due to its use of **insecure randomness**. Specifically:

1. **Line 99:** `address seed1 = contestants[uint(block.coinbase) % totalTickets].addr;`

2. **Line 101:** `address seed2 = contestants[uint(msg.sender) % totalTickets].addr;`  
   - **msg.sender** (the caller) can be directly controlled by the attacker, making it predictable and exploitable.

3. **Line 103:** `uint seed3 = block.difficulty;`  
   - **block.difficulty** is another miner-influenced value, which makes it unreliable for randomness.

The smart contract is vulnerable due to the use of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `Collect` function. This low-level call does not provide a gas limit and allows an external contract to execute code, which can potentially reenter the `Collect` function and drain funds before the balance is updated.

The smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `airDrop()` function, which calls the `supportsToken` modifier. The `supportsToken` modifier checks if the `msg.sender` is an address that supports the token by calling the external `supportsToken()` function in another contract, potentially an untrusted contract.

In the provided code, the `attack` contract overrides the `supportsToken()` function to recursively call the `airDrop()` function. This allows the attack contract to bypass the `hasNoBalance` check and execute `airDrop()` multiple times, incrementing the `tokenBalance` repeatedly before the original execution completes.",reentrancy,3.0,578.0,6.0,1.1334879398345947

132,short addresses,"YES

The code is vulnerable to a **short address attack**. This vulnerability occurs because the `sendCoin` function does not perform proper validation on the input parameters. Specifically, in older Solidity versions (like `^0.4.11`), the EVM does not enforce strict length checks on input data. If a crafted transaction with a truncated address is sent, the EVM may assume that the missing bytes belong to the subsequent parameter (`amount`). This can result in incorrect values being processed, causing an unintended transfer or state change.

Additionally, this is not directly an EVM bug but rather a mismatch between how Solidity handles inputs and how clients encode transactions. Hence, such vulnerabilities should be mitigated in the smart contract by using more recent Solidity versions or libraries like `SafeMath` and enforcing stricter input validations.",short addresses,3.0,606.0,6.0,1.1156036853790283

134,denial of service,"YES

The smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to excessive gas consumption. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the `insertNnumbers` function. 

### Explanation:
The `for` loop in the `insertNnumbers` function (lines 18-22) allows users to insert a potentially large number of elements into the `array`, which can cause the function to consume an excessive amount of gas, especially if `numbers` is a high value. Since Ethereum has a block gas limit, a high `numbers` value can lead to the transaction running out of gas, causing a denial of service (DoS) because the function will fail, and no further transactions can be processed.

Additionally, increasing the length of the array dynamically using `array.length += 1;` (line 20) inside the loop can also lead to high gas consumption, making it easier for this function to exceed the block gas limit.

Therefore, a malicious user can use this function to execute a DoS attack by submitting a transaction that intentionally fails due to high gas consumption, preventing other users from interacting with the contract.",denial of service,3.0,668.0,6.0,1.0866644382476807

The contract is vulnerable to a denial of service attack because if one of the addresses in `refundAddresses` fails to receive a refund (due to issues like running out of gas), the entire `refundAll` function will revert, preventing refunds to all other addresses.

The contract is still vulnerable due to the potential for gas limit exhaustion in the `for` loop, which could lead to a denial of service.

138,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability in the given smart contract lies in the use of `currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid)`. The `.send()` function forwards 2,300 gas, which may not be sufficient if the recipient (the previous frontrunner) executes a fallback function that requires more gas. If the send operation fails, it causes the entire `bid()` function to revert, preventing new bids from being placed. This results in a **denial of service** since the current frontrunner could block the auction by preventing any other participants from successfully submitting bids.",denial of service,3.0,556.0,6.0,1.1719110012054443
