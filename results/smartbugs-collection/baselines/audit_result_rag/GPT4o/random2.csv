The `lock()` function in the `lockEtherPay` contract is vulnerable due to an **Access Control** issue. Specifically, it allows the `onlyOwner` modifier to control the `lock()` function, but the `Ownable` contract is not defined or inherited in the provided code. Without a properly defined or inherited `Ownable` contract, access control is ineffective, making it susceptible to unauthorized calls.",1368,85,5.9037511348724365
12,access control,"YES. 

The vulnerability lies in the fact that there is an **access control issue** in the `lockEtherPay` contract. The `tokenBalance` function is public, meaning anyone can access it and check the contract's token balance. The more critical problem is with the **`lock` function**: although it uses the `onlyOwner` modifier, it doesn't account for scenarios where ownership might be transferred insecurely, leading to potential ownership exploits. This makes it vulnerable to access control issues. Additionally, `isLocked` and other state-changing logic are insufficiently guarded, which may be manipulated by a malicious owner or during ownership transitions.",1106,130,7.296043157577515
13,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the fact that **anyone can call the `DynamicPyramid()` function** (the constructor is incorrectly named due to an older Solidity version). This function sets the `creator` to the sender of the transaction, which means that any user can reset the ownership of the contract. Thus, the contract is vulnerable to an access control issue where the attacker can take over as the contract owner.",3026,84,7.219459295272827
14,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);
```

This logic is flawed because it incorrectly checks the withdrawal amount. It should require that the balance is **greater than or equal** to the amount being withdrawn, but the condition is reversed. This introduces an access control issue where users can withdraw more than their actual balance, leading to potential fund draining.

",1223,89,7.296470642089844
15,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `IamMissing()` function, which is publicly accessible and allows anyone to set the contract's `owner` variable to themselves. This bypasses the intended access control, enabling any attacker to take control of the contract and withdraw its funds.",1116,54,5.175371170043945
16,access control,"**YES**

The contract is vulnerable due to **access control issues**. The `lock` function in the `lockEtherPay` contract lacks proper authorization checks. While it uses `onlyOwner`, which is presumably part of the `Ownable` contract, there is no code provided for the `Ownable` contract in this snippet, making it unclear if `onlyOwner` is properly implemented. This could potentially expose the contract to unauthorized access if `onlyOwner` is not correctly securing the owner address or if the ownership mechanism is flawed. Additionally, there is no check ensuring that the `token_reward` contract is properly initialized.",1181,127,7.60497260093689
17,access control,"YES. The vulnerability is still present in the `Proxy` contract, specifically in the use of `callee.delegatecall(_data)`. Using `delegatecall` without restricting access allows any external address to execute arbitrary code within the context of the `Proxy` contract, potentially compromising the contract's state and ownership. There is no proper access control to ensure that only the owner can trigger the `forward` function, making the contract vulnerable to malicious actors.",1084,90,7.885132312774658
18,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper access control in the `PushBonusCode`, `PopBonusCode`, and `UpdateBonusCodeAt` functions. These functions are marked as public, allowing any external address to call them, which can lead to unauthorized modification of the `bonusCodes` array. Specifically:

1. **PushBonusCode**: Anyone can add arbitrary bonus codes to the array.
2. **PopBonusCode**: Anyone can remove elements from the array.
3. **UpdateBonusCodeAt**: Anyone can modify existing bonus codes at any index.

Additionally, in the `PopBonusCode` function, there is a logical issue in the condition `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length);`—this condition is always true, rendering the check ineffective.

To prevent unauthorized access, these functions should include access control checks, ensuring that only the owner (or an authorized user) can modify the `bonusCodes` array.",1277,196,13.10496711730957
19,access control,"YES.

The vulnerability lies in the function `Constructor()`. In Solidity versions before 0.5.0, constructors should not have a name; instead, they should use the `constructor` keyword. The function `Constructor()` in the given code is not recognized as a constructor and will instead be treated as a regular public function, allowing anyone to call it and change the contract's owner, bypassing the intended access control.",1106,86,7.743518352508545
20,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `initWallet()` function, where the `creator` is set by any caller due to its `public` visibility. This allows any user to call `initWallet()` and set themselves as the `creator`, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive functions like `migrateTo()`. Hence, the contract is vulnerable to access control issues.",1241,76,6.987055540084839
21,access control,"**YES**

The vulnerability exists because the contract uses `tx.origin` for access control, similar to the first contract. Specifically, in the first contract's `sendTo` function, it checks `tx.origin == owner` to validate the sender. This is dangerous because `tx.origin` can be manipulated in the context of a transaction chain involving multiple contracts. An attacker can use a contract they control to initiate a transaction that tricks the `tx.origin` check, thereby gaining unauthorized access to the function.

While the second contract includes additional logic and the use of SafeMath, it still inherits the same vulnerability due to improper access control via `tx.origin`. Therefore, the use of `tx.origin` in access control is unsafe.",1073,146,9.247132778167725
22,access control,"YES

The contract is vulnerable due to insufficient access control on the `refund()` function. Any user can call the `refund()` function and transfer the entire balance associated with their account, potentially draining funds improperly without proper authorization checks.",1261,46,6.883403539657593
23,access control,"**YES**  

The vulnerability in the `lockEtherPay` contract arises from the lack of proper access control. Although the `lock` function is protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, there is no check ensuring that the `token_reward` contract's `balanceOf` function or the `tokenBalance` function is secure. If the `token` contract is untrusted or vulnerable, attackers can potentially manipulate the token balance or the interaction between contracts, leading to unexpected behavior. 

Additionally, there's no check for handling the self-destruction of the contract or any safeguard against the vulnerabilities present in the `SimpleSuicide` contract, which could lead to an exploitation path.",1032,137,7.675577878952026
24,access control,"**YES**. The vulnerability exists in the `changeOwner` function of the `Unprotected` contract.

This is a classic access control vulnerability.",1113,63,6.02898907661438
25,access control,"YES. The vulnerability in the `Phishable` contract is due to the use of `tx.origin` for access control in the `withdrawAll` function. This is insecure because `tx.origin` can be exploited in phishing attacks, where an attacker could trick the contract owner into executing a transaction through a malicious contract. As a result, the funds could be drained by an attacker without the owner's knowledge.",1091,81,6.377891302108765
26,access control,"YES

The contract is vulnerable because it still uses `delegatecall` in an insecure manner on lines 31 and 38 in the `FibonacciBalance` contract. This can lead to access control issues, as `delegatecall` can execute code in the context of the calling contract (here, `FibonacciBalance`), potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate the contract’s state or execute malicious code. There are no restrictions or checks on the input data passed to `delegatecall`, which makes it prone to access control and other security risks.",1507,109,8.06068205833435
27,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The contract is vulnerable due to the unchecked low-level call at line 44: `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);`. This is a classic case of an unchecked low-level call where the return value is not checked. If the call fails, the transaction will not revert, leading to potential vulnerabilities such as loss of funds or unexpected behavior. This could be exploited by malicious actors if the called contract behaves in an unexpected way or if the call fails without the contract handling the error properly.",1488,100,8.177301168441772

The contract is vulnerable due to the unchecked use of low-level functions `send()` and `call()`. Specifically:

1. In the `tokens_buy()` function, the `owner2.send(sum2);` on line 54 is vulnerable because `send()` can fail, and the return value is not checked.
2. Similarly, in the `withdraw()` function, the `owner.send(balance);` on line 65 is vulnerable because, again, `send()` can fail, and the return value is not checked.

If this return value is not checked, it can lead to unintended behavior, such as failing to perform the intended operation without reverting the transaction. This can potentially cause fail-open conditions or other issues.

- Line 132: `currentMonarch.etherAddress.send(compensation);`
- Line 174: `wizardAddress.send(amount);`

As explained before, `send()` returns a boolean and does not revert on failure. Since the return values are not checked, these could fail silently, leading to potential security risks such as loss of funds or unhandled edge cases like insufficient gas for `send()` to succeed.

73,front running,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability stems from the possibility of front-running attacks, especially in the `claimReward` function. Here's why:

In the `claimReward` function, the process is susceptible to front-running because:
1. A user can submit a valid `submission` to claim the reward.
2. Another user (or even a miner) can observe the pending transaction, copy it, and submit the same transaction with a higher gas fee, thereby preempting the original user's transaction and claiming the reward instead.

This is a classic front-running vulnerability, where the visibility of pending transactions on the public Ethereum blockchain can be exploited, allowing malicious actors to manipulate the order in which transactions are processed.",1221,144,9.68235468864441
74,front running,"YES, the second smart contract is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability stems from the `solve(string solution)` function in the `FindThisHash` contract. Even though the code includes a `SafeMath` library and other functionalities (like the `lockEtherPay` contract), the core issue from the first contract remains: **front-running**. The solution can still be observed in pending transactions, allowing a malicious actor to copy the correct solution and send a transaction with a higher gas fee to win the reward before the original sender. 

Thus, the vulnerability persists in the second contract, specifically in line:
