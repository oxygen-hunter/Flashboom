12,access control,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable because the function `benign_missing` is intended to be a constructor but is incorrectly named. In Solidity version 0.4.24, constructors must have the same name as the contract (`Missing`).

13,access control,"YES

The contract is vulnerable because the constructor function is named `benign_DynamicPyramid()` instead of the contract name `Rubixi`. Since Solidity versions before 0.5.0 did not enforce constructor naming conventions strictly, this mistake allows any user to call `benign_DynamicPyramid()` and set themselves as the contract owner (creator).

The smart contract is vulnerable due to an incorrect constructor name. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, the constructor function must have the same name as the contract. In this case, the intended constructor function is incorrectly named `benign_IamMissing` instead of `Missing`. As a result, this function is treated as a regular public function, allowing anyone to call it and take ownership of the contract after deployment.

17,access control,"**YES**

The vulnerability lies in the use of `delegatecall` without proper access control mechanisms. The `benign_forward` function allows anyone to call `delegatecall` to an arbitrary `callee` address with arbitrary `_data`, potentially giving control of the contract's state to untrusted addresses. This lack of restriction can lead to malicious contracts being executed, enabling attackers to exploit the contract by modifying its state or performing unauthorized actions.

19,access control,"YES. It is vulnerable because the function `benign_Constructor` is supposed to be the constructor, but due to Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, constructors must have the same name as the contract itself.

The vulnerability lies in the function `benign_initWallet`. This function allows **anyone** to become the creator because it is a public function that can be called by any address.

This smart contract is vulnerable due to the `benign_refund()` function, which transfers the balance to the `msg.sender` without setting the user's balance to 0 afterward. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call `benign_refund()` and drain the contract’s funds, as the balance is never updated to reflect the withdrawal.

23,access control,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable due to improper access control. The function `benign_sudicideAnyone()` allows any user to call it, triggering the `selfdestruct` function, which sends all contract funds to the caller (`msg.sender`). This can lead to unauthorized users destroying the contract and receiving all of its funds. Proper access control mechanisms, such as restricting function access to the contract owner, are missing, making this contract vulnerable to exploitation.",903,92,7.280292749404907
24,access control,"YES. The `benign_changeOwner` function is vulnerable because it allows any external address to change the owner of the contract without any access control restrictions.

25,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.  

The vulnerability lies in the use of `tx.origin` for access control in the `benign_withdrawAll` function. Using `tx.origin` is insecure because it can be exploited by a phishing attack. If the owner interacts with a malicious contract, that contract could trigger this function, making `tx.origin` still point to the owner, thereby allowing the malicious contract to drain the funds.",943,87,7.254311800003052
26,access control,"YES.

The contract is vulnerable due to improper access control in two places:

1. **Line 31:**
   The contract uses `delegatecall` to execute the function from an external contract (`fibonacciLibrary`). Since `delegatecall` executes in the context of the calling contract, it inherits the storage of the calling contract, including its state variables and permissions. If the external contract (`fibonacciLibrary`) is compromised or manipulated, attackers can gain control over critical functions like `withdraw` and execute arbitrary code. 

2. **Line 38:**
   The fallback function uses `delegatecall` to pass any arbitrary data (`msg.data`) to the external `fibonacciLibrary`. This allows an attacker to craft malicious input and invoke unauthorized functions, potentially bypassing access control and manipulating the contract's behavior.

In both cases, reckless use of `delegatecall` leads to access control vulnerabilities.",1487,181,12.890632390975952

If the `call` fails (e.g., if the recipient contract rejects the transaction or runs out of gas), the funds remain in the contract, but the balance of the sender is set to 0 regardless, which can lead to the loss of funds. 

Proper error handling would involve checking the return value of the `call` to ensure that the transaction was successful before resetting the sender's balance.",1017,136,9.18795919418335
69,unchecked low level calls,"**YES**

The vulnerability lies in the unchecked low-level call at line 29: `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);`. In Solidity, the low-level `call()` does not propagate errors if it fails; instead, it returns a boolean indicating success or failure. However, in this case, the return value is not checked, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the call fails. This is a potential security risk because if the external contract called at `adr` fails, the transaction will not revert, and the contract may continue executing, potentially leading to issues like loss of funds or unintended states.",1095,122,8.649222373962402
70,unchecked low level calls,"YES. The vulnerability exists because the return value of the low-level call function (`caddress.call(id, from, _tos[i], v[i])`) is not checked.

71,unchecked low level calls,"**YES** 

The smart contract is vulnerable because it uses the low-level `call()` function at line 33 without checking the return value. The use of `_target.call.value(_value)()` can result in a failure without reverting the transaction, leaving the contract unaware of the failure. This unchecked low-level call can lead to unexpected outcomes, such as loss of funds or improper contract behavior, if the call fails.",1075,84,7.443164348602295
72,unchecked low level calls,"**YES**  
The vulnerability lies in line 14:  
`target.call.value(msg.value)(data);` uses a low-level call without checking the return value. This can lead to an unchecked failure because, unlike standard Solidity function calls, low-level calls like `call()` return a boolean value indicating success or failure. If the return value is not checked, it can result in the contract continuing execution even if the call failed, which could lead to unintended behavior or security risks. Therefore, it is vulnerable due to unchecked low-level calls.",1248,109,6.461991310119629
73,front running,"YES

It is vulnerable because the contract allows for front-running attacks in two places: 
1. In the `benign_setReward` function (line 23) where `owner.transfer(reward)` is called before updating the reward with `reward = msg.value`. This sequence exposes the contract to front-running, as an attacker could observe the pending transaction and manipulate their own transaction to preemptively claim the reward.
  
2. In the `benign_claimReward` function (line 31), where `msg.sender.transfer(reward)` is called before marking the reward as claimed (`claimed = true`). An attacker could front-run the transaction, claim the reward, and prevent the legitimate user from receiving it.",1096,143,10.128089189529419
74,front running,"YES

The vulnerability exists because the solution to the hash is provided publicly in the transaction when calling the `benign_solve` function. Malicious users can observe the transaction and submit the same solution with higher gas fees to front-run the original sender, causing the legitimate solver to lose their reward. This type of vulnerability is known as a front-running attack. The vulnerability lies in line 17: `require(hash == sha3(solution));`.",1038,89,5.586289405822754
75,front running,"YES

The vulnerability exists due to the way the `approve` function is implemented. A front-running attack can occur when a user sends a transaction to change an allowance, and a malicious actor preempts this by executing another transaction with higher gas fees. Specifically, in lines 110 and 113, the function sets the allowance directly, which could be exploited in a transaction ordering attack where the spender can use the old allowance before the new one is applied.",2364,91,5.680224180221558
76,front running,"**YES**  
The smart contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks. The vulnerability lies in lines 25 and 28, similar to the original contract. Specifically:

- In line 25, the `benign_play` function allows players to submit their number, but this transaction can be observed on the blockchain before it is mined. 
- In line 28, the second player can observe the first player's submitted number and submit a transaction with a higher gas fee, allowing them to potentially influence the outcome of the game by knowing the first player's number. 

This opens the contract to front-running, where a malicious player can manipulate the timing of transactions to gain an advantage.",1320,135,8.650451183319092
77,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because the line `map[k] -= v;` can cause an arithmetic underflow when `v` is larger than `map[k]`.

The issue arises because `count` is an unsigned integer (`uint`), initialized to `1`. When the `benign_run` function subtracts a large `input` value from `count`, it can result in an underflow, wrapping around to a very large number due to the lack of overflow/underflow protection in Solidity versions prior to 0.8.

84,arithmetic,"YES

It is vulnerable because the subtraction operation (`count - input`) on unsigned integers can cause an underflow when `input` is greater than `count`.

The contract is vulnerable due to the same arithmetic issue: in line 20, the expression `balances[msg.sender] - _value` can cause an underflow if `_value` exceeds `balances[msg.sender]`. Additionally, in line 22, the direct subtraction without safety checks can also lead to an underflow. This vulnerability can result in incorrect balances and potential exploitation.",1072,77,12.533565759658813

The contract is vulnerable to an **integer overflow**. In Solidity version 0.4.19, arithmetic operations on unsigned integers (like `uint`) do not automatically check for overflow conditions. This means if the `input` is large enough, adding it to the `count` variable could cause the value to wrap around to a smaller number, leading to unintended behavior.  

For example:  
If `count` is near the maximum value of `uint256` (2²⁵⁶ - 1) and a sufficiently large `input` is passed to `benign_run()`, the addition will overflow, resulting in an incorrect value stored in `count`.

The contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack at line 40 where the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` is used. This allows an external contract to recursively call back into the `benign_CashOut` function before the contract's state (the balance deduction) is updated. An attacker can exploit this by repeatedly withdrawing funds, draining the contract.",1407,77,5.815242052078247
123,reentrancy,"**YES**, the smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` at line 29, which allows external calls without updating the contract’s state beforehand. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the `benign_Collect` function and drain the contract’s funds before the balance is updated.",1505,75,6.60594630241394
124,reentrancy,"YES

The vulnerability is caused by the same reentrancy issue found in the original contract. Specifically, in line 38, the function `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` allows an external call to the attacker’s contract before the state of the contract is updated (i.e., before the balance is reduced). This can allow the attacker to repeatedly call the `benign_CashOut` function and drain funds before their balance is correctly adjusted, leading to the reentrancy attack.",1393,99,7.210313081741333
125,reentrancy,"YES

It is vulnerable because the code allows for a reentrancy attack in the function `benign_Collect` at line 54 where the low-level call `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` is used before the contract's state is updated. This opens up the possibility for an attacker to repeatedly call the `benign_Collect` function, draining the contract's funds before the balance is deducted.",1548,83,7.157415866851807
126,reentrancy,"YES, it is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability lies in line 17 where the contract uses `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""")`. At this point, the caller's code is executed, allowing the caller to re-enter the `benign_withdrawBalance` function before the `userBalances[msg.sender]` is set to zero. This allows the attacker to repeatedly withdraw funds, draining the contract of its balance. The state update should occur before making the external call to prevent reentrancy attacks.",1030,102,7.255353212356567
127,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. It relies on `block.timestamp` in the `benign_isSaleFinished` function, which can be manipulated by miners. Since miners have control over setting the block timestamp within a certain range, they could potentially manipulate the sale's end time, leading to timing-related vulnerabilities.",932,63,4.88239598274231
128,time manipulation,"YES. 

The contract is vulnerable to **time manipulation** for the following reasons:

1. **Line 13**:  
   ```solidity
   if (rand > 0 && now - rand > 24 hours) {
   ```
   The use of `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) introduces a vulnerability. Miners have some control over the block timestamp and can manipulate it within a certain range to exploit this condition. They could influence whether the condition evaluates as true or false, potentially controlling the payout logic.

2. **Line 27**:  
   ```solidity
   return block.timestamp;
   ```
   Using `block.timestamp` as a random number generator is insecure because miners can adjust the timestamp to influence the result. This compromises the integrity of randomness, making the contract exploitable for predictable outcomes.",1170,169,8.681337356567383
129,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the reliance on `block.timestamp` at line 27, similar to the previous contract. Miners can manipulate the timestamp to influence the contract's behavior, such as triggering or delaying the `resetInvestment` function, which is dependent on time conditions. This makes the contract vulnerable to time manipulation attacks.",1331,66,5.613732576370239
130,time manipulation,"YES

The contract is vulnerable to time manipulation because it relies on the `now` (or `block.timestamp`) function, which can be influenced by miners within a limited range. In lines 18 and 20, the `now` function is used to ensure only one transaction per block and to check if the current time is divisible by 15, respectively. Miners could manipulate the block timestamp to meet these conditions, potentially allowing them to win the balance of the contract by strategically choosing the block time that makes `now % 15 == 0`. This creates a vulnerability in the betting logic.",1054,121,7.7791829109191895
131,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because it uses `block.timestamp` (line 43) to generate a random value. Since miners have the ability to manipulate the block timestamp slightly, this can be exploited to predict the outcome of the random number generation, leading to a potential manipulation of the lottery result.",1313,61,13.363176584243774
132,short addresses,"YES

It is vulnerable to a short address attack. The vulnerability lies in the fact that Solidity does not enforce strict length checks on address inputs, and this contract does not have additional checks in place to handle potentially malformed addresses. Specifically, when a transaction is sent with a shorter-than-expected address, the EVM will pad the missing bytes, causing misalignment in the encoding of subsequent arguments, which could lead to incorrect processing of the `amount` parameter in the `benign_sendCoin` function.",1175,101,7.683221101760864
133,denial of service,"**YES**

The smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability occurs due to the potential for **gas limit exhaustion**. Specifically:

- **Line 16**: `if(creditorAddresses.length > 1500)` checks whether the number of creditors exceeds 1500.
- **Line 17**: If the condition is met, the contract attempts to reset the `creditorAddresses` array with `creditorAddresses = new address ;`.
- **Line 18**: The `win` variable is set to `true`.

When the contract tries to empty a large array of creditors (especially if the array grows beyond a certain size), the operation could exceed the gas limit and fail, effectively making the `benign_emptyCreditors()` function unusable. This would prevent further execution, creating a DoS scenario where the contract becomes stuck and cannot remove creditors, thus breaking its functionality.",1151,190,11.115121603012085
134,denial of service,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable to a **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack due to excessive gas consumption in the `benign_insertNnumbers` function. 

Specifically, the vulnerability occurs because the `for` loop dynamically increases the array size during each iteration (`array.length += 1`), leading to progressively higher gas costs as the number of elements increases. This can cause transactions to run out of gas if a large enough `numbers` value is passed, effectively causing a DoS scenario where the function becomes unusable due to gas limits.",1289,114,8.337531328201294
135,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the resetting of the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays at lines 46 and 48, respectively. If there are a large number of creditors, resetting these arrays can consume a significant amount of gas, potentially exceeding the block gas limit and causing the transaction to fail. This effectively results in a denial of service, as the contract becomes unusable if it cannot reset these arrays due to high gas costs.",2553,98,18.494773864746094
136,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of the `send` function in combination with a `require` statement in the `benign_refundAll` function. If any of the addresses in the `refundAddresses` array has a fallback function that consumes more than 2300 gas or reverts, the `send` function will fail. Because the `require` statement checks for a successful send and reverts the entire transaction if the send fails, a single address causing a failure can prevent all subsequent refunds, resulting in a denial of service for the entire refund process. This means that a single misbehaving or malicious address can effectively block refunds to all other addresses in the list.",1177,144,7.7415125370025635
137,denial of service,"**YES**  
The smart contract is vulnerable to a **denial of service** (DoS) attack due to the following reasons:

- The **for loop** in line 17 and line 18 iterates 350 times, pushing addresses into the `listAddresses` array.
- As the array grows larger, the gas required to execute this operation increases.
- Once the array's size approaches the block gas limit, the function `benign_ifillArray()` may fail to execute due to excessive gas consumption, leading to a situation where users can no longer interact with the contract, effectively causing a denial of service.",1023,126,10.638060092926025
138,denial of service,"YES. It is vulnerable because the contract depends on the successful execution of `currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid)` to refund the previous frontrunner. If the frontrunner's fallback function is designed to always fail (e.g., by reverting), the refund will fail, causing the entire transaction to revert and preventing others from placing higher bids, effectively creating a denial of service (DoS) condition.",1073,83,6.6510844230651855
