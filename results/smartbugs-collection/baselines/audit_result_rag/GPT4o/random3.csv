The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function. It allows any existing owner to assign ownership to any address, including themselves or a malicious party, without requiring authorization from the root or a majority of owners. This opens the contract to unauthorized access if a rogue owner assigns control to an attacker.",1210,61,5.385624170303345
12,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the **constructor function**. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, the function name matching the contract name is treated as the constructor. However, if this is not recognized as a constructor (due to capitalization or typo issues), it becomes a **public function** that anyone can call. 

In this code, the `missing()` function is intended to act as the constructor, but because of Solidity’s quirks in versions like 0.4.24, it remains a **public function** that can be invoked repeatedly by anyone. This allows any malicious actor to reassign the `owner` to their address, bypassing the intended access control. As a result, the attacker can take control of the contract and withdraw its balance, violating the access control mechanism.",949,169,9.474114179611206
13,access control,"YES

The contract is vulnerable due to the same access control issue as in the first version. The constructor function `DynamicPyramid()` is not properly defined using the keyword `constructor` (introduced in Solidity 0.4.22). As a result, it can be called by anyone, which allows any user to set themselves as the `creator`. This compromises the ownership control, enabling unauthorized users to perform privileged actions such as collecting fees and changing key contract parameters.",2869,94,9.080638647079468
14,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function, where the `require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);` condition is incorrect. It should be `require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);` to ensure that users cannot withdraw more than their balance. This is an access control issue, as it incorrectly validates the withdrawal amount, potentially allowing users to withdraw an invalid amount.",1065,79,6.739121913909912
15,access control,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `IamMissing` function, which allows anyone to call it and reset the owner of the contract to their own address. Since this function is public and lacks proper access control, it can be exploited by any external user, effectively giving them control over the contract.

16,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper access control in the `set` function, allowing any user to modify the `map` array without restrictions. This could enable malicious actors to manipulate the contract's internal state. Furthermore, the contract's access control issue still persists in the `withdraw` function, where only the `owner` is supposed to withdraw funds, but the contract does not include robust mechanisms to protect against other access control bypass techniques.",1023,91,5.3592565059661865
17,access control,"YES. The vulnerability in the second contract still exists because the `forward` function uses `delegatecall` without proper access control, allowing anyone to invoke it and potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the `Proxy` contract. This can lead to a serious access control issue where malicious users could exploit the contract, similar to the first contract. The `delegatecall` function executes the code of the callee in the context of the caller, meaning it inherits the caller's storage, potentially allowing manipulation of the contract's state.",926,106,7.82195258140564
18,access control,"YES. The contract is vulnerable due to a lack of access control on several public functions, specifically `PushBonusCode`, `PopBonusCode`, and `UpdateBonusCodeAt`.

There is no restriction on who can call these functions, which can lead to unauthorized access and misuse of the contract’s functionality.",1119,86,6.348020315170288
19,access control,"YES. 

The vulnerability is due to the incorrect naming of the constructor function. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, the constructor function must have the same name as the contract. In this case, the constructor is incorrectly named `Constructor()` instead of `Missing()`, making it a regular public function rather than a constructor.

24,access control,"**YES**  
The vulnerability is present because the `changeOwner` function does not have any access control implemented. This function allows anyone to change the owner of the contract without restriction, which is an access control flaw. Since the `changeOwner` function is public and not protected by the `onlyowner` modifier, any external user can call it and take ownership of the contract. This is the same issue highlighted in the previous code, making the contract vulnerable.",955,93,7.417104244232178
25,access control,"YES, it is vulnerable because it still uses `require(tx.origin == owner)` to validate the caller, which is prone to an access control vulnerability.

26,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability arises from the use of `delegatecall` in lines 31 and 38. Specifically:

1. **Line 31**: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(fibSig, withdrawalCounter));` 
   - The use of `delegatecall` allows the `FibonacciBalance` contract to execute code from the `FibonacciLib` library, but in the context of the `FibonacciBalance` contract's storage. This means that the `fibonacciLibrary` can manipulate the storage of `FibonacciBalance`. Since `delegatecall` executes in the caller's context, if the `fibonacciLibrary` is untrusted or malicious, it could modify critical variables like `calculatedFibNumber`, potentially allowing unauthorized withdrawals.

2. **Line 38**: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(msg.data));`
   - The fallback function allows any arbitrary call to be passed through via `msg.data` to `fibonacciLibrary` using `delegatecall`. This is highly dangerous because any function from the `fibonacciLibrary` can be executed in the context of `FibonacciBalance` without proper restrictions. Attackers could craft malicious inputs and execute unintended functions, leading to potential theft or denial-of-service attacks.

Both cases showcase critical **access control** vulnerabilities through the unsafe use of `delegatecall`.",1350,274,16.01835608482361

The vulnerability arises from the same lines as before:

- **Line 23**: `owner.transfer(reward);`
- **Line 31**: `msg.sender.transfer(reward);`

These lines make the contract vulnerable to front-running attacks, as a malicious user can observe a legitimate user's transaction to claim the reward, copy it, and execute their own transaction with a higher gas fee to steal the reward before the legitimate transaction is processed. The contract does not implement any protection against such ordering attacks.",1063,108,8.403861999511719
74,front running,"**YES**, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability persists because the contract still uses `require(hash == sha3(solution));` (in line 20). This allows a front-running attack where a malicious user can observe a pending transaction with the correct solution and submit a copy of the transaction with a higher gas fee to steal the reward before the original transaction is confirmed.

The presence of `allowed` mappings does not mitigate the vulnerability; they are unrelated to the primary issue of front-running in the `solve` function.",1009,102,9.092723846435547

The vulnerability is present because the `approve` function allows a potential front-running attack. A malicious user can observe a pending transaction that approves a certain amount for a spender and submit a higher-fee transaction to exploit the `approve` function by front-running it. This allows the attacker to act on the approval before the original transaction is mined, potentially leading to a race condition where the wrong amount of tokens is approved. 

The issue is the same as in the first contract, where the function:
```solidity

1. **Line 15**: `if ( rand> 0 && now - rand > 24 hours ) {` — The contract relies on `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`), which is manipulable by miners. This timestamp manipulation can affect the contract's logic for paying out.

2. **Line 29**: `return block.timestamp;` — `block.timestamp` is used to generate random numbers, which makes it susceptible to miner manipulation and results in poor randomness generation.",1130,120,7.777615308761597
129,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability in the contract lies in its reliance on `block.timestamp` for critical functionality in `resetInvestment`. Since miners have the ability to manipulate the timestamp within a limited range, they can potentially control when `resetInvestment` can be executed. This can lead to exploitation, allowing a malicious actor to manipulate the timing of the reset and potentially drain the contract’s funds. 

The attacker contract could leverage this by repeatedly attempting to call `resetInvestment` using manipulated timestamps, leading to unexpected or unauthorized payouts.",1298,103,11.218044519424438
130,time manipulation,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to time manipulation. The issue lies in the same lines as the previous code:

- **Line 19**: `require(now != pastBlockTime);`
- **Line 21**: `pastBlockTime = now;`

Miners can manipulate the `now` (or `block.timestamp`) value within a range of 15 seconds, allowing them to influence when the contract allows a payout. The use of `now % 15 == 0` also introduces potential exploitation by miners to claim the balance under favorable conditions.",998,114,7.678629636764526
131,time manipulation,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable because it relies on `block.timestamp` to generate randomness, specifically in line 43: `var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;`. Miners can manipulate the block timestamp, making it possible for them to predict or influence the outcome of the randomness, leading to potential exploitation of the contract.",1108,72,5.953459978103638
132,short addresses,"YES, the contract is vulnerable to a short address attack for the same reason: the `sendCoin` function does not verify the correct padding of input addresses, allowing for incorrect encoding of arguments.",1155,39,13.203359603881836
133,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability still exists in the new code. Specifically, in the `emptyCreditors` function, the contract attempts to reset the `creditorAddresses` array if its length exceeds 1500 (line 16: `if(creditorAddresses.length > 1500)`). This operation can consume excessive gas, especially when the array becomes large. If the gas cost to clear the array exceeds the block gas limit, this function will never be executed successfully, causing a denial of service. Consequently, the contract can be rendered unusable if it reaches that state, and `win` can never be set to `true`.",1123,128,9.620429515838623
134,denial of service,"YES. The contract is vulnerable due to the same issue as before, specifically the `insertNnumbers` function. It can lead to a denial of service because of the dynamic resizing of the array in a loop, which can require an excessive amount of gas. If the `numbers` parameter is large enough, the gas cost will exceed the block gas limit, causing the function to fail and potentially make the contract unusable.",1223,85,10.502504348754883
135,denial of service,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack because, similar to the first code, it resets the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays in lines 48 and 50 using `new address ` and `new uint `. If a malicious user causes the array to grow very large, this operation will become increasingly expensive in gas, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. This would prevent the contract from functioning properly, leading to a denial of service.",2197,97,6.410993814468384
136,denial of service,"YES, the second smart contract is also vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll()` function at line 26. Similar to the first code, it uses the `send()` function to transfer funds to addresses, and a single failure (due to the recipient contract or address refusing funds or using too much gas) can halt the entire loop, preventing all refunds. This creates a denial of service scenario, where one failed `send()` blocks further execution of the function.",1106,95,7.189602613449097
137,denial of service,"**YES**, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray()` function. Specifically, the loop `for(uint i=0;i<350;i++)` that pushes addresses to the `listAddresses` array can lead to a **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack by consuming a significant amount of gas. If the array grows too large, the gas required to execute this function may exceed the block gas limit, causing the function to fail and making it impossible to execute. This creates a situation where users can no longer interact with the contract, effectively locking it up.",1000,120,8.961112022399902
138,denial of service,"**YES**. The vulnerability still exists because the line `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` can lead to a denial of service attack. If the `send` function fails due to the recipient having a fallback function that consumes more than 2300 gas (which is the gas limit for `send`), the transaction will revert, preventing other bidders from placing bids. This allows the current frontrunner to block future bids, leading to a denial of service.",994,97,6.16821551322937
