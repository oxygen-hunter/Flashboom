 The code has several vulnerabilities related to the `send` function.  Here's why:

* **`msg.sender.send(valuePaid)`:** This line directly sends the `valuePaid` to the `msg.sender` without any error handling. This is a common vulnerability, as it can lead to a loss of funds if the `msg.sender` is malicious.
* **`msg.sender.send(excessPaid)`:** Similar to the previous line, this line sends the `excessPaid` to the `msg.sender` without any error handling.
* **`currentMonarch.etherAddress.send(compensation)`:** This line sends the `compensation` to the `currentMonarch.etherAddress` without any error handling.

The code uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which allows an attacker to call the contract again before the initial execution is complete. This is a classic reentrancy vulnerability.

126,reentrancy,"YES

The contract allows for reentrancy attacks because it calls `withdrawBalance` again before the initial execution is complete.

The contract relies heavily on `block.timestamp` for its functionality. This makes it susceptible to manipulation by miners, as they can change the reported timestamp.

The contract has a potential vulnerability related to the `allowance` function.  The `allowance` function allows users to set an allowance for another address to spend tokens on their behalf.  This can be exploited by an attacker to drain the contract of funds.

133,denial of service,"YES

The contract has a potential denial of service vulnerability. 

Here's why:

* **Excessive Creditors:** The `emptyCreditors()` function can potentially cause a denial of service by setting the `creditorAddresses` array to an empty array. This can be exploited to make the contract unresponsive to further requests. 
* **Uncontrolled Creditors:** The `addCreditors()` function allows the contract to add an unlimited number of creditors, potentially leading to a denial of service if the number of creditors exceeds the contract's capacity. 
* **Potential for Manipulation:** The `emptyCreditors()` function can be manipulated to cause the contract to become unresponsive.

134,denial of service,"YES

The contract uses a `for` loop that iterates over a fixed number of elements. This loop could be exploited to cause a denial of service attack.

The code has a denial of service vulnerability.  The line `creditorAddresses = new address[](0);` and `creditorAmounts = new uint[](0);`  are vulnerable to denial of service attacks.

136,denial of service,"YES

The contract's `refundAll` function uses `require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]))` which is vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks. 

Here's why:

* **Single Failure:** If the `send` function fails for any address, the entire `refundAll` function will fail, halting all refunds. 
* **No Error Handling:** The code doesn't handle the possibility of a `send` failure. 
* **Potential for Abuse:**  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large amount of transactions to the contract, causing it to fail and potentially drain funds.

137,denial of service,"YES

The contract uses a `listAddresses` array to store addresses. The `ifillArray` function pushes addresses into this array, potentially leading to a denial of service attack. 

The `ifillArray` function can be exploited to fill the array with malicious addresses, causing the contract to become unresponsive.
