The `tokens_buy` function calls `c.call` with a `bytes4` hash representing a transfer function. This is a low-level call that doesn't propagate errors.  The `if(!c.call(bytes4(sha3(""transferFrom(address,address,uint256)"")),owner, msg.sender,tokens_buy)){` statement is vulnerable because it doesn't check the return value of the `c.call` function. If the transfer fails, the contract will continue to execute, potentially leading to a loss of funds.

The code has several vulnerabilities:

* **Unchecked Return Values:** The `claimThrone` function returns a boolean value, but it doesn't check if the return value is true or false. This can lead to unexpected behavior.
* **Low Level Function Calls:** The `msg.sender.send()` function is a low-level function that doesn't propagate errors. This can lead to unexpected behavior.
* **Unprotected Access:** The `transferOwnership` function allows anyone to change the contract's owner. This is a security vulnerability. 
* **Reentrancy Attacks:** The `claimThrone` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
* **Arithmetic Overflows and Underflows:** The code doesn't handle arithmetic overflows and underflows well. 
* **Timestamp Dependence:** The `claimThrone` function uses the block timestamp for critical functionality. This can be manipulated by miners. 
* **Lack of Error Handling:** The code lacks robust error handling, which can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.
