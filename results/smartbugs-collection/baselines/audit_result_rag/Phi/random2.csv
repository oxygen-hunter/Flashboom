11,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function in the `MultiOwnable` contract. The issue is that the `newOwner` function allows any user to become an owner of the contract by calling the function and passing their address as the `_owner` parameter. This means that any user can become an owner without the consent of the current owners, which is a significant access control issue.

The `newOwner` function should only allow the current owner (root) to add new owners, not any user. This can be fixed by adding a check in the `newOwner` function to ensure that only the current owner can call it. Here's an updated version of the `MultiOwnable` contract with the fix:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.23;

contract MultiOwnable {
  address public root;
  mapping (address => address) public owners;  

   
  constructor() public {
    root = msg.sender;
    owners[root] = root;
  }

    require(_owner",1130,301,13.067172050476074
12,access control," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `lock()` function of the `lockEtherPay` contract. The issue is that the `fifty_two_weeks` constant is set to 29894400, which is the number of seconds in 52 weeks. However, the `now` keyword in Solidity returns the current timestamp in seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970). This means that the `start_time` and `end_time` are not being calculated correctly, potentially leading to an incorrect lock duration.

Additionally, the `lock()` function does not check if the `end_time` is in the future, which could allow the owner to set a past date as the end time, effectively unlocking the contract immediately. This could be exploited by an attacker who gains control of the contract owner's address.

To fix this vulnerability, the `fifty_two_weeks` constant should be set to the correct number of seconds in 52 weeks (31,536,000), and the `lock()` function should check if the `end_time` is in the future before setting it.",791,273,11.96167778968811
13,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the `DynamicPyramid` function being publicly accessible, which allows anyone to call it and set the `creator` variable. This could lead to unauthorized control over the contract's functionality.",3452,58,3.315094470977783
14,access control," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the `require` statement in the `withdraw` function. The issue lies in line 22:

require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);

This line allows the `msg.sender` to withdraw an amount equal to their current balance, which could potentially lead to a reentrancy attack if the `transfer` function is called before the balance is updated.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance before calling the `transfer` function, like this:

function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
    require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    msg.sender.transfer(amount);
}

This ensures that the balance is updated before the `transfer` function is called, preventing reentrancy attacks.",993,204,8.836145877838135
15,access control," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `lock()` function of the `lockEtherPay` contract. The issue is that the `fifty_two_weeks` constant is set to 29894400, which is not the correct number of seconds in 52 weeks. The correct number should be 365 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds = 31536000 seconds.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the `end_time` value, potentially allowing them to withdraw funds from the contract before the intended time period has elapsed. This is an example of an integer overflow vulnerability.

To fix this issue, the `fifty_two_weeks` constant should be set to the correct value of 31536000 seconds.",808,200,8.693055391311646
16,access control," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to access control issues. The vulnerability lies in the `set` function, which allows anyone to add or modify entries in the `map` array without proper authorization. This can lead to unauthorized changes in the contract's state.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add an access control mechanism to restrict the `set` function to only the contract owner or other authorized addresses. This can be achieved by using the `onlyOwner` modifier or a similar access control mechanism.

Here's an example of how you can modify the `set` function to include access control:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Map {
    address public owner;
    uint256[] map;

    modifier onlyOwner {

            map.length = key + 1;
        }

        map[key] = value;
    }

17,access control," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in the `Proxy` contract.

18,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `PopBonusCode` function. The condition `require(0 <= bonusCodes.length);` is always true since array lengths are unsigned and cannot be negative. This means that the `PopBonusCode` function will not properly check if the array is empty before attempting to pop an element, which can lead to an out-of-bounds error.",1027,93,4.146988868713379
19,access control," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of the deprecated `tx.origin` for access control. The `onlyOwner` modifier checks if the `msg.sender` is equal to the `owner` address, which is fine for simple access control. However, the vulnerability arises when considering the context of the contract's interaction with other contracts or libraries.

In the `lockEtherPay` contract, the `Ownable` library is used, which likely relies on `tx.origin` for its access control. If `Ownable` uses `tx.origin`, it could bypass the `onlyOwner` modifier in the `lock` function, allowing an attacker to call the `lock` function by interacting with the contract through another contract that calls it on their behalf.

To fix this vulnerability, you should avoid using `tx.origin` for access control and instead use a more secure method like the `own` modifier provided by the `Ownable` library or implement a similar mechanism that checks the actual owner of the contract.",794,236,10.175649404525757

23,access control," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable due to the presence of the `Ownable` contract, which is not shown in the code snippet. The `Ownable` contract typically includes a modifier like `onlyOwner` that restricts certain functions to the contract owner. If the `Ownable` contract is not implemented correctly, it could lead to access control issues. However, without the actual implementation of the `Ownable` contract, it's not possible to definitively say that the `lock` function is vulnerable. If the `Ownable` contract is correctly implemented, then the `lock` function would not be vulnerable.",685,139,6.065868139266968
24,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `lock()` function of the `lockEtherPay` contract. The `lock()` function is marked as `public`, which means it can be called by any external account, not just the owner. However, the actual access control check is performed inside the function using the `onlyOwner` modifier from the `Ownable` contract. This is a subtle access control bypass because the function's visibility suggests it can be called by anyone, but the modifier restricts it to the owner only.

This can lead to confusion and potential misuse of the function by other users who might not be aware of the access control implemented inside the function. It is recommended to use the `internal` visibility for functions that are only meant to be called within the contract or by contracts derived from it, and to use the `external` visibility for functions that are meant to be called by external accounts.",789,204,8.875218391418457

The given smart contract code is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` in both the `withdraw` function and the fallback function. The `delegatecall` allows the contract to execute code in the context of another contract, which can lead to access control issues if not properly managed. In this case, the `delegatecall` is used to call functions in the `fibonacciLibrary`, which could potentially be controlled by an attacker. If the attacker can deploy a malicious contract with the same selector as the `fibSig` or `msg.data`, they could execute arbitrary code in the context of the `fibonacciLibrary`, leading to potential security breaches.",1380,150,6.74857497215271

The vulnerability lies in the `go()` function of contract B, specifically in the line:

```solidity
target.call.value(msg.value)();

This line attempts to send Ether to the `target` address using the `call.value()` low-level function. However, the return value of this function is not checked, which means that if the call fails, the contract will continue to execute without reverting the transaction. This can lead to fail-open situations and other unwanted outcomes.

To fix this vulnerability, the return value of the `call.value()` function should be checked, and the transaction should be reverted if the call fails. Here's an example of how to fix the vulnerability:

```solidity

The `token_reward.transfer(msg.sender, tokenBalance())` line is vulnerable because it does not check the return value of the `transfer()` function. If the transfer fails, the function will not revert the transaction, and the contract will continue to execute. This can lead to fail-open behavior and other unwanted outcomes.

The vulnerability lies in the `lock()` function of the `lockEtherPay` contract. The issue is with the following line:

```solidity

The `add()` function from the `SafeMath` library is used to perform the addition, which is a good practice to prevent overflow. However, the `fifty_two_weeks` constant is defined as `uint256` and has a value of `29894400`. This value is the number of seconds in 52 weeks, but it is not the maximum value that a `uint256` can hold.

The maximum value of a `uint256` is `2^256 - 1`, which is much larger than `29894400`. When adding `fifty_two_weeks` to `start_time`, there is a possibility of an overflow if `start_time` is close to the maximum value of `uint256`. In such a case, the `add()` function from the `SafeMath` library will prevent the overflow, but the contract will still be vulnerable to an integer overflow in the `fifty_two_weeks",744,301,12.722709894180298

The vulnerability lies in the `lock` function of the `lockEtherPay` contract. The line `end_time = start_time.add(fifty_two_weeks);` can cause an integer overflow if the sum of `start_time` and `fifty_two_weeks` exceeds the maximum value of a uint256.

In Solidity, the `add` function in the `SafeMath` library checks for overflow by asserting that the result is greater than or equal to the first operand. However, this assertion does not prevent the overflow from happening; it only detects it. If the assertion fails, the contract will revert, but if it passes, the overflowed value will be used, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this vulnerability, you should use the `SafeMath.add` function for the addition operation, which will revert the transaction if an overflow occurs:

```solidity
end_time = SafeMath.add(start_time, fifty_two_weeks);

The vulnerability lies in the `lock()` function of the `lockEtherPay` contract. The issue is with the following line:

The `add()` function from the `SafeMath` library is used to add `fifty_two_weeks` to `start_time`. However, the `SafeMath` library is not imported in the `lockEtherPay` contract. As a result, the default Solidity arithmetic operations are used, which do not have overflow checks.

If the sum of `start_time` and `fifty_two_weeks` exceeds the maximum value of a uint256, an integer overflow will occur, leading to an incorrect `end_time` value. This can cause the contract to behave unexpectedly, potentially allowing users to bypass the intended time lock mechanism.

To fix this vulnerability, the `SafeMath` library should be imported and used for the `add()` operation:

```solidity
import ""./SafeMath.sol"";

using SafeMath for uint256;

function lock() public onlyOwner returns (bool){
   require(!isLocked);
  ",724,301,12.852383136749268
86,arithmetic," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow due to the use of basic arithmetic operations without any overflow checks. The SafeMath library is used in the `lockEtherPay` contract, which should prevent these vulnerabilities, but the `IntegerOverflowSingleTransaction` contract does not use SafeMath and is therefore still vulnerable.",1060,77,3.458469867706299
87,arithmetic," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to arithmetic overflows and underflows. Although the SafeMath library is used to prevent such issues, the `Token` contract itself is not using SafeMath for its arithmetic operations. The vulnerability lies in the `transfer` function, specifically in lines 20 and 22, where the subtraction operation could potentially cause an underflow if the sender's balance is less than the `_value` being transferred.

To fix this vulnerability, the `Token` contract should also use SafeMath for its arithmetic operations, like this:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

import ""./SafeMath.sol"";

contract Token {

   using SafeMath for uint;

   mapping(address => uint) balances;
   uint public totalSupply;

   function Token(uint _initialSupply) {
     balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply = _initialSupply;
   }

   function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public returns (bool) {
      
     require(balances[msg.sender].sub(_value) >= 0);
      
     balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_value);

88,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is still vulnerable to integer overflow.

The reason is that the `add` function in the `SafeMath` library does not prevent integer overflow. It only asserts that the result is greater than or equal to the first operand, which is not a sufficient check for preventing overflow. The `assert` statement will not prevent the overflow from happening; it will only cause the transaction to revert if the overflow occurs. However, this does not guarantee that the overflow will always be caught, as the `assert` statement can be disabled in certain environments.

To fix this vulnerability, the `SafeMath` library should be updated to include proper overflow checks, such as using the `SafeMath` library from OpenZeppelin Contracts, which includes built-in overflow checks for arithmetic operations.",630,178,7.77556037902832

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete, which can lead to the reentrancy attack. In this case, the attacker can repeatedly call the `Collect` function before the balance is updated, potentially draining the contract's funds.",1519,111,4.967489957809448
124,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 38:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the `msg.sender` to make a call to an external contract before the execution of the `CashOut` function is complete. If the external contract being called is malicious and has a fallback function that calls back into the `CashOut` function, it can potentially withdraw funds multiple times before the balance is updated, leading to a reentrancy attack.",1383,128,5.8863749504089355
125,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 54:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. In this case, the Collect function is vulnerable to reentrancy because it allows the msg.sender to call the contract again before the balance is updated. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance before calling the external contract, or use a pattern like Checks-Effects-Interactions to ensure that the contract state is updated before making external calls.",1575,161,7.12517786026001
126,reentrancy," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to reentrancy because the `withdrawBalance` function in the `Reentrancy_insecure` contract allows external calls to be made before updating the user's balance. This means that an attacker could create a malicious contract that calls `withdrawBalance` recursively, potentially draining funds from the contract.",827,83,4.102304697036743
127,time manipulation," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `lock()` function of the `lockEtherPay` contract, where the `start_time` and `end_time` are set based on the current time (`now`). Since the miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, an attacker could potentially manipulate the block timestamp to affect the timing of the `lock()` function execution. This could lead to incorrect locking or unlocking of funds based on the manipulated time.",708,119,5.136381149291992
128,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation due to its reliance on block.timestamp for both the payOut function and the randomGen function. This can be exploited by miners who have control over the timestamp of the block they mine.",987,57,2.5750818252563477
129,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the resetInvestment function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp + ONE_MINUTE)
```

This condition checks if the current block timestamp is less than the last investment timestamp plus one minute. However, as mentioned in the provided explanation, the block timestamp can be manipulated by miners. An attacker could exploit this by mining a block with a timestamp that is slightly less than the last investment timestamp plus one minute, causing the resetInvestment function to execute and reset the jackpot prematurely.",1267,149,6.846789121627808
130,time manipulation," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `lock` function of the `lockEtherPay` contract. The `start_time` and `end_time` are set based on the current time (`now`) when the `lock` function is called. However, miners have some leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, which can be manipulated to a certain extent. This means that an attacker could potentially call the `lock` function just before a block is mined and then manipulate the block timestamp to be set after the desired `fifty_two_weeks` period, causing the contract to unlock prematurely.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should use a more reliable source of time or implement a mechanism that prevents time manipulation, such as using block numbers or a decentralized oracle for time information.",839,197,8.570389032363892
131,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same line as the first contract:

var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;

This line uses block.timestamp to generate a random number, which can be manipulated by miners. An attacker with control over the mining process could manipulate the block timestamp to influence the outcome of the random number generation, potentially affecting the distribution of winnings in the EtherLotto contract.",1053,112,4.961379289627075
132,short addresses, NO,1046,2,0.35799670219421387
133,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. This function can be exploited by repeatedly calling it to keep the `creditorAddresses` array at a length greater than 1500, which will prevent the `addCreditors` function from being able to add new creditor addresses. When the array length exceeds 1500, the `emptyCreditors` function resets the array to an empty array of length 0, which could be interpreted as a DoS attack because it disrupts the normal operation of the contract by preventing the addition of new creditor addresses.",1011,147,6.359040260314941
134,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles the dynamic resizing of the `array` when inserting elements. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the contract checks if `numElements` is equal to `array.length` and then increments `array.length` by 1.

In Solidity, when you try to access an element of an array at an index that is out of bounds, it will throw an exception and revert the transaction. However, in this code, the contract does not check if the new `numElements` value is within the bounds of the `array` after incrementing `array.length`. This can lead to a situation where the contract tries to access an element outside the bounds of the `array`, causing the transaction to revert and effectively denying service to the user.

To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `numElements` value is always within the bounds of the `array` before trying to access or modify its elements. One way to do this is by using the `push` method to add elements to the `array`, which automatically resizes the array and ensures that the index is within bounds.",1138,271,13.36912226676941
135,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the reset of the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays when a new credit cycle starts. This can be exploited by repeatedly calling the `lendGovernmentMoney` function, which resets the arrays and potentially drains the contract's balance by repeatedly sending Ether to the `corruptElite` address.",2562,99,4.766620874404907
136,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));
```

This line attempts to send Ether to each address in the `refundAddresses` array. If any of the addresses in the array is not a valid Ethereum address or if the `send` function fails for any reason (e.g., the address does not have enough Ether to send), the transaction will fail and consume all the gas provided for the transaction. This can lead to a Denial of Service attack, as the contract will be stuck in a state where it cannot proceed with any further transactions until the failed transaction is resolved.

Additionally, the `refundAll` function does not have a timeout or a way to handle failed transactions, which can lead to the contract being stuck indefinitely if a Denial of Service attack occurs.",1038,232,10.450080156326294
137,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `ifillArray` function in the `DosOneFunc` contract. This function allows any user to push up to 350 addresses into the `listAddresses` array if the array's length is less than 1500. An attacker can repeatedly call this function to fill the array, potentially causing the contract to run out of storage space for the array, leading to a DoS condition where the contract could fail to execute further functions or even become unusable.",856,127,5.584928750991821
138,denial of service," YES

The provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the use of the `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid))` statement in the `bid` function. This line of code attempts to send the current bid amount to the `currentFrontrunner`. If the `currentFrontrunner` address is a contract or a fallback function that does not handle the Ether sent to it properly, it could lead to an infinite loop or a gas limit exceeding situation, causing the transaction to fail and potentially leading to a DoS attack.

Additionally, the `tokenBalance` function in the `lockEtherPay` contract does not have a `payable` modifier, which means it cannot receive Ether. If this function is called with Ether attached, it will fail, potentially leading to a DoS attack.",846,196,8.496647357940674
