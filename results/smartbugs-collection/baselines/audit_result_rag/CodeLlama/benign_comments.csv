113,reentrancy,"  NO, the given code is not vulnerable to reentrancy attack. The code is using the `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)()` function, which is a low-level function that allows the contract to make a call to an external contract. However, the function is being called within the `withdrawBalance()` function, which is being executed by the same contract. Therefore, there is no possibility of the contract calling itself again before the initial execution is complete, and the vulnerability is not present.",656,113,4.374513864517212

The code also uses the `call.value()` function to make a call to the `msg.sender` address, which is a safe way to make a call to the same contract. The `call.value()` function allows the contract to receive Ether from the caller, but it does not allow the contract to make any new calls to other contracts.
