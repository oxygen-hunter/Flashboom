12,access control," NO.

The contract's `onlyowner` modifier properly restricts the `withdraw` function to the contract's owner. The `missing` function sets the owner to the msg.sender, so it is effectively assigning ownership to the caller. This is a common pattern for initializing contract ownership.

The contract's fallback function, `() payable`, is empty and does not contain any vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the contract is not vulnerable.",530,103,5.849270343780518
13,access control," NO. The code provided does not have the vulnerability described in the previous example. The function ""DynamicPyramid()"" is declared as a constructor and can only be called when the contract is deployed.

The contract's `IamMissing` constructor sets the `owner` address to the address of the msg.sender, which is the address of the contract deployer. Since the `withdraw` function is marked as `onlyowner`, only the `owner` address can call it. Therefore, there is no vulnerability in the given contract code.",582,77,4.496631860733032
16,access control," NO.

The given code does not have any access control vulnerabilities. The `set` function checks if the array index is within the bounds of the array before assigning a value to it. This prevents any potential out-of-bounds array access and ensures that only authorized users can modify the contract state through the `withdraw` function, which uses the `require` statement to check if the msg.sender is equal to the contract owner.",652,93,5.37166690826416

20,access control," NO.

The reason for this is that the given code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to access control. The `initWallet()` function only assigns the address of the current transaction sender to the `creator` variable, which does not pose any security risk on its own. The other functions in the contract, such as `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `migrateTo()`, all have proper access control checks in place using `require()` and `assert()` statements.",783,108,6.19169020652771
21,access control," YES, the contract is vulnerable due to the use of `tx.origin` to check the contract owner.

The reason for this is that in the provided code, the `send()` function calls are wrapped inside the `tokens_buy()` function, which returns a boolean value indicating success or failure. In this case, the code checks the return value of the `tokens_buy()` function and only continues if it is true. This means that the `send()` function calls are properly checked and the contract is not vulnerable to the type of failure-to-check vulnerability that was present in the previous code example.",1916,113,6.76309871673584

The code you provided is not vulnerable to arithmetic overflows or underflows, as it uses unsigned integers and checks for a balance sufficient to cover the transfer amount before making the transfer.",668,46,2.8519370555877686
88,arithmetic," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to arithmetic overflows. The line ""count += input;"" can cause the counter variable ""count"" to overflow if the input value is large enough. This can lead to unexpected behavior or even security vulnerabilities.",411,54,3.2277591228485107
89,arithmetic," NO. The given code does not contain any arithmetic overflow or underflow vulnerabilities. The contract's add function simply adds the input value to the sellerBalance variable without any checks, but it does not result in a vulnerability in this case.",531,53,3.184534788131714
90,arithmetic, NO. The given code is not vulnerable to arithmetic overflows or underflows as it uses the'require' statement to ensure that the transfer amount is less than or equal to the sender's balance before making the transfer. This ensures that the balance cannot go below zero or exceed the maximum value of a uint256.,504,71,4.1573708057403564
91,bad randomness," NO. The code does not use randomness in an insecure way. The use of `blockhash()` to obtain the block hash is not a vulnerability, as the block hash is not used for generating random numbers but rather for verifying the correctness of a guess.",855,58,3.5349202156066895
92,bad randomness," NO.

The code provided does not use the block number or the sender's address as seeds for generating randomness, which was the vulnerability in the previous code example. Instead, it uses three predefined addresses and the block difficulty as seeds for generating randomness using the Keccak-256 hash function. This approach is considered safer than using block number or sender's address as seeds.",3282,85,5.792953014373779
93,bad randomness," NO.

The reason why the given contract code is not vulnerable is that it does not use the `rand()` function to generate randomness in a critical part of the contract's logic. Instead, the contract uses the index of the unpaid entries to determine which entry to pay out. This approach is not vulnerable to reentrancy attacks or other types of vulnerabilities related to randomness.",3563,83,5.7839765548706055
94,bad randomness, NO. The code does not use randomness from the block number in a way that can be exploited. The contract only checks if the current block number is even or odd and does not rely on its unpredictability for critical functionality.,1198,49,3.161651372909546
95,bad randomness," YES, The vulnerability is in the way the random number is generated. The random number is generated based on the previous block's hash and the current block timestamp, which can be predicted. This makes the number not truly random and can be exploited.",643,54,3.271785259246826
96,bad randomness," NO. The code provided does not use any insecure method to generate randomness. However, it is still important to note that generating true randomness on the Ethereum blockchain is difficult and may not be suitable for all use cases. It is generally recommended to use a trusted off-chain randomness source or a decentralized randomness beacon service.",829,75,4.441744804382324
97,reentrancy," NO. The use of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `Collect` function is not the same as the vulnerable call in the provided example. In this case, the external call is made before the state change in the `Collect` function, so there is no risk of reentrancy attacks.",1233,69,4.2200257778167725
98,reentrancy," NO. The code you provided does not contain the vulnerability described earlier. The use of msg.sender.call.value() within a require statement is not a safe practice, but it is not the cause of the reentrancy vulnerability. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the contract state can be changed during the execution of the require statement that calls an external contract. In the provided code, the require statement is executed before the msg.sender.call.value() statement, so the contract state should not be affected by the external call. However, it is still not a best practice to call an external contract within a require statement, as it can make the contract harder to understand and test.",824,144,8.164639472961426
99,reentrancy," YES, the contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks due to the use of the 'call.value()' function in the 'Collect' function. This function allows the contract to call an external contract and send ether to it, but it does not check if the external call completes before continuing with the contract's execution. This can allow an attacker to call the 'Collect' function multiple times before the initial call completes, draining the contract of funds.",1305,99,5.856415271759033
100,reentrancy," YES, the contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks due to the use of the `msg.sender.call.value()` function call within the `withdraw` function.

104,reentrancy," NO.

The vulnerability in the original code was that the `getFirstWithdrawalBonus` function called `withdrawReward` without checking if the previous call to `withdrawReward` had completed. In the modified code, `withdrawReward` is called after `claimedBonus[recipient]` is set to `true`, so there is no longer a risk of reentrancy attacks.",806,91,5.386309862136841

119,reentrancy," NO. The use of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` within a transaction that spends the contract's ether (CashOut function) is not a recommended practice due to the reentrancy risk, but it is not a vulnerability per se. The contract's state is not being modified during the call to `msg.sender`, so the contract's state remains the same while the call is being executed. However, it is still a good practice to avoid this pattern and use the check-effects-interleave pattern instead to prevent reentrancy attacks.",1263,125,7.239246606826782

In this case, the `call.value` function returns a promise that resolves to a boolean indicating success or failure of the called contract's function execution. The contract waits for the promise to resolve before continuing with the next instruction. This is not the same as directly executing the called contract's function without waiting for its completion, which is the cause of the vulnerability in the example.",1113,122,7.101689338684082

This can be exploited by a miner to manipulate the contract's state by reporting an incorrect timestamp.",468,85,4.849256753921509
128,time manipulation," NO.

The reason the original contract was vulnerable was because it relied on the block timestamp for generating random numbers and for determining if a certain condition had been met for a certain amount of time. However, in the provided code, the `randomGen()` function is not used for generating random numbers, and the condition in the `payOut()` function is not based on the block timestamp. Therefore, the contract is not vulnerable.",743,91,5.314160346984863
129,time manipulation," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the use of `block.timestamp` in the `lastInvestmentTimestamp` variable assignment in the `invest()` function.

137,denial of service," YES, this smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the for loop that pushes the msg.sender address to the listAddresses array up to 350 times if the array length is less than 1500.
