11,access control," Yes, the vulnerability lies in the TestContract's withdrawAll function. It transfers all the contract's funds to the caller without checking if the caller is the contract owner or not. This can be exploited by an attacker to drain the contract's funds. In the MultiOwnable contract, the onlyOwner modifier is not being properly used in the TestContract's withdrawAll function.",979,85,4.657902002334595
12,access control," The given smart contract code is not the one provided in the question for auditing. However, I will evaluate the provided code for vulnerabilities.

The code consists of three contracts: Missing, SafeMath, and StandardToken. The Missing contract is the one audited in the question. The SafeMath and StandardToken contracts are libraries and are used by the Missing contract.

The Missing contract has a vulnerability in its constructor function,'missing'. The function sets the contract owner to the msg.sender, which is the address of the caller. This means that anyone can call the'missing' function and become the contract owner. Once the owner, they can call the 'withdraw' function to drain the contract of its funds.

The vulnerability is an access control issue. The 'onlyowner' modifier is used to restrict the 'withdraw' function to the contract owner. However, the'missing' function is public and does not use the 'onlyowner' modifier. This allows anyone to call the'missing' function and become the contract owner.

Therefore, the answer is 'YES' and the vulnerability is an access control issue.",660,247,13.224947929382324

15,access control," The given smart contract code is not the one provided in the question for auditing. The code provided in the question was a simple contract named ""Missing"" with a vulnerability in its constructor.

Without specifically auditing the provided code, I cannot definitively say whether it is vulnerable or not. However, based on the given code, there do not appear to be any obvious vulnerabilities related to the access control or the use of the SafeMath library. The only potential issue is the use of the ""public constant"" keyword for the ""allowance"" function, which may not be necessary and could potentially be changed to ""public"" or ""external"" depending on the intended use case.

Therefore, my answer is 'NO', but with the caveat that a more thorough audit would be required to fully assess the security of the contract.",674,207,11.071640491485596

19,access control," The given smart contract code is not the one provided in the question for auditing. However, I will evaluate the provided code for vulnerabilities.

The code consists of three contracts: Missing, SafeMath, and StandardToken. The Missing contract is the one audited in the question. The SafeMath library is a common library used for arithmetic operations in Solidity. The StandardToken contract is an implementation of the ERC20 standard for creating fungible tokens.

The Missing contract does not have any apparent vulnerabilities. It has proper access control through the onlyowner modifier, and the constructor sets the contract owner. The contract also has a fallback function that does not have any vulnerabilities.

The SafeMath library is a common library and does not have any vulnerabilities in this implementation.

The StandardToken contract is a standard implementation of the ERC20 token standard. It uses the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations and has proper access control for its functions.

This vulnerability is similar to the one in the previous question, where the contract relies on the current block timestamp reported by the miner. If a miner were to manipulate the timestamp, they could potentially transfer the contract balance to an attacker's address instead of the intended recipient.

Based on the given code, there is no obvious vulnerability in the ""DosAuction"" contract. However, the ""StandardToken"" contract may have vulnerabilities that are not apparent from the given code alone. For example, the ""allowance()"" function is marked as ""constant"", but it modifies the ""remaining"" variable, which is not allowed in constant functions. This could potentially be a vulnerability if the contract is used in a specific way.

Therefore, the answer is:

NO (but the ""StandardToken"" contract may have vulnerabilities not apparent from the given code alone)",718,232,12.338218212127686
