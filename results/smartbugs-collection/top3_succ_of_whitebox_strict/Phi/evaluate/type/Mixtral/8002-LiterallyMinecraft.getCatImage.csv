The contract ""FibonacciLib"" itself does not seem to have any major vulnerabilities, but it is important to note that the getCatImage function is hardcoded with a specific image data, which can be a potential security risk if this image data is sensitive or contains any backdoors. It is recommended to store such data off-chain or use a secure method to store it on-chain.

Therefore, the outer contract ""LiterallyMinecraft"" is not directly vulnerable, but it contains a vulnerable inner contract ""lottopollo"".",time manipulation,3.0,634.0,6.0,0.7628111839294434
129,time manipulation," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable to a time manipulation attack. The vulnerability lies in the `resetInvestment()` function in the `Governmental` contract, specifically the condition `if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp+ONE_MINUTE)`. An attacker can manipulate the block timestamp to bypass this check and steal the jackpot.",time manipulation,3.0,594.0,6.0,0.7794215679168701
130,time manipulation," NO.

The contract does not rely on the current time in a way that can be exploited through time manipulation. The requirement in the constructor that the contract can only be called once per block (`require(now!= pastBlockTime)`) and the updating of `pastBlockTime` after each call are not vulnerable to time manipulation attacks because the contract's state is not dependent on the exact block timestamp. Instead, the contract uses the monotonic increase of the block number to ensure that each call is unique within a block.",time manipulation,1.0,632.0,6.0,0.7734789848327637
131,time manipulation," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to time manipulation attacks due to the use of `block.timestamp` in the generation of random numbers. The contract's `play` function uses the SHA3 hash of the current block timestamp to generate a random number, but since miners can manipulate the reported timestamp, this can be exploited to manipulate the contract's random number generation and potentially gain an unfair advantage.",time manipulation,3.0,607.0,6.0,0.8549103736877441
132,short addresses," Based on the given code, the smart contract ""MyToken"" is not vulnerable to short addresses. The vulnerability described in the text provided is a different issue called ""short addresses"" which is not related to the code provided. The code provided only defines a simple token contract with a sendCoin function, and it does not contain any function that accepts addresses as arguments in a way that could be vulnerable to short addresses attacks.",short addresses,1.0,613.0,6.0,0.7643845081329346
133,denial of service," Based on the given code, the smart contract ""LiterallyMinecraft"" does not appear to be vulnerable to denial of service attacks as it does not contain any functions that allow users to add an arbitrary number of elements to an array or struct, which are common vectors for denial of service attacks. The contract's ""addCreditors"" function only allows adding a fixed number of 350 addresses to the ""creditorAddresses"" array. Therefore, the contract should be considered safe from denial of service attacks based on the provided code.",denial of service,1.0,635.0,6.0,0.773345947265625
134,denial of service," Based on the given code, the contract ""LiterallyMinecraft"" does not appear to be vulnerable to denial of service attacks as it does not contain any loops or dynamic array resizing functions that could be exploited for this purpose. The contract mainly consists of read-only functions and a struct definition, and the ""insertNnumbers"" function in the inner contract ""DosNumber"" is not present in this contract. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",denial of service,1.0,619.0,6.0,0.791968584060669
135,denial of service," The given smart contract code, ""Government.sol"", does not appear to be vulnerable to denial of service attacks based on the provided code alone. However, it is important to note that a thorough security analysis would require a more in-depth review of the contract's functionality, interactions, and potential edge cases.

The ""LiterallyMinecraft.sol"" contract, on the other hand, is not a part of the Government contract and should not be considered in the analysis of the Government contract's vulnerabilities. It is a separate contract with its own functionality and potential vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the answer for the Government contract is 'NO'.",denial of service,1.0,653.0,6.0,0.8057782649993896
136,denial of service," NO.

The given contract, ""LiterallyMinecraft,"" does not have a vulnerability related to the denial of service attack described earlier. The contract's primary purpose is to manage and return a predefined cat image based on the given x and y coordinates. It does not involve any transfer of funds or interact with external contracts in a way that could lead to a denial of service attack.",denial of service,1.0,605.0,6.0,0.9001491069793701
137,denial of service," Based on the given code, the contract ""LiterallyMinecraft"" itself is not vulnerable to a denial of service attack as it does not contain any function that can be repeatedly called to consume excessive resources or cause the contract to fail to process other transactions. However, the contract ""DosOneFunc"" that is defined within ""LiterallyMinecraft"" is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the ""ifillArray()"" function, which allows any caller to add their address to the ""listAddresses"" array up to a length of 1500. If an attacker repeatedly calls this function, they can fill the array with their addresses, causing the contract to run out of memory and fail to process other transactions. This can result in a denial of service for the contract.",denial of service,3.0,687.0,6.0,0.90262770652771
138,denial of service," Based on the given code, the smart contract ""DosAuction"" is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the line where the contract sends ether to the current frontrunner before updating the contract state. An attacker can exploit this by repeatedly calling the bid function with a small amount of ether, causing the current frontrunner to run out of ether and preventing them from bidding again. This can effectively deny service to the current frontrunner and potentially prevent other bidders from participating in the auction.

The ""LiterallyMinecraft"" contract, on the other hand, does not appear to have any vulnerabilities related to the given code snippet. It is just a simple contract that returns a predefined cat image and some additional data.",denial of service,3.0,677.0,6.0,0.7571160793304443
