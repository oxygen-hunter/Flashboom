The contract's `Collect` function allows an attacker to call `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` before the `if` statement is evaluated. This means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `if` statement allows the contract to call an external contract (`msg.sender.call.value(_am)`) before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Reentrancy Vulnerability:** This creates a window for an attacker to call the `Collect` function repeatedly, draining the contract's funds.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **Uncontrolled External Calls:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function allows external calls to the contract's `Withdraw` function.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `WithdrawToHolder` multiple times, each time attempting to drain funds from the contract. 
* **No Safeguard:** The function doesn't include any safeguards to prevent this.
