The contract uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `Collect` function. This line allows an attacker to call the `Collect` function repeatedly, draining the contract of funds. This is a classic reentrancy attack.

The contract uses a function `withdrawBalance` that allows the caller to withdraw funds. This function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because it allows the caller to call the function again before the initial execution is complete.

The contract relies on `block.timestamp` for its functionality, which is susceptible to manipulation by miners. This can lead to the contract being exploited to manipulate the state of the contract.
