The vulnerability lies in the `missing` function, which can be called publicly and allows anyone to reset the contract's owner to their own address.

The vulnerability is in the constructor function `Constructor`. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, constructors should be defined using the same name as the contract.

The vulnerability stems from the `sudicideAnyone()` function, which allows anyone to call `selfdestruct` and transfer the contract's funds to the caller (`msg.sender`). There is no access control mechanism in place to restrict who can invoke this function. This means that anyone can execute this function and effectively destroy the contract, transferring its balance to their own account.

The contract is vulnerable due to the unchecked low-level `send` function calls.

It is vulnerable due to the use of the `send()` function at two places (lines 109 and 141), which is a low-level call.

The smart contract is vulnerable to a front-running attack, just like the previous one. The vulnerability lies in the `solve` function where it requires `require(hash == sha3(solution))` (line 27).

2. **Line 35: `players[tot] = Player(msg.sender, number)`** - Since the players' numbers are stored and used to determine the winner in `andTheWinnerIs`, a malicious user could exploit this information by front-running a legitimate player's move and manipulate the outcome.

The smart contract is vulnerable because it uses predictable values for randomness. Specifically, the following lines contribute to this vulnerability:

The vulnerability in this contract lies in the randomness implementation, specifically in the `rand` function (line 127-132).

The vulnerability is similar to the one previously mentioned:

This can result in a denial of service, as the `emptyCreditors` function may not be able to complete when the array grows too large, thus preventing the contract from functioning as intended.",1247,118,6.829037666320801
134,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability still exists due to the same reason: the dynamic resizing of the array in the `insertNnumbers` function. The code at lines 18-22 causes a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack because of the way the array is resized within the loop. Each time an element is inserted, it dynamically adjusts the length of the array, which can consume an excessive amount of gas, especially when a large number of elements are inserted. This can lead to failure in contract execution due to out-of-gas errors.",1347,110,12.142994403839111
135,denial of service,"YES

It is vulnerable because the contract is susceptible to a ""Denial of Service"" (DoS) attack. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from using the `send()` function to transfer funds to creditors in the `lendGovernmentMoney()` function. If a creditor is a contract that deliberately fails to receive the funds (either by having a fallback function that reverts or uses excessive gas), it can prevent the rest of the creditors from being paid out, effectively locking the contract. Additionally, resetting the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays with `new address ` and `new uint ` could cause critical information loss.",2321,128,10.730980396270752
136,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is still present in the `refundAll` function, where the line:

```solidity
require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));
```

can cause a denial of service. If any one of the `send` calls fails (due to insufficient gas, a rejection from the recipient, or other reasons), the entire loop will stop, preventing the rest of the addresses from receiving their refunds. This type of vulnerability can cause the contract to become unusable, as a single failing recipient could block the execution for all others.",1230,122,8.289274454116821
137,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability still exists in the second smart contract, specifically in the `ifillArray()` function, which contains the loop starting at line 26. The loop iterates 350 times, pushing addresses into the `listAddresses` array. This could lead to a **Denial of Service (DoS)** by exhausting the gas limit, especially as the array grows larger. This is the same issue as in the first contract, making the function increasingly expensive to execute and eventually causing it to fail.",1124,102,8.7651686668396
138,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the line `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));`. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack because if the `send` function fails (for example, if the recipient's fallback function runs out of gas or is malicious), it will revert the transaction, preventing any new bids from being placed and essentially freezing the auction.",1117,84,6.7318360805511475
