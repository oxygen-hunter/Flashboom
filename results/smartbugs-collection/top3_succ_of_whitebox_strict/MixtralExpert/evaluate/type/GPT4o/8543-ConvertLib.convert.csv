In the `solve` function, the line `require(hash == sha3(solution));` exposes the solution when a user submits a transaction. A malicious user can observe the pending transaction on the public blockchain, copy the solution, and send their own transaction with higher gas fees to claim the reward before the original transaction is confirmed.",front running,3.0,519.0,6.0,2.8704090118408203

76,front running,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. The same front-running vulnerability exists in the `play` function (line 28), where players submit their numbers.

77,arithmetic,"YES.  
The vulnerability lies in both the original code and the added `convert` function. In the `init` function, the line `map[k] -= v;` can cause an integer underflow, as subtracting a larger value `v` from a smaller value in `map[k]` may wrap around to a large number. Additionally, in the `convert` function, multiplying `amount` by `conversionRate` can result in an integer overflow if the product exceeds the maximum value allowed by the `uint` type. Both scenarios are examples of arithmetic vulnerabilities.",arithmetic,4.0,549.0,6.0,3.2919507026672363
78,arithmetic,"YES. The contract is vulnerable to an integer overflow in the `convert` function, where the multiplication of `amount` and `conversionRate` is not checked for overflow.

Both places involve unchecked multiplication of unsigned integers, making the contract vulnerable to overflows.",arithmetic,4.0,510.0,6.0,2.533635377883911
79,arithmetic,"YES. The contract is vulnerable due to the potential for integer overflow in the `convert` function.

The vulnerability lies in two areas:

1. **Line 20 (`count -= input`)**: Similar to the original code, this line is vulnerable to an arithmetic underflow, which can occur if `input > count`. Since `count` is an unsigned integer (`uint`), subtracting a larger value results in wrapping around to a very large number, thus causing unintended behavior.

2. **Line 15 (`return amount * conversionRate`)**: The multiplication of `amount` and `conversionRate` may cause an overflow if the result exceeds the maximum value of a `uint`.

The vulnerability lies in the same function as in the previous contract, specifically the `rand` function. This function attempts to generate randomness using the previous block's hash (`block.blockhash(lastBlockNumber)`) and some arithmetic manipulations.

- Line 19: `if(numElements == array.length)` dynamically increases the array size by 1 in each iteration when needed.
- Line 20: `array.length += 1;` resizes the array, which is an expensive operation in terms of gas.

This makes the contract susceptible to DoS attacks if the array grows large enough, as it could require excessive gas to execute, potentially exceeding the block gas limit and making the function uncallable.",denial of service,3.0,594.0,6.0,3.6331400871276855
135,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability is still present. The contract's `lendGovernmentMoney` function, in particular the lines resetting `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` to empty arrays (lines 46 and 48), can lead to a **denial of service** attack. If a contract uses loops or array manipulations in its logic, such as the payout mechanism relying on the state of these arrays, resetting them prematurely or under incorrect conditions can cause failures or prevent further operations from being executed correctly.",denial of service,3.0,536.0,6.0,3.3270106315612793
136,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable.",denial of service,3.0,447.0,6.0,1.872626543045044
137,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability remains in the `ifillArray` function, specifically due to the loop:

- **Line 17**: `for(uint i=0;i<350;i++) {`
- **Line 18**: `listAddresses.push(msg.sender);`

This loop appends 350 addresses to the `listAddresses` array, potentially causing the contract to consume excessive gas as the array grows, leading to a denial of service (DoS). When the array becomes large, future calls to the `ifillArray` function could require more gas than allowed, preventing successful execution and making the contract vulnerable to being permanently unusable.",denial of service,3.0,564.0,6.0,1.6844696998596191
138,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the same line:

```solidity
require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));
```

This can result in a denial of service (DoS) because if the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that has a fallback function designed to fail or consume all the available gas, it will prevent further bids. This is because the `send` function returns false if it fails, which will trigger the `require` statement and revert the transaction. This can stop the auction from proceeding, effectively causing a denial of service.",denial of service,3.0,552.0,6.0,2.917287826538086
