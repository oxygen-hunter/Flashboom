 The code has several vulnerabilities related to the `send` function.  Here's why:

* **`msg.sender.send(valuePaid)`:** This line sends the `valuePaid` to the `msg.sender` address.  This is a potential vulnerability because `send` can fail. If the `msg.sender` address is not the intended recipient, the transaction will fail, and the funds will not be sent. 
* **`msg.sender.send(excessPaid)`:**  Similar to the previous vulnerability, this line sends the `excessPaid` to the `msg.sender` address. 
* **`currentMonarch.etherAddress.send(compensation)`:** This line sends the `compensation` to the `currentMonarch.etherAddress`.  This is a potential vulnerability because `send` can fail. If the `currentMonarch.etherAddress` is not the intended recipient, the transaction will fail, and the funds will not be sent.
