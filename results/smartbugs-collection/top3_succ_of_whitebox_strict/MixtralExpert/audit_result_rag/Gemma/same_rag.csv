The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `if` statement allows the `Collect` function to call an external contract (`msg.sender.call.value(_am)`) before the `acc.balance` is updated.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `Collect` multiple times, each time attempting to drain the contract's funds. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `if` statement doesn't guarantee that the external contract call will be completed before the `acc.balance` is updated.

The code has a reentrancy vulnerability in the `Collect` function.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `Collect` function calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which allows an attacker to potentially call the contract again before the initial execution is complete. 
* **Reentrancy:** This creates a reentrancy vulnerability because the contract's state can be changed in the middle of its execution.
