11,access control," YES, The vulnerability is in the `newOwner` function in the `MultiOwnable` contract. It allows any address to set another address as the owner, as long as it is not the zero address. This can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the contract. In the `TestContract` contract, the `withdrawAll` function can be used to drain the contract's funds if an attacker is able to set themselves as the owner.",811,102,6.126640319824219
12,access control," YES, the contract is vulnerable to access control issues. The `missing()` function sets the `owner` address to the `msg.sender` without any checks, allowing any address to become the owner of the contract. This bypasses the intended access control mechanism implemented by the `onlyowner` modifier in the `withdraw()` function.",492,74,4.508943557739258
13,access control," YES, The contract is vulnerable due to the 'DynamicPyramid' function which sets the 'creator' variable to'msg.sender'. This means that anyone can call the 'DynamicPyramid' function and become the contract owner, bypassing the intended access control.",3075,60,4.666621923446655
14,access control," YES, the contract is vulnerable to access control attacks. The `withdraw` function can be called by any address as long as they have sufficient balance. However, the `migrateTo` function can only be called by the contract creator. An attacker could drain the contract of funds by repeatedly calling the `withdraw` function, and then call the `migrateTo` function to transfer the remaining funds to their own address. This bypasses the intended access control mechanism.",688,100,5.9602344036102295
15,access control," YES, the contract is vulnerable to access control issues. The constructor function `IamMissing()` sets the contract owner to the msg.sender, which is the address of the caller during contract deployment. However, this function is marked as public, meaning that anyone can call it and set the contract owner to any address they want. This bypasses the intended access control mechanism using the `onlyowner` modifier in the `withdraw()` function.",506,95,5.640781879425049
16,access control," YES, The contract does not properly check the input parameters of the `set` function, allowing any address to modify the contract's state by setting values for any key. This is an access control vulnerability.",596,45,2.925691604614258
17,access control," YES, the contract is vulnerable to access control issues due to the use of `delegatecall` without proper validation of the callee address or the data being passed to it. This can allow an attacker to call arbitrary functions on the contract or even call external contracts, potentially leading to the loss of funds or sensitive data.",448,67,4.120807886123657
18,access control," YES, the contract is vulnerable due to the lack of bounds checking on array indices in the PopBonusCode and UpdateBonusCodeAt functions. This can allow an attacker to manipulate the array indices and potentially gain unauthorized access to the contract's state. The require statement in line 21 and 25 only checks if the index is less than the current length of the array, but since array lengths are unsigned, this condition will always be true if the length is zero. This can lead to an out-of-bounds array access and potentially serious consequences, such as data corruption or contract state modification by an attacker.",711,133,7.743815183639526
19,access control," YES, the contract is vulnerable to access control issues. The constructor function is marked as public, which means anyone can call it and become the owner of the contract. This can lead to unintended consequences or malicious actors taking control of the contract. In this case, it would be better to make the constructor function onlycallable by an already initialized contract or a trusted address.",495,79,4.785987615585327
20,access control," YES, The vulnerability is due to the creator address being set to msg.sender in the initWallet() function, making it possible for any address to become the creator and call the migrateTo() function. This bypasses the access control intended by requiring creator to be equal to msg.sender in the migrateTo() function.",708,71,4.375360488891602
21,access control," YES, the contract is vulnerable due to the use of `tx.origin` to check the contract owner. This can be bypassed through various methods such as contract delegation or reentrancy attacks. Instead, consider using the `msg.sender` or `Mrproper` pattern to ensure only the contract owner can call the `sendTo` function.",441,76,4.585165500640869
22,access control," YES, The contract's `withdraw` and `refund` functions allow any address to transfer funds from the contract, as long as they have sufficient balance. The `require` statement in the `migrateTo` function only checks that the caller is the contract creator, not that they have sufficient balance. This means that an attacker could call the `withdraw` or `refund` function to drain the contract of funds.",742,92,5.536118984222412
23,access control," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to access control issues. The `sudicideAnyone()` function allows any address to call it and initiate a self-destruct transaction, transferring all the contract's funds to the caller. This can lead to unintended consequences and potential loss of funds.",385,66,4.036188364028931
24,access control," YES, the contract is vulnerable to access control attacks. The `changeOwner` function is marked as `public`, which means anyone can call it. However, it modifies the `owner` variable, which is marked as `private`. This creates a conflict between the `public` and `private` access control, allowing anyone to call the `changeOwner` function and modify the contract's state. This is a common issue with Solidity contracts and can lead to serious security vulnerabilities. To fix this issue, the `changeOwner` function should be marked as `onlyowner` or `require(msg.sender == owner)` to ensure that only the contract owner can call it.",496,143,8.285216331481934
25,access control," YES, the contract is vulnerable to access control attacks. The `require(tx.origin == owner)` statement in the `withdrawAll` function allows only the contract owner to call this function. However, `tx.origin` is the address of the account that initiated the current transaction, not the address of the contract's caller. This means that if an attacker creates a contract that calls the `withdrawAll` function, they can bypass the access control check and drain the contract's funds. Instead, the contract should use `msg.sender` to check the address of the contract's caller.",473,130,7.559286117553711
26,access control," YES, The vulnerability lies in the use of `delegatecall` without proper input validation. The contract calls an external contract's function without checking the return value, which can lead to unintended consequences if the external function modifies the contract's state or returns an error. In this case, the contract is calling `setFibonacci` function of `FibonacciLib` contract without checking its return value, which can lead to unintended state changes or security vulnerabilities.",1069,105,6.353616714477539

28,unchecked low level calls," YES, the contract is vulnerable due to the unchecked use of the send() function. In the tokens\_buy() function, the contract sends ether to owner2 without checking the return value of the send() function. Similarly, in the withdraw() function, the contract sends ether to the owner without checking the return value. If the send() function fails, the contract will continue executing and not revert the transaction, leading to potential loss of funds.",1531,97,6.005670547485352

This can allow them to prematurely end or extend the sale, leading to potential security and financial risks.",411,70,4.266720294952393
128,time manipulation," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the use of `block.timestamp` in the `payOut` function to determine if enough time has passed before sending funds. This can be manipulated by miners, allowing them to potentially drain the contract of funds. Additionally, the `randomGen` function also returns `block.timestamp` which is used in the `draw` function to generate random numbers, making the randomness generated by the contract insecure.",686,96,5.738234281539917

132,short addresses," Yes, this smart contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `sendCoin` function does not include any checks or safeguards to prevent an attacker from calling another contract function or making a transaction while the `sendCoin` function is still being executed. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the `sendCoin` function with the same `to` address, draining the sender's balance before the original transaction is completed. To mitigate this vulnerability, consider using the `.` notation to call internal functions, or using the `require` statement to check that no external transactions are being processed before making internal state changes.",758,144,8.381998538970947
133,denial of service," YES, The contract is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The function 'emptyCreditors()' can be called repeatedly with a length of 'creditorAddresses' greater than 1500, which will reset the 'creditorAddresses' array and set the 'win' variable to true. This effectively denies access to the contract for legitimate users as the 'creditorAddresses' array is empty and the 'win' variable indicates that the attacker has won.",717,107,6.381882667541504
134,denial of service," YES, the contract is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function where the contract does not check if there is enough space in the array before adding new elements. An attacker can exploit this by sending multiple transactions with large numbers of elements to be added, causing the contract to run out of gas and fail to process legitimate transactions. In the `clearDOS` function, the contract also sets the array to an empty array, but does not reset the `numElements` variable, which can be used to trigger the DoS attack again.",848,130,7.648832082748413
135,denial of service," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the repeated initialization of `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays in the `lendGovernmentMoney` function. This can lead to the loss of previously stored data and denial of service to legitimate users.",2236,61,4.296324729919434
136,denial of service," YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll()` function where the contract sends ether to each refund address in a loop using the `require()` statement. If any of the `send()` calls fail, the entire loop will fail and no refunds will be processed. An attacker can manipulate this by providing an invalid address or an address with insufficient funds to cause the `send()` call to fail, effectively denying service to all other refund addresses.",732,115,6.822244644165039
137,denial of service," YES, this contract is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray()` function, specifically the for loop that pushes the msg.sender address into the `listAddresses` array up to 350 times if the array length is less than 1500. An attacker can repeatedly call this function, causing the contract to store an excessive number of addresses in the array, which can lead to a Denial of Service attack by consuming a significant amount of gas or storage. Additionally, the contract does not properly reset the array when the length limit is reached, allowing the attack to continue even after the limit is reached.",564,147,8.515998601913452
138,denial of service," YES, the contract is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the line `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));`. This line sends ether from `currentFrontrunner` to the contract with the amount equal to `currentBid`. If `currentFrontrunner` is an attacker, they can drain the contract of all its ether by repeatedly calling the `bid` function. Additionally, the contract does not check if the sender has enough ether to call the `bid` function, allowing anyone to call it regardless of their balance. This can lead to a denial of service attack where the contract is drained of all its ether and becomes unavailable for legitimate users.",550,161,9.255855798721313
