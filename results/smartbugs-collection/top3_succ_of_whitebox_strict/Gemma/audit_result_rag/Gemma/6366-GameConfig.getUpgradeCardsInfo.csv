The `getUpgradeCardsInfo` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The function calls external contracts (`upgradeInfo[upgradecardId].coinCost`, `upgradeInfo[upgradecardId].ethCost`, etc.) which could be manipulated by an attacker.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call `getUpgradeCardsInfo` multiple times within a short period, potentially draining funds from the contract.

The `getUpgradeCardsInfo` function allows an attacker to call the `withdrawBalance` function repeatedly, potentially draining the contract of funds. This is because the `withdrawBalance` function is not designed to handle multiple calls.
