The function `DynamicPyramid` is intended to be a constructor, but in the version of Solidity used (`^0.4.15`), constructors are supposed to have the same name as the contract. In this case, the contract's name is `Rubixi`, so the intended constructor is just a regular function that anyone can call, allowing any user to set themselves as the `creator`.

Misconfiguring access control can lead to potential exploits. Additionally, in the `migrateTo` function, funds are transferred to the given address without any checks on whether the address is valid or secure.

15,access control,"YES, the `TerocoinToken` contract is vulnerable. 

The `Missing` contract has an access control vulnerability because it allows any user to become the owner of the contract by calling the `IamMissing` function. This is because `IamMissing` is a public function that sets the owner to `msg.sender`, thereby potentially allowing anyone other than the intended owner to call it and gain control over the contract, including its funds.

Although this specific vulnerability isn't repeated in the `TerocoinToken` contract, the common oversight in smart contract development is what connects them. The `TerocoinToken` contract fails to demonstrate explicit oversight ensuring that an ownership transfer mechanism is secure or that other critical functions are protected against unauthorized access. The owner is assigned only once in the constructor, and the contract lacks functions to change ownership or prevent misuse.

16,access control,"YES

The vulnerability in the `TerocoinToken` contract lies in the fact that the `owner` state variable, which is used for access control with the `onlyOwner` modifier, is not adequately protected. There are no functions in the provided code that allow the `owner` to be changed after the contract deployment, which is generally good for security. However, if there were any additional functions (even not shown in this snippet) that allow ownership change without proper checks, it could lead to unauthorized access. Furthermore, the initial deployment sets the deployer as the owner, which can be a risk if private keys are compromised or if the contract's ownership logic is modified later. Another potential vulnerability is the trust implicitly granted to the `_feeWallet`, which receives fees, as it assumes the specified address will handle fees appropriately without misuse. 

To ensure robustness, access control beyond simply setting an owner at deployment should be considered, along with potential future modifications and the security implications of trusted addresses like `_feeWallet`.",1563,204,5.963432550430298

The lack of a protected mechanism to change critical parameters such as `_feeWallet`, which could lead to unauthorized modification if there were functions to do so without the `onlyOwner` modifier.

26,access control,"YES. The smart contract `FibonacciBalance` is vulnerable due to the use of `delegatecall` without proper access control. Specifically, it is vulnerable for the following reasons:

1. **Line 31: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(fibSig, withdrawalCounter));`** - The use of `delegatecall` allows external code execution in the context of the calling contract, which means that any contract can be set as the `fibonacciLibrary`, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution and altering the contract's state, including critical variables and fund transfers.

2. **Line 38: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(msg.data));`** - The fallback function uses `delegatecall` with any `msg.data`, enabling an attacker to exploit this by sending crafted data to execute functions within the `fibonacciLibrary` or similar contracts, bypassing any access control, which may result in unauthorized actions or loss of funds.

The `TerocoinToken` contract does not appear to have any unchecked low-level calls, but it does have a vulnerability in the use of arithmetic operations without any checks for integer overflow or underflow, except in functions using `SafeMath`. Specifically, the `calculateFee` function performs arithmetic operations without using `SafeMath`, which can lead to overflow or underflow issues. Although Solidity 0.4.23 does not have built-in overflow/underflow protection, it is crucial to ensure that all arithmetic operations are protected using `SafeMath` or by upgrading to a more recent version of Solidity that has built-in overflow protections. Additionally, since this project is set up using Solidity 0.4.23, using `assert` in `SafeMath` is appropriate, but calculations in `calculateFee` should still be wrapped with `SafeMath` functions to ensure safety.",2201,180,6.781789541244507
29,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the TerocoinToken contract is vulnerable.

The primary vulnerability in the TerocoinToken contract lies in the fact that it calculates fees and updates balances using arithmetic operations without proper safeguards against potential integer overflow or underflow prior to the introduction of Solidity 0.8. However, it's important to note that this version utilizes the `SafeMath` library to mitigate such risks effectively.

Regarding `unchecked`, `low`, `level`, `calls.sol` within the Freebie contract, the vulnerability arises from the use of `adr.call.value(msg.value)(data);` in the `Command` function. This is a low-level call and does not automatically propagate errors or handle return values. If the external call fails, it could lead to unwanted outcomes because the return value of this call is not checked, potentially creating a fail-open condition.

Despite the use of `SafeMath` in the TerocoinToken contract, you should always ensure that any updates to Solidity or the context in which this contract operates continue to maintain its security integrity. It is crucial to perform regular audits and adapt the code to accommodate best practices and language upgrades.",1778,228,5.011390686035156

It does handle arithmetic operations safely, though, using the `SafeMath` library.

The key vulnerability present in the first contract is the use of `send` without checking the return value, which is not directly shown in the TerocoinToken contract.

32,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability comes from the use of the low-level `send` function without checking its return value. There are two instances in the contract where the `send` function is used:

1. In the `cash` function at line 109: The code uses `winner.send(subpot);`. If the `send` function fails, it will return `false`, but the code does not check the return value. This can lead to a scenario where funds are not sent to the winner, but the contract still marks the `subpotIndex` as paid (`rounds[roundIndex].isCashed[subpotIndex] = true`), effectively causing a loss of funds for the winner.

2. In the fallback function at line 141: The code uses `msg.sender.send(msg.value-value);`. Similarly to the previous instance, if the `send` function fails and returns `false`, the contract does not revert or handle this failure, potentially leading to a situation where the sender does not receive their expected refund. 

To remedy these vulnerabilities, it is recommended to use the `""transfer""` function, which automatically reverts on failure, or manually check the return value of `send` and handle errors appropriately.",3193,253,7.76177453994751
33,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the unsafe use of low-level calls. In the `ReturnValue` contract, the function `callnotchecked` uses a low-level call (`callee.call()`) without checking the return value. This allows the code to continue even if the call fails, potentially leading to unintended outcomes or fail-opens. Low-level calls such as `.call()` do not throw an exception when they fail; instead, they return a boolean indicating success or failure. If the return value is not checked, it can lead to erroneous behavior if the call fails.

This call does not check if the operation was successful, which can lead to potential security issues. If the call fails, the contract will continue execution without reverting, leaving the contract state inconsistent.

Like the previous example, this call does not check the return value to confirm the transfer succeeded, potentially causing issues if the transfer fails (e.g., if the target address is a contract with a non-default fallback function that does not allow funds to be received).

Failing to check the return values of these low-level calls can result in the contract behaving unpredictably if the operations fail, as the state changes may not align with expectations or dependencies.

However, the second contract `TerocoinToken` does not inherently have this vulnerability related to unchecked low-level calls, as it doesn't utilize `call()` or similar functions. Nevertheless, the focus should be on ensuring proper use of functions and protection against other common vulnerabilities such as reentrancy or gas limit issues.",1570,150,4.916224956512451
57,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of the low-level call function:

1. **Unchecked Low-Level Call**: In the `Proxy` contract, the `proxy` function uses `target.call.value(msg.value)(data);`. The return value of this call is not checked for success or failure. This is a common vulnerability in smart contracts as the call might fail, but the transaction would still continue executing, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or loss of funds. Attackers can exploit this by causing the call to fail and still manipulate the execution flow of the contract.

Always check the return value of low-level calls and handle failures appropriately to prevent such vulnerabilities.",1778,140,3.1027252674102783
58,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the vulnerability in the provided smart contract code comes from the use of low-level `call()` in the `airdrop` contract to invoke the `transferFrom` function without checking the return value. This unchecked low-level call can lead to several issues:

1. **Unchecked Return Value**: The `caddress.call(id, from, _tos[i], v);` line makes a low-level call which returns a boolean value indicating success or failure. If this return value is not checked, it may silently fail, meaning that even if the call does not succeed (e.g., due to lack of gas or other reasons), the loop will continue without reverting the transaction. This means tokens can be reported as transferred when they are not, leading to inconsistencies and potential exploitation.

2. **Security Risks**: If the call fails, the function can continue to execute for the other addresses in `_tos`, which may lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities if not handled properly. It opens up the possibility to accidentally (or maliciously) omit transfers without notifying users or other systems that rely on the `transfer` function's integrity.

To address these issues, each `call()` in the loop should check and handle the return value appropriately, reverting the transaction on failure to ensure accuracy and consistency in token transfers.",1558,263,5.0756824016571045

This low-level call does not check the return value of the call. As mentioned, call(), send(), and other low-level functions return a boolean indicating success or failure but do not halt execution or propagate errors. This can lead to potential fail-open conditions where the transaction may not execute as expected, and errors are silently ignored.

This could allow the attacker to execute a transfer before the original allowance is set, potentially leading to an unauthorized transfer of tokens. 

Additionally, the `approve` function does not include mechanisms such as the ""increase allowance"" or ""decrease allowance"" functions that may help prevent some forms of race conditions associated with front-running vulnerabilities in token approvals.

2. **Line 18: `uint256 y = salt * block.number / (salt % 5);`** - The `block.number` is another public value that is highly predictable, as it is known to everyone within the network.

3. **Line 20: `uint256 seed = block.number / 3 + (salt % 300) + y;`** - Again, this derives a seed from predictable values (`block.number` and `salt`), making it susceptible to guessability.

The given code generally safeguards against arithmetic issues with the use of the SafeMath library, but the vulnerability lies in cases where external calls are involved and when state changes are not properly sequenced or protected. Since no such mismanaged external call appears in the outlined code snippets, the explicit vulnerability isn't present here. However, if such external calls were involved directly or indirectly in balance updates without proper sequence (such as prior updating of the state), that scenario would indeed make it susceptible to reentrancy.

For clarity, in the PrivateBank contract, the vulnerability is evident because of the call to `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which sends funds before updating the balance, making it vulnerable to reentrancy.",1915,204,5.070078372955322
121,reentrancy,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. In the `Collect` function, the line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())` sends ether to the caller using a low-level call. This allows the caller to initiate further calls to the contract before the contract state is updated, specifically before `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;` reduces the caller's balance. An attacker could exploit this by repeatedly calling the `Collect` function to withdraw more funds than they are entitled to, effectively draining the contract.",2067,108,3.200988531112671
122,reentrancy,"YES

The TerocoinToken contract is not vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because it does not involve any external calls that could trigger reentrancy. However, the `Private_Bank` contract is vulnerable due to the reentrancy issue in its `CashOut` function. This vulnerability occurs at the line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())
```

This call allows for reentrancy as it sends Ether to an external address (`msg.sender`) using a lower-level call without updating the balance first. Therefore, an attacker could craft a malicious contract that repeatedly calls the `CashOut` function before the initial execution of balance decrements, draining funds from the `Private_Bank` contract.",1929,148,5.52717924118042
123,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function where it calls `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. This line sends ether to an external address and does not follow best practices to update the state before making the external call. An attacker can exploit this by re-entering the `Collect` function before the balance is deducted, potentially draining the contract of its funds.",2025,88,3.346623420715332
124,reentrancy,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `PrivateBank` contract's `CashOut` function. The line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())` uses a low-level `call` function to send Ether to the `msg.sender`. This can lead to a reentrancy attack because state changes to `balances[msg.sender]` are made after the Ether transfer. An attacker could exploit this by recursively calling `CashOut` within their fallback function to withdraw more funds than they are entitled to, draining the contract's balance before their own balance is updated.",1915,113,3.16076397895813
125,reentrancy,"YES

The given smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack due to the use of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` in the `Collect` function. This line allows the calling contract to reenter before the state has been updated, specifically before `balances[msg.sender] -= _am;` is executed. An attacker could exploit this by recursively calling `Collect` to drain funds from the contract before their balance is reduced.",2069,89,2.809321165084839
126,reentrancy,NO,1527,1,0.8402602672576904
127,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the reliance on `block.timestamp` in the `isSaleFinished` function of the `TimedCrowdsale` contract. Since miners have some control over the block timestamp, they can manipulate it to trigger the sale to finish earlier or later than intended. Using block timestamps for critical logic like determining the end of a sale introduces a potential point of exploitation due to the miner's ability to influence the timestamp within a certain range.",1435,97,2.9029722213745117

129,time manipulation,NO,1838,1,0.9685418605804443
130,time manipulation,"YES. The vulnerability is related to the reliance on the `now` keyword in the `Roulette` contract, which is equivalent to `block.timestamp`. This makes the contract susceptible to timestamp manipulation, as miners can slightly alter the block's timestamp to their advantage, depending on the incentive. This can affect the condition `if(now % 15 == 0)`, potentially allowing a malicious miner to drain the contract's balance by adjusting the timestamp to meet this condition.",1537,94,5.637352466583252
131,time manipulation,"YES

The vulnerability in the EtherLotto contract lies in its use of the block timestamp to generate randomness. The line `var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;` uses `block.timestamp` to create a pseudo-random number, which is susceptible to manipulation. Miners have the capability to alter the block timestamp slightly, potentially allowing them to influence the outcome of the random number generation. This vulnerability can potentially be exploited to predict the result of the lottery, thereby compromising the fairness of the EtherLotto contract.",1647,109,3.4609882831573486

133,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. In the first contract, `DosGas`, the `emptyCreditors` function attempts to clear the `creditorAddresses` array when its length exceeds 1500. However, resetting such a large array (`creditorAddresses = new address[](0)`) could potentially exceed the block gas limit, especially if executed multiple times, rendering the contract unusable as this function may fail due to being too gas-intensive. This effectively creates a Denial of Service (DoS) condition by making it impossible for the contract to reach the line setting `win = true`. As for the second contract, `TerocoinToken`, it appears well-structured with no immediate gas or DoS vulnerabilities apparent in the presented logic, benefiting from the use of `SafeMath` to prevent arithmetic issues.",1663,166,6.984880685806274
134,denial of service,NO,1763,1,0.9695751667022705
135,denial of service,"YES, the given smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability, specifically a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, lies in the way funds are attempted to be sent through the use of `send` in functions like `lendGovernmentMoney`. If one of the recipients is a contract that does not handle `send` properly, it can cause this function to fail, preventing any subsequent creditors from being paid out. 

Additionally, in the `lendGovernmentMoney` function, if an attacker strategically controls the last creditor address with a non-receiving contract (which means the contract cannot accept payment since the fallback function does not exist or has another way of failing), it would cause the failure of `creditorAddresses[creditorAddresses.length - 1].send(profitFromCrash);`, leading to a halt in the normal operation and locking of the funds.

Furthermore, resetting creditor arrays to zero directly after payouts on a first-call basis (per round) means this vulnerability could additionally be exploited to prevent certain payouts from being processed if a small `msg.value` is used in multiple calls causing returns before payouts finalization.",2737,225,4.8416831493377686
136,denial of service,NO,1646,1,0.8405005931854248
137,denial of service,"YES, the contract is vulnerable to a denial of service. 

In the provided `DosOneFunc` smart contract, the denial of service occurs due to the `ifillArray` function. The line `for(uint i=0;i<350;i++) { listAddresses.push(msg.sender); }` could potentially cause the contract to run out of gas. When attempting to add 350 addresses to the `listAddresses` array, if the gas limit is exceeded, the transaction would fail and could prevent other users from interacting with the contract effectively, thereby leading to a denial of service situation.

However, in the `TerocoinToken` contract, there are no elements indicating an immediate denial of service vulnerability like the one in `DosOneFunc`. The use of `SafeMath` and the structure of functions are designed to prevent common vulnerabilities, including arithmetic issues and incorrect balance updates, without apparent operations that would cause excessive gas consumption or infinite loops leading to service denial.",1540,195,4.994419574737549
