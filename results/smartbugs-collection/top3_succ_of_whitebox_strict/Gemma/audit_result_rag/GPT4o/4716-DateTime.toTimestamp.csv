An attacker could exploit this by recursively calling the `CashOut` function to drain the contract's funds before the balance is updated.",1799,110,3.4304654598236084
120,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `CashOut` function, specifically at the line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())`. This line allows an external contract to call back into the `CashOut` function before the contract's state is updated (i.e., before `balances[msg.sender] -= _am;` is executed). An attacker could exploit this by repeatedly calling `CashOut` to drain the contract's funds before the balance is correctly updated.",1701,107,7.292274713516235
121,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function, specifically in the line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())`.

123,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function, specifically at the line where `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` is used. This line allows an external contract to call back into the `Collect` function before the contract's state is updated (i.e., before `acc.balance -= _am;` is executed).

126,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function, where the contract sends Ether to `msg.sender` using a low-level call before updating the user's balance. This allows an attacker to re-enter the `withdrawBalance` function and withdraw funds multiple times before the balance is set to zero.",1313,73,2.454728841781616
127,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `isSaleFinished` function, which relies on `block.timestamp` to determine if the sale is finished. Since `block.timestamp` can be influenced by miners, it can be manipulated to prematurely end the sale or extend it beyond the intended time. This reliance on `block.timestamp` for critical functionality makes the contract susceptible to time manipulation attacks.",1217,86,3.0684187412261963
128,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the use of `now` (an alias for `block.timestamp`) in the `payOut` function and the use of `block.timestamp` in the `randomGen` function. Both instances rely on the block timestamp, which can be manipulated by miners within a certain range, leading to potential exploitation of the contract's logic.",1452,82,2.142331600189209
129,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` in the `resetInvestment` function. The contract relies on `block.timestamp` to determine if enough time has passed since the last investment to allow the `resetInvestment` function to be executed. However, `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners within a certain range, which can be exploited to either delay or prematurely trigger the `resetInvestment` function. This time manipulation can be used by an attacker to gain an unfair advantage, such as ensuring they are the last investor before the jackpot is reset.",1622,121,2.3551151752471924
130,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the reliance on the `now` (or `block.timestamp`) for critical functionality, specifically in the fallback function. The contract checks if `now` is not equal to `pastBlockTime` and then updates `pastBlockTime` to `now`. This allows a miner to manipulate the block timestamp to influence the outcome of the condition `if(now % 15 == 0)`, potentially allowing them to win the balance of the contract by setting a favorable timestamp. This is a classic example of time manipulation vulnerability.",1319,117,7.677612066268921
131,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` to generate randomness in the `play` function. The line `var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;` uses the block timestamp to generate a random number, which can be manipulated by miners. Miners have the ability to influence the block timestamp within a certain range, allowing them to potentially manipulate the outcome of the random number generation and exploit the contract.",1429,97,2.672774076461792
132,short addresses,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to short address attacks. The vulnerability lies in the `sendCoin` function, which takes an `address` and a `uint` as parameters. If a client encodes these arguments incorrectly due to a short address, the EVM will still accept the transaction, potentially leading to incorrect values being processed. This is a client-side issue that can be mitigated by ensuring that clients properly pad arguments, but it is also advisable to implement checks within the smart contract to prevent such vulnerabilities.",1479,105,2.627187967300415
133,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `emptyCreditors` function. When the `creditorAddresses` array grows beyond 1500 elements, the function attempts to reset the array by creating a new empty array. However, this operation can consume a significant amount of gas, especially if the array is large, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. As a result, the transaction could fail, making it impossible to execute the `emptyCreditors` function and effectively causing a denial of service for this functionality.",1444,114,2.5552539825439453
134,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability in the given smart contract code is a potential denial of service (DoS) due to the unbounded loop in the `insertNnumbers` function. The loop iterates `numbers` times, and if `numbers` is large, it can consume a significant amount of gas, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. This would cause the transaction to fail, making it impossible to insert a large number of elements into the array in a single transaction. Additionally, dynamically increasing the array length within the loop can also lead to high gas consumption, further exacerbating the DoS risk.",1544,121,2.8619539737701416
135,denial of service,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the way the contract resets the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays to new empty arrays (lines 46 and 48 in the first contract, and the same lines in the second contract). This operation can be costly in terms of gas if the arrays are large, potentially leading to a situation where the transaction runs out of gas and fails. This would prevent the contract from resetting properly and could block further operations, effectively causing a denial of service. Additionally, if the `send` operations fail (e.g., due to exceeding the gas limit for a single transaction), it could also lead to a DoS situation.",2520,151,4.396642446517944
136,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function, specifically in the line `require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));`. If the `send` operation fails for any address in the `refundAddresses` array, the entire transaction will revert, preventing any subsequent refunds from being processed. This means that a single failure can block all refunds, effectively causing a denial of service for the refund process.",1427,101,2.7800090312957764
137,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function, specifically in the loop that iterates 350 times to push the `msg.sender` address into the `listAddresses` array. As the array grows, the gas required to execute this function increases, potentially reaching the block gas limit and causing the function to fail. This can prevent the contract from functioning as intended, leading to a denial of service.",1323,97,2.345907211303711
138,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability in the given smart contract code is similar to the first example. The `bid` function contains a potential denial of service vulnerability due to the use of `currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid)`. If the current frontrunner is a contract that has a fallback function which consumes more than the allotted 2300 gas or reverts the transaction, the `send` operation will fail. This will cause the `require` statement to fail, preventing any new bids from being accepted and effectively causing a denial of service for the auction. This vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious frontrunner to block other participants from placing bids.",1314,132,3.6707403659820557
