132,short addresses,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to short address attacks. The vulnerability lies in the `sendCoin` function, which takes an `address` and a `uint` as parameters. If a client encodes these arguments incorrectly due to a short address, the EVM will still accept the transaction, potentially leading to incorrect values being processed. This is a client-side issue that can be mitigated by ensuring that clients properly pad arguments, but it is also advisable to implement checks within the smart contract to prevent such vulnerabilities.",short addresses,3.0,632.0,7.0,0.9949772357940674
133,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `emptyCreditors` function.

However, this operation can consume a significant amount of gas, especially if the array is large, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. As a result, the transaction could fail, making it impossible to execute the `emptyCreditors` function and effectively causing a denial of service for this functionality.",denial of service,3.0,642.0,7.0,0.8454849720001221
134,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability in the given smart contract code is a potential denial of service (DoS) due to the unbounded loop in the `insertNnumbers` function. The loop iterates `numbers` times, and if `numbers` is large, it can consume a significant amount of gas, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. This would cause the transaction to fail, making it impossible to insert a large number of elements into the array in a single transaction. Additionally, dynamically increasing the array length within the loop can also lead to high gas consumption, further exacerbating the DoS risk.",denial of service,3.0,649.0,7.0,1.013052225112915
135,denial of service,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the way the contract resets the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays to new empty arrays (lines 46 and 48 in the first contract, and the same lines in the second contract). This operation can be costly in terms of gas if the arrays are large, potentially leading to a situation where the transaction runs out of gas and fails. This would prevent the contract from resetting properly and could block further operations, effectively causing a denial of service. Additionally, if the `send` operations fail (e.g., due to exceeding the gas limit for a single transaction), it could also lead to a DoS situation.",denial of service,3.0,679.0,7.0,0.8400235176086426
136,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function, specifically in the line `require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]]));`.

137,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function, specifically in the loop that iterates 350 times to push the `msg.sender` address into the `listAddresses` array.

This can prevent the contract from functioning as intended, leading to a denial of service.",denial of service,3.0,625.0,7.0,1.2951254844665527
138,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability in the given smart contract code is similar to the first example. The `bid` function contains a potential denial of service vulnerability due to the use of `currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid)`. If the current frontrunner is a contract that has a fallback function which consumes more than the allotted 2300 gas or reverts the transaction, the `send` operation will fail. This will cause the `require` statement to fail, preventing any new bids from being accepted and effectively causing a denial of service for the auction. This vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious frontrunner to block other participants from placing bids.",denial of service,3.0,660.0,7.0,0.7667067050933838
