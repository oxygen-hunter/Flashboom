The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function. It allows any existing owner to assign themselves as the owner of a new address without restrictions. This means any owner can add arbitrary addresses as new owners, which could lead to unauthorized access or abuse of the contract's privileged functions.

12,access control,"YES

The contract is vulnerable because the constructor function is named `missing` instead of using the standard `constructor` keyword. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, if a function has the same name as the contract, it is treated as a constructor. However, in this case, the contract uses Solidity version 0.4.24, and it does follow the old convention. But since Solidity allows the function to be called by anyone, any user can call the `missing()` function and set themselves as the owner, which leads to an access control vulnerability. This would allow an attacker to gain control of the contract and withdraw all funds.",909,133,10.388346910476685
13,access control,"YES, the vulnerability lies in the constructor function `DynamicPyramid()`. In Solidity version 0.4.15, constructor functions are not explicitly named as `constructor` but instead have the same name as the contract (`Rubixi` in this case).

14,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function. The condition `require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);` should instead be `require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);`.

15,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is due to the fact that the function `IamMissing()` is a public function that can be called by anyone. When called, it sets the `owner` variable to `msg.sender`. This allows anyone to become the owner of the contract and gain control over the `withdraw()` function, which can then be used to transfer all the funds in the contract to the attacker's address.

2. However, this call to an external contract (or to the userâ€™s fallback function) happens before the contract updates the state by subtracting the balance (`balances[msg.sender] -= _amount`).
3. If the sender is a contract, it can make a recursive call to `withdraw` before the balance is updated. This allows the attacker to repeatedly withdraw funds without reducing the contract's balance, draining the contract's funds in the process.

The smart contract is vulnerable due to the use of `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) in line 13 and the reliance on `block.timestamp` in the random number generation function on line 27. These values can be manipulated by miners, leading to potential exploits such as time manipulation and bad randomness.",1091,65,7.247871398925781
129,time manipulation,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable because it relies on `block.timestamp` to control the timing of when an investor can reset the investment (in `resetInvestment()` function). Since miners can manipulate the block timestamp slightly, this creates the potential for an attacker to reset the investment earlier or later than intended, leading to a time manipulation vulnerability.",1259,68,7.490223169326782
130,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability arises from the reliance on `now` (which is an alias for `block.timestamp`). Miners can manipulate the block timestamp, which creates a potential exploit. Specifically, in line 18, `require(now != pastBlockTime)` relies on the `now` variable, and in line 20, `pastBlockTime = now;` records the timestamp. This introduces a risk of time manipulation by miners, allowing them to potentially exploit the contract's conditions (e.g., triggering the payout if `now % 15 == 0`).",958,119,11.07597804069519
131,time manipulation,"YES. 

The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` for randomness generation at line 43: `var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;`. Since `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners within certain bounds, this makes the randomness predictable and subject to manipulation, making the contract vulnerable to attacks that exploit this predictability to influence game outcomes.",1068,78,6.098477125167847
132,short addresses,"YES. 

It is vulnerable to a short address attack because the `sendCoin` function does not properly validate the length of the `address` parameter, potentially allowing an attacker to exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed addresses.",1116,44,4.369566917419434
133,denial of service,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in lines 16-18:
```solidity
if(creditorAddresses.length>1500) {
    creditorAddresses = new address ;
    win = true;
}
```
When the `creditorAddresses` array length exceeds 1500, the contract attempts to reset the array by creating a new empty array and sets `win` to true. If an attacker repeatedly calls `addCreditors` to push the array length over 1500, the gas cost for resetting the array becomes very high. This can make the `emptyCreditors` function fail due to exceeding the block gas limit, effectively causing a denial of service as the function can no longer be executed successfully.",1084,159,13.580248832702637
134,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the use of dynamically resizing the array within a loop (lines 18-22). Specifically, in `array.length += 1;`, each iteration requires modifying the array size, which can lead to excessive gas consumption, potentially causing a denial of service. An attacker could exploit this by passing a large value for `numbers`, causing the contract to run out of gas and fail execution. This is a typical gas exhaustion vulnerability leading to denial of service.",1184,96,6.197391510009766
135,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability arises from the lines:

1. **Line 46: `creditorAddresses = new address ;`**
2. **Line 48: `creditorAmounts = new uint ;`**

These lines reset the arrays `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` to empty arrays, which can be exploited in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by preventing future creditors from being properly tracked or reimbursed. Moreover, if a creditor has not been fully paid out before this reset happens, the system will lose track of them, effectively locking them out of receiving further payments. This can block the entire function of the contract, leading to a denial of service.",2158,146,11.933452606201172
136,denial of service,"YES. It is vulnerable because the `send` function only forwards 2300 gas, which might not be enough if the recipient is a contract that has a fallback function requiring more gas. If one of the `send` calls fails, the entire `refundAll` function will revert due to the `require` statement, resulting in a denial of service for the other recipients waiting for refunds.",1067,79,7.108719348907471
137,denial of service,"YES, the contract is vulnerable due to the possibility of a **Denial of Service (DoS) attack**.

The vulnerability is caused by the loop at line 17 (`for(uint i=0;i<350;i++) {`) and the `listAddresses.push(msg.sender)` operation at line 18. Since the contract allows repeatedly adding addresses to the `listAddresses` array up to a length of 1500, the gas required to execute the function will increase as the array grows larger. Eventually, the gas cost may become too high for the function to complete, causing it to fail and potentially rendering the contract unusable or ""frozen,"" which is a form of denial of service.",961,141,11.58149266242981
138,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because it uses `currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid)` to transfer funds. The `.send()` function only forwards a limited amount of gas (2,300 gas), and if the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that consumes more gas than this limit allows, the transfer will fail. This would prevent the contract from proceeding, creating a denial of service, as no other bidders would be able to place a bid.",954,95,10.044045448303223
