The second contract is vulnerable to a front-running attack, similar to the first one.

The vulnerability is present in the same part of the code as before:

The contract is vulnerable due to the same issues present in the first contract. The arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, and subtraction) involving `count` can cause overflows and underflows in lines 28 (`count += input`), 34 (`count *= input`), and 40 (`count -= input`).

91,bad randomness,"YES

The vulnerability exists in the same location as the previous contract:

1. `block.coinbase` (line 99)
2. `msg.sender` (line 101)

The vulnerability lies in the `rand` function. It uses the `block.blockhash` of the previous block as a source of randomness, which is predictable.

134,denial of service,"YES. The vulnerability still exists due to the use of dynamic array resizing in the `insertNnumbers` function (lines 18-22). The repeated resizing of the array (`array.length += 1;`) can lead to excessive gas consumption, potentially causing a denial of service by running out of gas during execution. This can make the contract unusable when large numbers are inserted into the array.",denial of service,3.0,514.0,6.0,2.9370272159576416
135,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in lines 46 and 48, where the arrays `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` are reset to new empty arrays. If the contract is unable to process a creditor payout, this leads to a denial of service (DoS), as the contract may be unable to continue processing other creditors, effectively stopping further operations. This resets crucial tracking data, which could prevent subsequent payments or interactions from occurring as expected.",denial of service,3.0,525.0,6.0,2.6525611877441406

137,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable due to the same reason as the first one. The vulnerability lies in the potential denial of service caused by excessive gas consumption. Specifically, the loop in the `ifillArray` function (lines 26-28) can result in a denial of service if the gas limit is exceeded when trying to add addresses to the `listAddresses` array.",denial of service,3.0,511.0,6.0,3.514173746109009
138,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability is still present in the second contract because the line `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` can cause a denial of service. If the current frontrunner is a contract with a fallback function that consumes all gas or reverts the transaction, the auction contract will be unable to send the bid back, thus preventing further bids. This is a classic denial of service attack vector in Ethereum contracts.",denial of service,3.0,520.0,6.0,3.7295053005218506
