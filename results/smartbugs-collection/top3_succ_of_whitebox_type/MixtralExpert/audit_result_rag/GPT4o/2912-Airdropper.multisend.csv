16,access control,"YES, the smart contract code is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability lies in the function `withdraw()` of the `Map` contract and the `multisend()` function of the `Airdropper` contract:

1. In the `Map` contract, the `withdraw()` function uses `require(msg.sender == owner)` to restrict access. However, since `owner` is a public variable and there is no mechanism preventing unauthorized modifications of ownership, attackers could potentially exploit a related contract or vulnerability to gain ownership and execute this function.

2. The `multisend()` function in the `Airdropper` contract has an access control vulnerability, as it uses the `onlyOwner` modifier. If the `Ownable` contract's ownership can be transferred or manipulated, an attacker can call `multisend()` to perform unauthorized token transfers.

These access control vulnerabilities can be exploited to bypass restrictions and compromise the security of the contracts.",1188,189,11.153103351593018

The vulnerability lies in the unchecked `send()` calls in the `KingOfTheEtherThrone` contract, as identified earlier in lines 110, 118, 132, and 174, where `msg.sender.send()` and `currentMonarch.etherAddress.send()` are used without checking the return values. The issue with using `send()` is that it may fail, but this failure will not revert the transaction unless explicitly handled.

The `send` function in Solidity is a low-level call that only forwards 2300 gas, which may be insufficient for complex fallback functions. More critically, it does not automatically revert the transaction on failure.

This can lead to unexpected outcomes, such as the contract continuing to operate as if the transfer succeeded when it actually failed, creating potential security issues.",1233,88,6.332964181900024
72,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the use of the low-level `call` function on line 14 of the `Proxy` contract, which doesn't check the return value. This can lead to issues like reentrancy attacks or fail-open scenarios, as `call` does not revert the transaction if it fails. Instead, it returns `false`, and since the result is unchecked, the execution continues, potentially leading to unintended consequences.",1403,86,6.513766050338745

74,front running,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is related to front-running, similar to the original contract. Specifically, the `solve` function in the `FindThisHash` contract is still using the line:

```solidity
require(hash == sha3(solution));

This allows attackers to observe the solution being submitted on-chain and front-run the transaction by submitting their own transaction with a higher gas fee. This enables them to steal the reward (1000 ether) by preempting the original transaction.",1174,102,7.052746057510376
75,front running,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function, which allows the owner to transfer tokens to multiple recipients. Since this function does not include any form of protection against front-running attacks, a malicious actor could observe a multisend transaction and preemptively execute a transaction with higher gas fees, thus front-running and potentially manipulating the intended outcome.

In particular, since there is no protection mechanism (e.g., nonce or signature) to prevent the replay of transactions, front-running attacks could occur, especially when large numbers of tokens are distributed in this way.",2248,119,8.123873949050903
76,front running,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `play` function of the `OddsAndEvens` contract. Similar to the first version, this contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks. Since the players' numbers are publicly recorded on the blockchain before the winner is determined, a malicious user could observe the first player's move and then call the `play` function with a number that guarantees their win.

The vulnerability lies in the arithmetic operation in the original `Overflow_Add` contract (`balance += deposit`), which is susceptible to an integer overflow if `balance` and `deposit` exceed the maximum limit of a uint256 variable. In Solidity version 0.4.25, arithmetic operations do not have overflow checks by default. This could result in unexpected behavior or potential exploitation, leading to a drastic change in the `balance` value beyond its intended maximum.

93,bad randomness,"YES, the contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `rand` function, specifically how randomness is generated. The contract attempts to generate a random number by using the previous block's hash (`block.blockhash(lastBlockNumber)`), which is a predictable value.

The vulnerability is due to the same issue as in the original contract: the use of `block.blockhash(block.number - 1)` and `now` to generate the ""random"" number in the `GuessTheRandomNumberChallenge` contract. These values can be manipulated or predicted, making the randomness weak and allowing malicious actors to exploit the system.",1195,72,6.74812126159668

These values are predictable and can be manipulated by miners, making the random number generation insecure. Specifically:

- `block.timestamp` (line 12) can be influenced by miners within a certain range.
- `block.number` (line 18 and 20) is also predictable, as it increments steadily.
- `blockhash(seed)` (line 22) is not secure for generating randomness, as it only works reliably for recent blocks and can be predicted or manipulated.

The `supportsToken` modifier calls an external contract (in this case, the `Bank` contract or the `attack` contract). In the `attack` contract's implementation of `supportsToken`, a reentrant call is made to the `airDrop` function before the first call is completed.

The vulnerability is a gas limit issue in the `emptyCreditors()` function of the `DosGas` contract. Specifically, resetting the `creditorAddresses` array when its length exceeds 1500 could consume excessive gas, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. This would prevent the function from completing successfully, leading to a denial of service.

Additionally, in the `Airdropper` contract, the `multisend()` function uses a loop to transfer tokens to multiple recipients.

The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function. The contract dynamically increases the array size by extending `array.length` within a loop, which can result in excessive gas consumption when the array becomes very large.
