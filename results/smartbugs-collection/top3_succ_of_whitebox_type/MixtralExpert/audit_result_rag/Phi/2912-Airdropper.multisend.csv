11,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `newOwner` function of the `MultiOwnable` contract. The issue is that the `newOwner` function allows any user to become an owner of the contract by calling it, without any checks to ensure that the user has the necessary permissions or ownership rights.

In the `newOwner` function, the `require` statement checks if the `_owner` address is not zero, but it does not check if the caller has the necessary permissions to change the ownership. This means that any user can call the `newOwner` function and become an owner of the contract, which is a serious access control vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, the `newOwner` function should be modified to include a check that ensures that the caller has the necessary permissions to change the ownership. This can be done by adding a `onlyOwner` modifier to the `newOwner` function, similar to the `deleteOwner` function. This will ensure that only the current owner of the contract can call the `newOwner` function and change the ownership.",1128,236,10.509145498275757
12,access control," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. The issue is that the `ERC20` token contract's `transfer` function is called without using the SafeMath library to prevent integer overflow and underflow. This can lead to vulnerabilities where an attacker can manipulate the `values` array to cause an integer underflow, potentially allowing them to withdraw more tokens than intended.

To fix this vulnerability, the SafeMath library should be used when performing arithmetic operations, such as in the `multisend` function:

```solidity
function multisend(address _tokenAddr, address[] dests, uint256[] values)
    onlyOwner
    returns (uint256) {
        uint256 i = 0;

           i += 1;
        }
        return(i);
    }

This line allows the `withdraw` function to be called by any user, not just the owner of the wallet. An attacker could exploit this by calling the `withdraw` function with a large amount, potentially draining the wallet's balance.

To fix this vulnerability, the `withdraw` function should be modified to include an access control mechanism, such as the `onlyOwner` modifier from the `Ownable` contract. This would ensure that only the owner of the wallet can withdraw funds.

The vulnerability lies in the line:

```solidity
ERC20(_tokenAddr).transfer(dests[i], values[i]);
```

The `transfer` function in the `ERC20` contract is a high-level function that automatically checks for errors and reverts the transaction if the transfer fails. However, the `transfer` function internally uses a low-level call to the `call` function of the underlying Ethereum contract. If the `call` function fails and returns false, the `transfer` function will not revert the transaction, leading to a fail-open situation.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the `send` function instead of the `transfer` function, as `send` will revert the transaction if the low-level call fails:

```solidity
ERC20(_tokenAddr).send(dests[i], values[i]);

The vulnerability lies in the ERC20 contract's transfer function, which uses the low-level call function to transfer tokens:

```solidity
ERC20(_tokenAddr).transfer(dests[i], values[i]);
```

This line is equivalent to:

```solidity
ERC20(_tokenAddr).call(abi.selector(""transfer(address,uint256)"", ""transfer(address,uint256)"", dests[i], values[i]));
```

The issue is that the return value of the call function is not checked. If the call fails, the function will continue to execute, potentially leading to fail-open situations and other unwanted outcomes.

To fix this vulnerability, the return value of the call function should be checked, and the function should revert if the call fails:

```solidity

This line is using the low-level `call` function, which is similar to the `call.value` function in the previous example. The `call` function does not check for errors and will not revert the transaction if an error occurs. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploits.

In this case, if the `call` function fails, the contract will continue to execute, potentially leading to a fail-open situation. This can be exploited by an attacker to drain funds from the contract or cause other unwanted outcomes.

To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use higher-level functions like `transfer` or `send` for sending Ether, and to use `call` only when absolutely necessary, with proper error checking and handling.",2307,214,10.176132202148438

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to unchecked low-level calls. The vulnerability lies in the `sendMoney` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity

This line uses the low-level `call.value` function to send Ether and execute arbitrary code on the `_target` address. The potential issue is that the return value of this function is not checked, which means that if the call fails, the contract will continue to execute without reverting the transaction. This can lead to fail-open situations and unintended outcomes.

To fix this vulnerability, the return value of the `call.value` function should be checked, and the transaction should be reverted if the call fails. Here's an example of how to fix the `sendMoney` function:

The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. Specifically, the issue is with the `ERC20(_tokenAddr).transfer(dests[i], values[i]);` line. The `transfer` function in the ERC20 standard is not a low-level function, but it does not have built-in overflow checks for the `value` parameter. This can lead to a vulnerability if the `values[i]` is too large and causes an overflow.

To fix this issue, you can use the SafeMath library to perform the subtraction operation safely. Here's an updated version of the `multisend` function:

This can lead to front-running attacks where a malicious user can steal the solution to a puzzle or other valuable secret by observing the pending transactions and copying them with higher fees.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a non-transparent function for approving the spender, such as using a private function or a function that does not emit events.

The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. Specifically, the issue is with the line:

```solidity
ERC20(_tokenAddr).transfer(dests[i], values[i]);
```

In Solidity, the `transfer` function of the `ERC20` interface can cause an integer overflow if the value being transferred is greater than the current balance of the token contract. This is because the `transfer` function subtracts the value from the sender's balance and adds it to the receiver's balance. If the sender's balance is close to the maximum value of a uint256 (2^256 - 1), subtracting the value can cause an integer underflow, resulting in an incorrect balance.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the `SafeMath` library's `sub` function to safely subtract the value from the sender's balance before calling the `transfer` function. Here's an updated version of the `multisend` function:

```solidity
uint256 i = 0;
while (i < dests.length) {
   ERC20(_tokenAddr).transfer(dests[i], values[i]);

```

In Solidity, the `uint256` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When performing arithmetic operations on `uint256` variables, if the result exceeds the maximum value of `2^256 - 1`, it will wrap around to zero. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the contract's state.

In the `multisend` function, the `i` variable is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. If an attacker provides an array of `dests` and `values` with a length greater than the maximum value of `uint256`, the `i` variable will overflow and wrap around to zero. This can cause the loop to execute indefinitely, potentially draining the contract's balance or causing other unintended consequences.

Additionally, the `sell` function on line 33 is also vulnerable to integer overflow. When transferring funds back to the sender, if an integer overflow occurs during the multiplication of the number of tokens and the price per token, the transfer may not send the correct amount of Ether, leading to potential loss of funds.

83,arithmetic," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow.

The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. Specifically, the issue is with the line:

```solidity
ERC20(_tokenAddr).transfer(dests[i], values[i]);
```

In Solidity, the `transfer` function of the `ERC20` interface can cause an integer underflow if the value being transferred is greater than the balance of the sender's account. This is because the `transfer` function subtracts the value from the sender's balance, and if the balance is not sufficient, it can result in an underflow.

An integer underflow can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the contract's state, potentially leading to theft or denial of service. To mitigate this vulnerability, the `SafeMath` library should be used for arithmetic operations, as it includes overflow and underflow checks.

To fix the vulnerability, the `multisend` function should be updated to use the `SafeMath` library for the subtraction operation:

```solidity
ERC20(_tokenAddr).transfer(dests[i], SafeMath.sub(balance, values[i]));

```

In Solidity, the `transfer` function of the `ERC20` interface can cause an integer overflow if the value being transferred is greater than the balance of the sender. This is because the `transfer` function subtracts the value from the sender's balance, and if the sender's balance is not large enough to accommodate the subtraction, it can wrap around to a very large number, effectively causing an overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the `SafeMath` library's `sub` function to safely subtract the value from the sender's balance before calling the `transfer` function. Here's an example of how you can modify the `multisend` function to avoid the integer overflow vulnerability:

```solidity
function multisend(address _tokenAddr, address[] dests, uint256[] values)

The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. Specifically, the issue is with the line:

```solidity
ERC20(_tokenAddr).transfer(dests[i], values[i]);
```

In this line, the `transfer` function of the `ERC20` contract is called, which subtracts the `values[i]` amount from the contract's balance. If the `values[i]` amount is greater than the contract's balance, it will cause an integer underflow, leading to an incorrect balance value.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the `SafeMath` library's `sub` function to safely subtract the `values[i]` amount from the contract's balance. Here's an updated version of the `multisend` function:

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow. The vulnerability lies in the functions `overflowaddtostate`, `overflowmultostate`, `underflowtostate`, `overflowlocalonly`, `overflowmulocalonly`, and `underflowlocalonly`. These functions perform arithmetic operations without any checks for overflow or underflow, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential exploits.

For example, in the `overflowaddtostate` function, if the `input` is large enough, it can cause the `count` variable to overflow, wrapping around to a smaller value. Similarly, in the `underflowtostate` function, if the `input` is large enough, it can cause the `count` variable to underflow, wrapping around to a larger value.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library provided in the code, which includes safe arithmetic operations with overflow and underflow checks. You can replace the arithmetic operations in the vulnerable functions with the corresponding SafeMath functions, such as `SafeMath.add`, `SafeMath.mul`, and `SafeMath.sub`.",1058,245,10.370534420013428

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to arithmetic overflows and underflows. The vulnerability lies in the `transfer` function of the `Token` contract, specifically in lines 20 and 22. The `require` statement checks if the sender's balance is greater than or equal to the transfer amount, but it does not prevent an underflow if the sender's balance is exactly equal to the transfer amount. The subtraction operation in line 22 could result in an underflow if the sender's balance is exactly equal to the transfer amount, leading to an incorrect balance state.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library provided in the code snippet. Replace the `transfer` function in the `Token` contract with the following:

In Solidity, the `uint256` type is an unsigned integer, which means it cannot represent negative numbers. When performing arithmetic operations on `uint256` variables, if the result exceeds the maximum value of `2^256 - 1`, it will wrap around to zero. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

In the `multisend` function, the loop iterates over the `dests` and `values` arrays, and for each iteration, it calls the `transfer` function of the `ERC20` contract. If the sum of the `values` array elements exceeds the maximum value of `uint256`, the result will wrap around to zero, which can lead to incorrect balances being transferred and potential vulnerabilities.

121,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 54:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. In this case, the Collect function is vulnerable to reentrancy because it allows the external contract to call the Deposit function before the balance is updated.

Here's a possible attack scenario:

1. An attacker creates a malicious contract that calls the Collect function.
2. The Collect function checks if the balance is greater than or equal to MinSum and _am.
3. If the condition is met, the Collect function calls the msg.sender.call.value(_am)() function.
4. The malicious contract's fallback function is triggered, which calls the Deposit function.
5. The Deposit function adds the value to the attacker's balance.
6. The malicious contract's fallback function is triggered again, and the process repeats.
7. This loop continues until the attacker drains the contract's funds.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance before making the external call, and it should also use the checks-effects-interactions pattern. Here's",1571,301,12.751647233963013
122,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 40:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the `msg.sender` to make a call to the contract before the balance update is completed. If the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract with a fallback function designed to re-enter the contract, it can repeatedly call the `CashOut` function before the balance is updated, draining funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the SafeMath library to perform the balance update before making the external call, or use the checks-effects-interactions pattern to ensure that all state changes are completed before interacting with external contracts.",1397,174,7.91853928565979
123,reentrancy," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in line 29, where the contract allows an external call to be made before the execution of the function is complete:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the `msg.sender` to potentially call the `Collect` function again before the balance is deducted, leading to a reentrancy attack. An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the `Collect` function and then calls another function in the malicious contract, potentially draining funds from the `U_BANK` contract.",1517,142,6.271813869476318
124,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 38:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the `msg.sender` to make a call to the contract before the execution of the `CashOut` function is complete. If the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract with a fallback function designed to call back into the `CashOut` function, it can repeatedly withdraw funds from the contract before the balance is updated, leading to a potential loss of funds.",1381,130,5.94457745552063
125,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack.

The vulnerability lies in line 54:

if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line allows the external contract to make a new call to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. In this case, the function `Collect` is vulnerable to reentrancy because it allows the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` call to be made before updating the balance of the sender.

An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the `Collect` function and then calls another function in the `Collect` function before the balance is updated. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially allow the attacker to drain funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the balance of the sender before making the external call, or use a pattern like checks-effects-interactions to prevent reentrancy attacks.",1573,213,9.211220502853394
126,reentrancy," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `multisend` function of the `Airdropper` contract. The issue is that the contract calls `ERC20(_tokenAddr).transfer` for each recipient without updating the token balance before making the next call. This allows a malicious contract to call back into the `multisend` function before the token balance is updated, potentially draining funds from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should update the token balance before making the transfer calls, or use a reentrancy guard pattern to prevent recursive calls.",825,143,6.159995794296265
127,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the `isSaleFinished()` function of the `TimedCrowdsale` contract, which relies on the `block.timestamp` to determine if the sale is finished. As mentioned in the explanation, the `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners, which can lead to incorrect results for time-based logic in smart contracts.",706,96,4.2409961223602295
128,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation due to the reliance on block.timestamp for both the payOut function and the randomGen function. This can be exploited by miners to manipulate the reported time, potentially affecting the outcome of the contract's logic.",985,63,2.806551218032837
129,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the resetInvestment function, specifically in the line:

if (block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp+ONE_MINUTE) throw;

This line checks if the current block timestamp is less than the last investment timestamp plus one minute. An attacker can exploit this by manipulating the block timestamp to be within the allowed time frame, allowing them to call the resetInvestment function and reset the jackpot and lastInvestor.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a more reliable method to determine the time elapsed since the last investment, such as using block.number or a dedicated time oracle service.",1265,159,6.797929525375366
130,time manipulation," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the lines:

```solidity
require(now!= pastBlockTime);
pastBlockTime = now;
```

These lines ensure that only one transaction per block can successfully execute the `payable` function. However, miners have some leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, which can be manipulated to a certain extent. This means that a miner could potentially delay the execution of the `payable` function by a few seconds, allowing multiple transactions to execute the function within the same block.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who sends multiple transactions with the value of 10 ether to the contract. The attacker can then manipulate the block time to ensure that multiple transactions are executed within the same block, resulting in the attacker receiving multiple payments from the contract.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should not rely on the current block time to determine the eligibility of a transaction to execute the `payable` function. Instead, it should use a more reliable mechanism, such as a counter or a timestamp that is not easily manipulated by miners.",837,264,11.045332670211792
131,time manipulation," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to time manipulation. The vulnerability lies in the same line as the first contract:

var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;

This line uses block.timestamp to generate a random number, which can be manipulated by miners. An attacker with enough hash power could influence the block timestamps to control the outcome of the random number generation, potentially affecting the distribution of winnings in the EtherLotto game.",1051,111,4.783731460571289
132,short addresses," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of the `address` type for the `to` parameter in the `sendCoin` function. The `address` type in Solidity is 20 bytes, which can be padded with leading zeros. This can lead to short address attacks if the contract does not properly handle the padded address.

To fix this issue, the `to` parameter should be changed to the `address payable` type, which is explicitly designed to handle padded addresses. Additionally, the `SafeMath` library should be used for all arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and underflow issues.

Here's the updated `sendCoin` function:

```solidity
function sendCoin(address payable to, uint256 amount) returns(bool sufficient) {
    if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) return false;
    balances[msg.sender] = SafeMath.sub(balances[msg.sender], amount);
    balances[to] = SafeMath.add(balances[to], amount);
    Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
    return true;
}
```

By using `address payable` and `SafeMath`, the vulnerability related to short addresses and arithmetic operations is mitrighted.",1044,298,12.747509956359863
133,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the `emptyCreditors` function. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `emptyCreditors` function can be called repeatedly to keep clearing the `creditorAddresses` array, which can lead to a situation where the contract is unable to process legitimate transactions or calls to other functions that depend on the `creditorAddresses` array.

In the `emptyCreditors` function, if the length of `creditorAddresses` is greater than 1500, the function clears the array by assigning it a new array of length 0. This can be exploited by repeatedly calling the `addCreditors` function to add addresses to the `creditorAddresses` array and then calling the `emptyCreditors` function to clear it. This can lead to a Denial of Service attack, as the contract will be unable to process legitimate transactions or calls to other functions that depend on the `creditorAddresses` array.

To fix this vulnerability, you can add a condition to the `emptyCreditors` function to prevent it from being called repeatedly in a short period of time, or you can implement a mechanism to limit the rate at which the `creditorAddresses` array can be cleared.",1009,284,12.247826337814331
134,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function, specifically in the lines where the contract attempts to dynamically resize the `array` if `numElements` reaches the current length of the `array`.

In Solidity, arrays are fixed-size data structures, and their size cannot be changed after they are initialized. The line `array.length += 1;` is attempting to change the size of the array, which is not allowed and will result in a revert. This can be exploited by repeatedly calling the `insertNnumbers` function with a large number of elements, causing the contract to revert and potentially leading to a denial of service.

To fix this vulnerability, you should initialize the `array` with a fixed size that is sufficient to hold the maximum number of elements you expect to store in it. Alternatively, you can use a dynamic array with a predefined maximum size and handle the case when the array is full by reverting the transaction or returning an error message.",1136,225,10.174158334732056
135,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the contract resets the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays to empty arrays when a new credit cycle starts (line 46 and line 48). This means that all previous creditor addresses and amounts are lost, and the contract cannot process any further transactions until a new credit cycle begins.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the `lendGovernmentMoney` function, which triggers a new credit cycle and resets the arrays. This would effectively prevent legitimate creditors from receiving their funds, as their addresses and amounts would be lost in the reset.

To fix this vulnerability, the contract should not reset the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays to empty arrays when a new credit cycle starts. Instead, it should append new creditor addresses and amounts to the existing arrays, or use a different data structure that can handle dynamic arrays without resetting.",2560,227,10.428745985031128
136,denial of service," YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `refundAll` function, specifically in the line:

```solidity
require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[EE]]);
```

This line attempts to send Ether to the addresses stored in `refundAddresses`. If any of the addresses in `refundAddresses` is not willing to accept the Ether or if there is an issue with the transaction, the `send` function will fail and revert the transaction. Since the `refundAll` function is called in a loop, a single failure will cause the entire function to revert, effectively blocking the refund process for all addresses in the array.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has control over one of the addresses in `refundAddresses`. By simply not accepting the Ether sent to their address, they can prevent the entire refund process from completing, causing a Denial of Service.",1036,232,9.84563159942627
137,denial of service," YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the `ifillArray` function, specifically in the lines where it pushes 350 addresses of the sender into the `listAddresses` array for each call to the function. An attacker can repeatedly call this function, filling up the array and potentially causing the contract to run out of storage space, leading to a DoS condition where the contract becomes unresponsive or fails to execute further functions properly.",854,113,4.903984785079956
138,denial of service," YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the use of the `send` function in line 23. The `send` function is a low-level transfer function that only transfers Ether if the recipient has enough Ether to cover the gas costs. If the recipient does not have enough Ether, the transaction will fail and the contract will not execute the rest of the code, potentially leading to a denial of service.",844,103,4.503928899765015
