The `nameFilter` function is vulnerable to a variety of attacks.  Here's why:

* **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The function doesn't properly validate the input string. It allows arbitrary code execution by accepting any string as input. 
* **Buffer Overflow:** The function doesn't check the length of the input string. This could lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite memory and execute malicious code. 
* **Logic Errors:** The function's logic is flawed and doesn't account for all possible inputs.

The `Collect` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 

Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `if` statement checks for a condition before calling `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` which is an external contract call.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The attacker can call the `Collect` function multiple times within a short period, potentially draining the contract's funds.

The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Call:** The `WithdrawToHolder` function calls an external contract (`_addr`) with a value (`_wei`).
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The external contract call could be reentrant, meaning it could be called again before the first call is complete. 
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** This could lead to an attacker repeatedly calling the `WithdrawToHolder` function, draining funds from the contract.

The `airDrop` function in the `ModifierEntrancy` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `airDrop` function calls another contract (`ModifierEntrancy`) which is vulnerable to reentrancy.
* **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `airDrop` function doesn't have any checks to prevent the attacker from calling it multiple times.

The `nameFilter` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  The function uses a `bytes` array to store the input string.  The function then uses a series of conditional statements to check the validity of the input string.  However, the function does not properly handle the case where an attacker could call the function multiple times in a short period of time.  This could allow an attacker to drain the contract of funds.

The `nameFilter` function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.  Here's why:

* **External Contract Calls:** The `nameFilter` function allows external contracts to call the `nameFilter` function.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  The function's logic doesn't explicitly handle external contract calls, making it susceptible to reentrancy attacks. 
* **Unclear Execution Flow:** The function's logic is complex and doesn't clearly define how it handles external contract calls.
