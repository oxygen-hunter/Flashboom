The use of `send()` is discouraged because it forwards only 2300 gas, which is often insufficient for non-trivial fallback functions, and because it doesn't automatically propagate errors like high-level Solidity functions.

1. **Line 12:** `uint256 private salt = block.timestamp;`
   - Using the block timestamp as a salt is vulnerable because miners can influence the timestamp slightly, making it predictable.

2. **Line 18:** `uint256 y = salt * block.number / (salt % 5);`

   - Using `blockhash` within the range of the last 256 blocks might seem unpredictable but can be influenced by miners or replayed by users submitting transactions at a specific block height.

135,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack.

The vulnerability arises from the way the contract sends funds to creditors. Specifically, the use of `send` to transfer ether to addresses in the `creditorAddresses` array in both the `lendGovernmentMoney` function and the emergency pay-out section. If any of the creditor addresses are contracts that execute code in their fallback function, the `send` will only succeed if the fallback uses less than 2300 gas. If not, the transaction will fail, potentially causing a denial of service for other creditors.

Lines where funds are transferred using `send`:
- `msg.sender.send(amount);`
- `creditorAddresses[creditorAddresses.length - 1].send(profitFromCrash);`
- `creditorAddresses[lastCreditorPayedOut].send(creditorAmounts[lastCreditorPayedOut]);`

If the gas limit is reached while processing this loop, it could prevent the execution of the function, thus causing a denial of service.
