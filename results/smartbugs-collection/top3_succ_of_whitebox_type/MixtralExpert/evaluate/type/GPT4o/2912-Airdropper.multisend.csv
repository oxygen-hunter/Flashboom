The vulnerability lies in the function `withdraw()` of the `Map` contract and the `multisend()` function of the `Airdropper` contract:

However, since `owner` is a public variable and there is no mechanism preventing unauthorized modifications of ownership, attackers could potentially exploit a related contract or vulnerability to gain ownership and execute this function.

2. The `multisend()` function in the `Airdropper` contract has an access control vulnerability, as it uses the `onlyOwner` modifier. If the `Ownable` contract's ownership can be transferred or manipulated, an attacker can call `multisend()` to perform unauthorized token transfers.

134,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the `insertNnumbers` function. The contract dynamically increases the array size by extending `array.length` within a loop, which can result in excessive gas consumption when the array becomes very large. This could potentially cause a denial of service (DoS) attack, as the transaction may run out of gas before completion, especially when a large number of elements are inserted. This creates a vulnerability where the contract can be rendered unusable by artificially increasing gas requirements, preventing further interactions.",denial of service,3.0,536.0,6.0,3.9106037616729736
135,denial of service,"YES. The given smart contract is vulnerable due to a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack in the `lendGovernmentMoney` function. Specifically:

1. **Lines 46 and 48**: The code resets the `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays using `new address ` and `new uint `. This means if an attacker fills up these arrays significantly (making them large), when the contract tries to reset them, the gas required might exceed the block gas limit, resulting in a DoS.

2. **Inability to update state**: If resetting the arrays fails due to exceeding the gas limit, the contract would be unable to continue its operations, leading to a permanent halt, effectively making the contract unusable.",denial of service,3.0,587.0,6.0,3.0708723068237305
136,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability in the given code lies in the same issue found in the first contract: the use of `send()` in the `refundAll()` function. If any of the recipient addresses refuse the transfer (e.g., by having a fallback function that consumes more gas than allowed by `send()`), the entire refund process will fail, causing a denial of service. This can prevent all other recipients from receiving their refunds, making the contract vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack.",denial of service,3.0,531.0,6.0,2.1910059452056885
137,denial of service,"YES, it is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in the provided code is in the **multisend** function of the **Airdropper** contract. Specifically, the **while** loop (`while (i < dests.length)`) can be exploited by providing a very large list of destination addresses (**dests**) and corresponding values (**values**). This could lead to running out of gas, causing the function to fail before completing the transfer to all recipients. This is a type of **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack, where the contract is unable to complete its operations due to gas limits, rendering it unusable in certain situations.",denial of service,3.0,565.0,6.0,2.840649366378784
138,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the same line as the previous code:

```solidity
require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));
```

This line attempts to send Ether back to the previous frontrunner using the `send` method. If the previous frontrunner is a contract, and that contract's fallback function consumes more gas than the provided stipend (2300 gas), the transaction will fail. This would prevent anyone else from bidding, leading to a denial of service (DoS) attack on the auction.",denial of service,3.0,546.0,6.0,3.0913801193237305
