The code has several vulnerabilities:

* **Unchecked Return Values:** The `claimThrone` function doesn't check the return value of `msg.sender.send(valuePaid)`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.
* **Low Level Function Calls:** The `claimThrone` function uses `msg.sender.send(valuePaid)` and `msg.sender.send(excessPaid)`. These functions are low-level and can lead to unexpected behavior. 
* **Unprotected Access:** The `transferOwnership` function is not restricted to the owner. This could allow an attacker to change the contract's ownership. 
* **Reentrancy:** The `claimThrone` function could be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
* **Arithmetic Overflows:** The code does not handle arithmetic overflows and underflows well. 
* **Timestamp Dependence:** The `claimThrone` function uses the block timestamp for critical functionality. This can be manipulated by miners.

The `withdraw` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Here's why:

* **External Call:** The `withdraw` function uses `msg.sender.call.value(amount)()`. This means it's calling an external contract (the `msg.sender` address) with a value.
* **Potential for Reentrancy:**  An attacker could call the `withdraw` function multiple times in rapid succession, potentially draining the contract's funds. 
* **Unclear Execution:** The code doesn't explicitly handle the potential for multiple calls to the `withdraw` function.
