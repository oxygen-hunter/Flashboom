The code uses `call.value` and `gas` to execute functions. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities. 

Here's why:

* **Unpredictable Execution:**  `call.value` and `gas` can lead to unexpected behavior. The execution of the function might not be as expected, and the contract might not handle the return value correctly.
* **Reentrancy Attacks:**  `call.value` can be exploited in a reentrancy attack. An attacker could call the function multiple times, potentially draining the contract's funds.
* **Unchecked Return Values:** The code doesn't check the return values of the functions. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

The vulnerability lies in line 41:             if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line calls the `call.value` function, which can be exploited by an attacker to drain funds from the contract.
