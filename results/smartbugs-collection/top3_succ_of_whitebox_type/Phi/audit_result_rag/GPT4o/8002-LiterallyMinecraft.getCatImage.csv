The vulnerability is in the `MultiOwnable` contract's `newOwner` function. Specifically, it allows any existing owner to assign an arbitrary address as a new owner by simply calling `newOwner` with that address as a parameter. This means that any account that is currently an owner can potentially add unauthorized accounts as new owners, leading to expanded access control without any oversight or hierarchical authorization check beyond the initial owner's ability to assign others. This increases the risk of unauthorized control and potential exploitation, as new owners can be easily and improperly added.",2766,117,2.194695234298706

The vulnerability in the provided smart contract code lies in the constructor function, which is incorrectly defined as a regular function named `missing()` due to a version of Solidity that predates the introduction of the `constructor` keyword. In Solidity 0.4.24, it relies on the function having the same name as the contract to serve as a constructor, but since the function `missing()` is not named `LiterallyMinecraft`, it does not act as a constructor. Consequently, the function can be invoked by anyone, allowing any user to unexpectedly set themselves as the contract's owner and exploit the access control intended only for the actual owner.

The smart contract's vulnerability lies in the `initWallet` function, which is a public function that allows anyone to set the `creator` address to themselves. This means that the creator address, which presumably should be set only once during contract deployment, can be manipulated by any caller who can successfully invoke `initWallet`. As a result, an attacker can take control of the contract by calling `initWallet` and setting themselves as the `creator`. This allows them to subsequently call the `migrateTo` function and move all the contract's funds to an address of their choosing, leading to unauthorized access control and potential loss of funds.

This opens up the contract to access control vulnerabilities because if the `fibonacciLibrary` address is replaced by a malicious contract, that contract can execute arbitrary code with the permissions of `FibonacciBalance`.

2. The fallback function also uses `delegatecall` without any restrictions, meaning any call with arbitrary data can be sent to the `fibonacciLibrary`. This allows an attacker to execute code residing in the `fibonacciLibrary` in the context of the `FibonacciBalance` contract.

1. **`owner2.send(sum2);`**: This line can fail, for example, if the receiving address is a contract that requires more than 2300 gas in its fallback function, potentially resulting in the `send` call failing without refunding `sum2`.

2. **`owner.send(balance);`**: This line can also fail for similar reasons, such as the receiving address being a contract with a more complex fallback function. If `send` fails, the function currently doesnâ€™t handle it, which could result in loss of funds intended for withdrawal.

61,unchecked low level calls,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable due to the use of unchecked low-level calls. Specifically:

1. `firstTarget.call.value(msg.value)();` does not check the return value of the call, which can lead to failure without handling any errors or performing necessary rollback operations.

2. `secondTarget.call.value(msg.value)();` also suffers from the same vulnerability. The call's return value is not checked, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if the call fails.

3. `owner.call.value(1 wei)();` in the `winPrize` function does not check the return value, which can lead to issues if the call fails and is not properly handled.

Unchecked low-level calls can result in loss of funds or other unwanted outcomes because the execution continues even after a failure, and this can be exploited by attackers.",3737,166,2.9074740409851074

This low-level call does not check the return value for success or failure, which can lead to unintended outcomes if the call fails. This behavior can cause the contract to continue its execution even if the called function fails, making it susceptible to fail-open scenarios and possibly leading to the exploitation of the contract.

This low-level call does not automatically propagate errors; instead, it returns a boolean value indicating success or failure. If the return value is not checked, it can lead to situations where the transfer may fail silently without reverting the entire transaction, leaving the contract in an inconsistent state or allowing unwanted outcomes.

66,unchecked low level calls,"YES, the smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerabilities stem from the use of low-level calls, specifically with the `call()` function. These calls do not check the return value, which can lead to execution failures without reverting the transaction:

1. In the `WithdrawToken` function:
   ```solidity
   token.call(bytes4(sha3(""transfer(address,uint256)"")),to,amount);
   ```
   This line of code uses a low-level call to transfer tokens to a specified address. If the call fails, it returns `false`, but the contract does not handle this return value, which can lead to incorrect assumptions about the success of the transfer.

2. In the `WithdrawToHolder` function:
   ```solidity
   _addr.call.value(_wei);
   ```
   This line of code uses a low-level call to send Ether to an address. If the call fails, it returns `false`, but the contract does not check this return value, which can cause Ether to be lost if the transfer fails.

73,front running,"YES, the smart contract code is vulnerable to a front-running attack. The vulnerability exists in the `claimReward` function, where the contract allows an external user to claim a reward based on a specific `submission` parameter. Since the Ethereum network is public, anyone can see pending transactions in the transaction pool. A malicious actor could observe a legitimate transaction attempting to call `claimReward` with a valid submission, and then quickly issue their own transaction with a higher gas fee, effectively 'front-running' the original transaction and claiming the reward for themselves. This is exacerbated by the condition that `claimed` must be `false`, which can be exploited in the window before the legitimate transaction is processed.",2619,140,2.507554292678833
74,front running,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks. The issue lies in the `solve` function where it requires a solution to match a predetermined hash. Since the Ethereum blockchain is public, any pending transaction with the solution can be observed by others. A malicious user can notice this transaction, copy it, and submit it with a higher gas fee to ensure their transaction is processed first. This allows the malicious user to claim the reward of 1000 ether, leaving the original user without any reward. This vulnerability is similar to the one described in the first smart contract and still persists in this code.",2565,121,2.405475378036499
75,front running,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability in the code is related to the approval mechanism, which can lead to front-running attacks. Specifically, the `approve` function allows a user to set an allowance for a spender. This can be exploited if:

1. A user sets a new allowance for a spender and the transaction takes some time to be included in a block.
2. In that time, a malicious spender sees the pending transaction and submits a transaction using the current allowance before the new allowance is set with higher gas fees to get it mined first.
3. This allows the spender to perform a transfer based on the old allowance even when the user intends to change it. 

To mitigate this, it's recommended to use the `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance` methods that adjust allowances incrementally, preventing the above described race condition.

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a front-running attack. The vulnerability lies in the `play` function of the `OddsAndEvens` contract. When a player submits their number via the `play` function, this information is visible in the pending transactions of the Ethereum blockchain. An attacker can observe this transaction and submit their own transaction with a higher gas fee. By doing so, they can ensure that their transaction is processed first, allowing them to pick a number that guarantees a win against the original player.

82,arithmetic,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities. Here's why:

1. **Multiplication in `buy` function:** In the `buy` function, the `require` statement on line 23 `require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);` potentially allows an integer overflow when `numTokens` is large enough that `numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN` exceeds the maximum value of a 256-bit unsigned integer. If an overflow occurs, the result wraps around, allowing a potentially invalid purchase condition to pass.

2. **Addition in `buy` function:** Following the multiplication, when adding to the `balanceOf[msg.sender]` on line 25, there's a risk of integer overflow. This occurs when the aggregation of `numTokens` exceeds the maximum uint256 value, causing it to reset and falsely reflect an incorrect balance.

3. **Multiplication in `sell` function:** Similarly, in the `sell` function on line 33, the multiplication `numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN` can overflow. This can result in an incorrect transfer amount that doesn't reflect the intended ether send, enabling a potential attack where the contract mistakenly transfers an unintended large amount back to the seller.

These vulnerabilities must be addressed by using Solidity's SafeMath library or upgrading to Solidity 0.8.x, where overflow checks are handled natively.",2686,277,4.545583009719849
83,arithmetic,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable to integer underflow due to the operation `count -= input` without any checks. Since `count` is an unsigned integer (`uint256`), reducing its value by `input` without a preemptive check could result in going below zero, leading to an underflow, which sets `count` to an incorrect high value. This type of arithmetic vulnerability was a common issue in earlier Solidity versions before the default behavior of Solidity 0.8, which automatically handles underflows and overflows by reverting transactions.",2472,110,3.1097970008850098
84,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the `run` function where it calculates `uint res = count - input;`.

86,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to arithmetic overflows and underflows. The original functions `overflowaddtostate`, `overflowmultostate`, and `underflowtostate` manipulate the `count` state variable directly with operations that can result in integer overflows and underflows. Likewise, the local operations in `overflowlocalonly`, `overflowmulocalonly`, and `underflowlocalonly` can also result in these vulnerabilities, although they do not alter state variables. In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, arithmetic operations do not automatically check for overflows and underflows, which can lead to unpredictable results, potential financial loss, or exploitation vectors.",2703,139,2.9502015113830566
87,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the potential for integer underflow in the `transfer` function. Specifically, the line `require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);` does not prevent an underflow because in Solidity versions prior to 0.8, unsigned integers wrap around on underflow. This means that if `balances[msg.sender]` is less than `_value`, the subtraction could result in a very large number instead of a negative number, bypassing the `require` check. The subsequent line `balances[msg.sender] -= _value;` executes, potentially allowing for the transfer of more tokens than the sender possesses.",2599,138,2.3284308910369873

91,bad randomness,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable due to its reliance on the `blockhash` function to generate randomness, which is inherently insecure. In Ethereum, the `blockhash` function can only return the hash of the most recent 256 blocks, allowing miners to potentially influence or predict the block hash, especially since they control the block generation process. This means that using `blockhash` for critical operations that require true randomness, such as determining the outcome of a guess in this context, is susceptible to manipulation and exploitation by miners or other malicious actors.",2694,110,2.0762083530426025
92,bad randomness,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable due to its use of predictable randomness sources, which are susceptible to manipulation. In particular, the variables used to generate randomness include `block.coinbase`, `msg.sender`, and `block.difficulty`. These values can be influenced by miners or predicted by attackers to affect the outcome of the raffle, making the randomness vulnerable to exploitation. These vulnerabilities are present in the following lines:

- `address seed1 = contestants[uint(block.coinbase) % totalTickets].addr;` (Line 99 in the first contract)
- `address seed2 = contestants[uint(msg.sender) % totalTickets].addr;` (Line 101 in the first contract)
- `uint seed3 = block.difficulty;` (Line 103 in the first contract)

These elements make the contract's randomness predictable and manipulable, making it insecure for use in scenarios requiring true randomness.",4255,182,3.3115346431732178
93,bad randomness,"YES

The second contract is vulnerable due to the same issue with randomness as the first contract. The `rand` function in both contracts attempts to generate a random number using the hash of the previous block. This approach is predictable and can be exploited by a malicious user. Miners can control the blockhash and, consequently, influence the outcome of the random number generation. This predictability and the possibility for manipulation make the contract vulnerable.",4393,87,1.909090280532837
94,bad randomness,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability arises from the use of block properties to generate randomness in the `makeBet` function. Specifically, the line `bool won = (block.number % 2) == 0;` is problematic because block properties such as `block.number` can be influenced by miners. This predictability allows malicious users to exploit the contract by placing bets when they know they can win, undermining the randomness the contract aims to achieve. This is a ""bad randomness"" vulnerability.",2823,104,2.008129358291626
95,bad randomness,"YES. The vulnerability in the given smart contract code is related to its attempt to generate a random number. The function `GuessTheRandomNumberChallenge` uses `uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now))` for randomness. However, this approach is predictable because both `block.blockhash(block.number - 1)` and `now` (the current timestamp) can be influenced or predicted by miners. Therefore, the generated ""random"" number can be guessed by a malicious actor who can replicate the same hash computation, making the randomness unreliable and vulnerable to exploitation.",2586,120,2.380882740020752
96,bad randomness,"YES, the contract is vulnerable. 

The `RandomNumberGenerator` contract attempts to generate randomness using `block.timestamp`, `block.number`, and `blockhash`. These functions and variables are predictable or can be influenced by miners, making the randomness susceptible to manipulation. 

- **`block.timestamp`**: This is a predictable value and can be influenced by miners within a certain range, making it unsuitable for secure randomness.
- **`block.number` and `blockhash`**: The `blockhash` function retrieves the hash of one of the most recent 256 blocks, which can also be predicted by miners. Furthermore, there is a risk of the `blockhash` returning zero for blocks that are too far back, leading to unreliable randomness.

The smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability arises from the fact that in the `withdrawFunds` function, the external call to `msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)()` is made before the contract's state is updated.

The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in the `Collect` function of the `DEP_BANK` contract. This function performs a call to the `msg.sender` with the line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())`, which attempts to send ether to the address of the caller. This is done before updating the `balances` mapping to subtract the withdrawn amount.

This line transfers the requested amount `_am` to the caller's address using the low-level `call` function, which forwards all available gas. If the recipient's address is a contract, it could contain a malicious fallback function that initiates another call to the `CashOut` function before the balance of the caller is updated. As a result, the attacker could drain the contract by repeatedly calling the `CashOut` function.",2991,134,2.524550676345825
111,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.

In the `PERSONAL_BANK` contract, the vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function on the line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())`. This line sends Ether to the `msg.sender` using a low-level call without first updating the state to reflect the withdrawal (i.e., decreasing the balance before the transfer), which can potentially allow the caller to re-enter the contract while the call is not yet completed.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious contract, which would receive funds from the `PERSONAL_BANK` contract and, in its fallback function, trigger the `Collect` call again before the transfer is complete and the balance is updated, effectively draining the funds by repeating this process.",3165,158,2.749405860900879
112,reentrancy,YES. The smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability arises because the `withdrawAll` function allows a call to an external address (`msg.sender.call.value(oCredit)()`) before updating the state (`credit[msg.sender] = 0`). This means that an attacker could potentially re-enter the function and withdraw funds multiple times before the state is updated to reflect that their `credit` has been set to zero.,2595,88,1.7767479419708252
113,reentrancy,"YES

The smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability is present in the `withdrawBalance` function, which uses `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)()` to send Ether to the user's address before setting `userBalances[msg.sender]` to zero. This pattern allows an attacker to repeatedly call the `withdrawBalance` function before the balance is updated to zero, enabling them to drain the contract's funds. This is a classic example of a reentrancy vulnerability, as described for the `EtherBank` contract depicted in your initial message.",2584,115,2.676823139190674
114,reentrancy,"YES. The given smart contract code, specifically the `ETH_VAULT` contract, is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `CashOut` function where the `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` is used to send Ether back to the caller. This operation sends Ether before updating the state variable `balances[msg.sender]-=_am;`, allowing a malicious contract to call back into the `CashOut` function recursively and withdraw more funds than it is entitled to before the balance is updated.",2955,106,2.329158067703247
115,reentrancy,"YES

The vulnerability in the given smart contract code lies in the `CashOut` function, specifically with the line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())`. This line of code is susceptible to a reentrancy attack. 

Here's how the vulnerability can be exploited:

1. The `CashOut` function allows `msg.sender` to receive ether using a low-level call with `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`.
2. If an attacker creates a malicious contract that has a fallback function which calls `CashOut` again before `balances[msg.sender]` is decremented, they can exploit this by recursively calling `CashOut` to transfer more ether than they have deposited.
3. Since the balance deduction (`balances[msg.sender]-=_am;`) occurs after the ether is sent, the state update regarding the user's balance happens after the ether transfer, allowing the caller to repeat the withdrawal multiple times.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should use the ""checks-effects-interactions"" pattern: update the contract's state before interacting with external addresses, ensuring that the state change happens before the external call. Additionally, using `transfer` or `send` instead of `call` could reduce susceptibility to reentrancy attacks, as these methods throw errors if the external call runs out of gas.",2955,263,3.7315146923065186
116,reentrancy,"YES. The smart contract named `WALLET` is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability is present in the `Collect` function, specifically at the line where it uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`. This line attempts to send Ether to an external address using a low-level call, which allows the called contract to re-enter the `Collect` function before the state (the balance of the sender) is updated. This can enable an attacker to repeatedly withdraw funds before the balance is correctly decremented, potentially draining the contract of its Ether balance.",3041,116,2.7057151794433594
117,reentrancy,"YES. The given smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawBalance` function, where the contract transfers Ether to the `msg.sender` using `call.value`. This allows the sender's code to be executed and potentially call `withdrawBalance` again (or use functions like `transfer`), before the state variable `userBalances[msg.sender]` is reset to zero. As a result, a malicious sender can exploit this to withdraw more funds than they are entitled to, repeatedly draining the contract of funds.",2627,111,2.568547487258911
118,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The reentrancy vulnerability exists in the `withdrawBalance` function. Here, the contract transfers Ether to the address of the caller before updating the `userBalance`.

119,reentrancy,"YES, the given smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability is present in the `CashOut` function, which uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` to transfer Ether to the caller. This call facilitates a reentrancy attack, where an attacker can recursively call the `CashOut` function to withdraw more funds than they are legitimately entitled to before the `balances[msg.sender]` is decreased. To mitigate this risk, the contract should update the state (i.e., decrease the balance) before making the external call or use functions like `transfer` or `send` which provide limited gas and thereby reduce the risk of reentrancy.",3029,136,2.550753116607666
120,reentrancy,"YES

The smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack, similar to the initial code you provided. The issue lies within the `CashOut` function, specifically at the line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())`. This line attempts to transfer Ether to the caller using the low-level `call()` function, which can be intercepted by a malicious contract executing a fallback function. Before the balance is updated (`balances[msg.sender]-=_am;`), an attacker can repeatedly call `CashOut` to drain the contract's funds.",2931,111,2.350158214569092
121,reentrancy,"YES

The given smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability occurs in the `Collect` function where it uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` to send Ether to the caller. This external call allows the caller to execute arbitrary code, potentially including a call back to the `Collect` function before the `balances[msg.sender]` is decremented. This could allow an attacker to repeatedly withdraw funds and deplete the contract's balance.",3083,95,1.9069671630859375
122,reentrancy,"YES, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `CashOut` function within the `Private_Bank` contract, specifically in the line:

```solidity
if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line uses `call.value()` to send Ether to the `msg.sender`, but it does so before updating the sender's balance. This opens up the possibility for a reentrant call, where the `msg.sender` can execute the `CashOut` function multiple times before the transaction is finalized, depleting the contract's funds. To mitigate this vulnerability, it's important to follow the ""checks-effects-interactions"" pattern: update the state (i.e., reduce the balance) before making an external call.",2945,158,2.404263734817505
123,reentrancy,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function, specifically in this line: 

```solidity
if (msg.sender.call.value(_am)())

This line uses a low-level call to send ether to `msg.sender` without updating the internal state of the contract (i.e., deducting the amount from the sender's balance) before the external call. An attacker can exploit this by recursively calling the `Collect` function from a fallback function, withdrawing more funds than they are entitled to before the balance is updated.",3041,120,2.841106653213501
124,reentrancy,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. Similar to the first code snippet, the vulnerability lies in the `CashOut` function that uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` to transfer ether. This low-level call allows for reentrant function calls because the balance is updated after the external call. An attacker can exploit this by recursively calling the `CashOut` function before its previous execution is completed, potentially draining the contract's ether.",2931,94,2.058974027633667
125,reentrancy,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability lies in the `Collect` function, where the contract uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` to send funds back to the caller. This is an unsafe pattern as it allows the caller (a potentially malicious contract) to re-enter the `Collect` function before the contract has a chance to update the `balances` mapping. An attacker could exploit this by recursively calling the `Collect` function to withdraw funds multiple times, thus draining the contract of its Ether. To mitigate this, use the checks-effects-interactions pattern, or consider using a non-reentrant pattern such as OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard.",3085,141,2.3523406982421875
126,reentrancy,"YES

The smart contract contains a reentrancy vulnerability in the `withdrawBalance` function. The vulnerability is present because the contract transfers the amount to withdraw using `msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("""")` before setting the user's balance to zero. This allows a malicious contract to re-enter the `withdrawBalance` function and repeatedly withdraw funds before the user's balance is set to zero, effectively draining funds from the contract.",2543,85,1.831864833831787
127,time manipulation,"YES, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable. The vulnerability comes from the reliance on the `block.timestamp` in the `isSaleFinished()` function within the `LiterallyMinecraft` contract. This function checks if the current block's timestamp is greater than or equal to a specific timestamp (1546300800). Since miners have some control over the block timestamp, this could be manipulated, potentially leading to an early or delayed execution of the function's logic that depends on the time condition, making it vulnerable to time manipulation attacks.",2452,106,2.4710843563079834
128,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability arises from the use of `block.timestamp` for generating random numbers and its use in decision-making. Specifically, the use of `now` (an alias for `block.timestamp`) in the `if` condition on line 13 in the `payOut` function introduces a vulnerability, as miners can manipulate the timestamp within a certain range. This can potentially be exploited by adversaries to influence the logic of the contract. Additionally, using `block.timestamp` for randomness is insecure, as it is not truly random and can be predicted or manipulated by miners, compromising the fairness and security of any random-based logic.",2686,132,2.9916293621063232
129,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the reliance on `block.timestamp` for the function `resetInvestment`. The `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners, which allows them to potentially alter the timing of when the `resetInvestment` function can be executed. This manipulation could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the funds in the contract.",2854,73,2.344149589538574
130,time manipulation,"YES

The vulnerability lies in the usage of the `now` keyword, which is an alias for `block.timestamp`. This allows miners to manipulate the timestamp to potentially execute the function in their favor. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in the conditional checks using `now`, such as `require(now != pastBlockTime);` and `if(now % 15 == 0)`, which rely on the timestamp. These lines introduce the potential for timestamp manipulation attacks. Miners could adjust the block time to meet these conditions and, consequently, drain the contractâ€™s balance.",2554,113,6.0619871616363525
131,time manipulation,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the use of `block.timestamp` for generating randomness in the `play` function of the `EtherLotto` contract. This line:

```solidity
var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;
```

uses the current block timestamp as a source of randomness. Since block timestamps can be influenced by miners, this makes the contract susceptible to manipulation. Miners may predict or control the outcome of the pseudo-random number generation, leading to predictable or biased results in the lottery game. This vulnerability is related to time manipulation and poor randomness practices.",2664,127,3.6946897506713867
132,short addresses,"YES, the smart contract code is vulnerable to a short address attack. This vulnerability stems from the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) itself, which may accept incorrectly padded arguments when processing transactions. In the `MyToken` contract, the `sendCoin` function does not enforce strict input validation or argument length checks for the `address to` or `uint amount` parameters. An attacker could potentially exploit this by submitting a transaction with incorrectly encoded parameters, leading to unintended behavior or misallocation of tokens. To mitigate this vulnerability, it is important to implement input validation to ensure that all transaction parameters are correctly formatted and of expected lengths.",2711,126,2.2813494205474854
133,denial of service,"YES. The smart contract is vulnerable to a gas limit denial of service attack. As seen in the `emptyCreditors` function lines, when the `creditorAddresses` array exceeds 1500 in length, an attempt to reset the array by creating a new one with a length of zero will be made. Due to the potentially large size of this array, the transaction might run out of gas, preventing the `emptyCreditors` function from being executed successfully, which could lead to a denial of service.",2679,103,2.7072594165802
134,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable to denial of service attacks. This vulnerability is similar to the one identified in the initial ""DosNumber"" contract.

The problem arises in the `insertNnumbers` function where it allows for potentially large and unbounded loops due to the `for(uint i=0;i<numbers;i++)` loop. If `numbers` is set to a very high value, this will result in the function running out of gas since Solidity does not optimize loops like high-level languages do. The issue is exacerbated by the use of dynamic array resizing: 

1. `if(numElements == array.length) { array.length += 1; }` dynamically adjusts the length of the array, which can lead to high consumption of gas.
2. `array[numElements++] = value;` assigns a value to the array. This also contributes to increasing gas costs, especially when performed many times.

These can collectively be exploited by an attacker to create a situation where execution of the contract's functions are too costly in terms of gas, leading to a denial of service if the gas limits are exceeded. This prevents legitimate users from being able to interact with the contract effectively.",2779,238,3.9084360599517822
135,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability in the smart contract code is due to the potential for a denial of service attack, specifically related to the lines where `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` arrays are reset to empty arrays using `creditorAddresses = new address[](0);` and `creditorAmounts = new uint[](0);`. This can lead to issues if the contract's storage grows significantly large, as resizing large arrays can be costly and may exceed the gas limit, effectively causing the `lendGovernmentMoney` function to fail and preventing further operations involving these arrays. This can potentially lock the contract or inhibit its intended functionality, leading to a denial of service for users trying to interact with the contract. Additionally, the contract makes direct ether transfers using `.send()`, which can also lead to issues if the recipient is a contract that uses more than the provided 2300 gas, causing the transfer to fail and potentially blocking the code execution.",3753,190,3.1568503379821777
136,denial of service,"YES

The smart contract remains vulnerable due to the same 'denial of service' issue described in the original contract. The `refundAll` function attempts to send refunds to each address in the `refundAddresses` array using the `send` method. If any address's transfer fails, the entire function call will fail due to the `require` statement. This means that if even one recipient rejects the Ether sent to them or runs out of gas, it will block the refunds for all subsequent addresses, effectively causing a denial of service for all other refund operations.",2662,113,2.2357349395751953
137,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability in this smart contract is a potential denial of service (DoS) due to high gas consumption. Specifically, the `ifillArray` function contains a loop that can iterate up to 350 times, adding entries to the `listAddresses` array. As this array grows, the gas required to execute this function increases significantly. If the array becomes large enough, the function may consume more gas than the block gas limit allows, making it impossible to execute successfully. This possibility can prevent the function from being called, causing a denial of service for any further attempts to use the contract's `ifillArray` function.",2556,128,2.344611406326294
138,denial of service,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the line `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` within the `bid` function. This line is susceptible to a denial of service attack because if the current frontrunner is a contract that refuses to accept the payment (e.g., by reverting or running out of gas), the `send` function will fail, causing the entire transaction to revert. This prevents other users from outbidding the current frontrunner, effectively halting the auction. A safer approach would be to use the `transfer` pattern or OpenZeppelin's `pull payment` strategy to handle payments safely without relying on external code execution.",2550,140,2.9060096740722656
