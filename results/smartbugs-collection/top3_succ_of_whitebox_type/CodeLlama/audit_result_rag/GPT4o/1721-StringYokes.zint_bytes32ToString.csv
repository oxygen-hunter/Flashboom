11,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability exists in the `newOwner` function in both contracts.

This can lead to unauthorized access and ownership manipulation, allowing malicious actors to gain control of the contract without proper restrictions.",1325,71,8.0013906955719

The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function on line 30, where it incorrectly checks `require(amount >= balances[msg.sender]);`. This condition should be `require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);` to ensure that users can only withdraw up to their current balance. As it is, users could potentially call the function with any `amount` greater than their balance, which would bypass the intended check. This is an access control vulnerability related to incorrectly managing authorization of withdrawals.",1180,96,5.958416700363159
15,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable because the `IamMissing` function is public and can be called by anyone, allowing any user to become the owner of the contract.

18,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. 

The vulnerability is an access control issue in the `PushBonusCode`, `PopBonusCode`, and `UpdateBonusCodeAt` functions. These functions can be called by any address, not just the contract owner.

The lack of access control on these critical functions opens the contract to abuse by external parties.",1234,92,8.220457792282104
19,access control,"YES. The vulnerability lies in the constructor function. In Solidity version 0.4.24, constructors must have the same name as the contract.

1. **Line 20**: In `function initWallet() public { creator = msg.sender; }`, the function is marked as `public`.

This access control issue allows an attacker to potentially take control of critical contract functionalities like `migrateTo`.",1198,89,8.632758855819702
21,access control,"YES, the contract is vulnerable because it uses `tx.origin` for access control, which is insecure.

25,access control,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in the same use of `tx.origin` for access control in the `withdrawAll` function.

26,access control,"YES, the given smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the use of `delegatecall` on lines 31 and 38 of the `FibonacciBalance` contract. The function `delegatecall` allows the execution of code from another contract (`fibonacciLibrary`) with the calling contract's context (storage, memory, etc.). This means that the external library can modify the state of the calling contract, which poses a security risk if the external contract is untrusted or compromised.

1. **Line 31**: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(fibSig, withdrawalCounter));`  
   This call allows arbitrary code execution from the `fibonacciLibrary`, which could potentially be malicious or unintentionally modified, allowing attackers to exploit the `withdraw` function and drain funds.

2. **Line 38**: `require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(msg.data));`  
   Here, the `fallback` function forwards all incoming data via `delegatecall`, allowing external entities to execute arbitrary functions within the contract's context. This can be exploited to execute unauthorized code and manipulate the contract's state.",1464,224,18.017187356948853

80,arithmetic,"YES, the smart contract is vulnerable.

The vulnerability lies in the `run` function, where the line `count -= input;` can cause an integer underflow.

The vulnerability still exists in the `increaseLockTime` function. Specifically, the line:

The smart contract is vulnerable due to the same arithmetic issue as the previous contract. Specifically, in line 23 (`require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`), there is a risk of an integer overflow when calculating `numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN`, which could lead to incorrect validations. Additionally, in line 25 (`balanceOf[msg.sender] += numTokens;`) and line 33 (`msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);`), there is a risk of integer overflow and underflow when performing arithmetic operations on `numTokens`.",1245,116,9.664977788925171

The vulnerability lies in the `run` function (line 32), where the subtraction operation `count - input` can result in an underflow if `input` is greater than `count`.

The vulnerability is present in the same part of the code as before:

- Line 35: `count -= input;`

86,arithmetic,"YES

The contract is vulnerable due to the same issues present in the first contract. The arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, and subtraction) involving `count` can cause overflows and underflows in lines 28 (`count += input`), 34 (`count *= input`), and 40 (`count -= input`).

The vulnerability exists in the same location as the previous contract:

The contract is vulnerable due to the predictable randomness sources used in the `chooseWinner` function. Specifically, the contract relies on the following:

1. `block.coinbase` (line 99)
2. `msg.sender` (line 101)

The vulnerability lies in the same place as the previous contract:

- **Line 38**: `bool won = (block.number % 2) == 0;` uses the block number to determine the outcome, which is predictable and can be influenced by miners, making the randomness exploitable.

This makes the contract vulnerable to attacks where a malicious user can predict or influence the outcome.",1381,80,6.563796281814575
95,bad randomness,"YES

The vulnerability is still present in the code because the contract uses `keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now)` to generate the ""random"" number, which is predictable.

The vulnerability stems from the reliance on the `now` (alias of `block.timestamp`), which can be manipulated by miners to control the contract's behavior, such as triggering the transfer condition when `now % 15 == 0`.

This function will consume a large amount of gas if the `creditorAddresses` array grows excessively (e.g., over 1500 addresses), leading to a potential denial of service (DoS) due to gas exhaustion.

This can make the contract unusable when large numbers are inserted into the array.",1338,80,6.728105068206787
135,denial of service,"YES

The vulnerability lies in lines 46 and 48, where the arrays `creditorAddresses` and `creditorAmounts` are reset to new empty arrays.

The vulnerability is still present in the second contract because the line `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` can cause a denial of service. If the current frontrunner is a contract with a fallback function that consumes all gas or reverts the transaction, the auction contract will be unable to send the bid back, thus preventing further bids.
