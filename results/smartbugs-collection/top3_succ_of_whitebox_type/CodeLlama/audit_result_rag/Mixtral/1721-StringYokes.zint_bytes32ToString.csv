Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.",1094,150,8.817592859268188

78,arithmetic," Yes, the smart contract is vulnerable. The function `zint_bytes32ToString` in the contract multiplies a 256-bit unsigned integer (`x`) by 256 (2^8) for each byte in the loop, which can lead to integer overflows and cause unintended behavior. In this case, the vulnerability is not directly in the `run` function, but the vulnerability in `zint_bytes32ToString` can potentially affect the security of the entire contract.",529,111,6.512118101119995
79,arithmetic," NO. The vulnerability in the first contract is due to integer overflows, which is not present in the second contract.
