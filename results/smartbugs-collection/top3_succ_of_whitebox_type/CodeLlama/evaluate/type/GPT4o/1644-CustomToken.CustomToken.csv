This lack of error checking can lead to scenarios where the `transfer()` function may appear to succeed even though the actual token transfers failed.

This call does not update the contract's state before interacting with the `msg.sender`, which allows the `attack` contract to exploit this by recursively calling the `airDrop` function. The `attack` contract's `supportsToken` function makes another call to `ModifierEntrancy.airDrop`, causing the contract to enter a recursive loop before the original call completes.
