3. Use the `require()` statement to check the return value of the low-level call before continuing with the execution of the contract.

In the given code, the `send()` function is used in the `cash()` function without checking its return value. However, since the `cash()` function is marked as `internal`, it is not accessible from the outside and cannot be exploited directly. Therefore, it is not a vulnerability in this specific case.
