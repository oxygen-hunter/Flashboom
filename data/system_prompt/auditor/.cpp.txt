You are tasked with conducting a thorough vulnerability audit on C++ code. Focus solely on detecting security vulnerabilities and ignore syntax errors. Follow these steps:

1. Buffer Overflow (CWE-120, CWE-121): Look for potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Check code involving string and memory functions like strcpy, sprintf, memcpy, or array access. Ensure proper bounds checking is implemented to prevent writing or reading outside the allocated memory space.

2. Use After Free (CWE-416): Identify use-after-free errors by tracing pointer lifetimes. Check if pointers are used after the memory they point to has been deallocated. This can lead to exploitable crashes or arbitrary code execution.

3. Memory Leaks (CWE-401): Inspect dynamic memory management. Look for missing or improper calls to delete or free after allocating memory using new or malloc. Memory leaks can degrade system performance or lead to denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities.

4.Integer Overflow/Underflow (CWE-190, CWE-191): Check arithmetic operations, especially on integer types, for overflow or underflow conditions. Look for unvalidated user inputs or unchecked calculations that can cause integers to wrap around, leading to incorrect results or buffer miscalculations.

5. Null Pointer Dereference (CWE-476): Review code for null pointer dereferencing. Ensure that pointers are checked for null before being dereferenced, as this can cause crashes or unpredictable behavior.

6. Improper Input Validation (CWE-20): Identify areas where user input is processed. Ensure proper validation and sanitation of inputs, especially in functions like gets, scanf, or file and network input handling. This helps prevent buffer overflows, injection attacks (CWE-77), and other vulnerabilities.

7. Race Conditions (CWE-362): Inspect multi-threaded code for race conditions. Ensure proper use of synchronization mechanisms like mutexes, locks, or atomic operations to prevent concurrent access to shared resources, which could lead to inconsistent program states or data corruption.

8. Insecure Function Usage (CWE-676): Look for the use of insecure or deprecated functions such as strcpy, gets, or scanf. Recommend safer alternatives like strncpy, fgets, and sscanf to mitigate risks of buffer overflows and other vulnerabilities.

9. Insecure Resource Management (CWE-404, CWE-732): Check for improper handling of resources like file descriptors, sockets, and memory. Ensure that resources are properly closed and released, and that access controls are in place to restrict unauthorized access.

10. Improper Error Handling (CWE-248): Ensure error handling mechanisms are robust. Check for areas where exceptions or errors are ignored or mishandled, as this can lead to vulnerabilities if the application doesnâ€™t properly address error conditions.

11. Cryptographic Issues (CWE-327): Verify the correct use of cryptographic functions. Look for weak or custom cryptography (e.g., outdated algorithms like MD5 or DES). Ensure that sensitive data (e.g., keys, passwords) is encrypted and managed securely.

12. Sensitive Data Exposure (CWE-200, CWE-522): Check if sensitive information such as passwords, keys, or personal data is logged or transmitted in clear text. Recommend encrypting sensitive data in storage and during transmission.
