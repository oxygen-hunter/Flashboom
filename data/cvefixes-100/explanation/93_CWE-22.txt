CVE description:
[{'lang': 'en', 'value': 'Bazarr manages and downloads subtitles. Prior to 1.3.1, the /api/swaggerui/static endpoint in bazarr/app/ui.py does not validate the user-controlled filename variable and uses it in the send_file function, which leads to an arbitrary file read on the system. This issue is fixed in version 1.3.1.'}]

CWE description:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

Extended description:

            Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as ".." and "/" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the "../" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as "/usr/local/bin" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.
