Integer overflows and underflows are not a new class of vulnerability, but they are especially dangerous in smart contracts, where unsigned integers are prevalent and most developers are used to simple int types (which are often just signed integers). If overflows occur, many benign-seeming codepaths become vectors for theft or denial of service.

The vulnerability lies in line 23:         require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);

The vulnerability lies in line 25:         balanceOf[msg.sender] += numTokens;

The vulnerability lies in line 33:         msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
